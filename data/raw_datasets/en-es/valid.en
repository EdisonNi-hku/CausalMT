I will be voting for the presidency package .
So far I hope that this 600 will be fine , but I have one important remark in order to eliminate all the controversies .
The need for an adequately-financed financed CAP , which delivers public goods , such as a secure and sustainable food supply for the EU , which ensures a stable food price regime both at the farm gate and on the shop shelves and which underpins a vibrant rural economy , is as important now as ever , especially in the light of the recent rise in energy prices and instability in certain regions of the globe .
These challenges have not gone away .

I understand that my colleague , Commissioner Byrne , together with the chairman of the Scientific Steering Committee , will give a press conference in Brussels at 6 p.m. this evening on the outcome of the meeting of the scientists .
However , it is at critical times like these that I recognise how hung up we all are with ideology and sentiments more suited to the 19th and early 20th centuries , rather than the 21st century .

I am pleased to say that the EU has managed to live up to those expectations and to play an important , and even leading , role in putting a stop to the hostilities , in keeping the ceasefire and in the efforts made to move forward the political process needed to consolidate the peace .
Introducing a true and meaningful &apos; own-resources resources &apos; system for financing the EU budget is the only way to achieve this and we are happy that the EP has thrown its weight behind this long-standing standing Green priority .
Since then the country has undergone tremendous political and economic changes : it became a member of NATO earlier this year and is now well on course to join the European Union on 1 January 2007 .
We may not agree with them and may not ascribe to them ourselves , but we should respect the right of Members of this House and other elected representatives to hold those opinions and try to bring them forward .

We are serious about the process of wide consultation .
I pray to God that I am wrong .

The judicial system is completely log-jammed jammed , so the citizens and companies operating in Croatia cannot effectively appeal for justice .
I should also point out that DG Sanco is carrying out an ongoing review of the Package Travel Directive , which will also deal with this issue .
The fact that the governments have so far failed to reach agreement on this is unacceptable to everyone .

And , fourthly , it showed us that , despite the fact that we spend 70 % of what the Americans spend on defence , we are almost entirely dependent on American equipment because we have something like 10 % of their capacity .
Most if not all of the Members here tonight are committed to developing that role and I pay tribute to a succession of rapporteurs who have tried to make a progressive contribution to the debate , including those here tonight .
How else do you explain voting arrangements that do not come into effect until 2009 causing the collapse of the IGC ?
I commend the aims of this report to make aviation safer and more efficient for all involved .
I take the view that this is not a problem of Slovakia alone , but a broader European problem whose solution is very complex and requires a partner-like like approach .

Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mr Pex for personally pushing this item onto the agenda of the House .

This is an aspect of our negotiations with Turkey that will have to be dealt with in a particular and robust way .
A second area of concern is conflicts of interest , and many of my colleagues have referred to this already .
Let us stop making a crisis out of a drama .

Setting up a cooperation arrangement along these lines is the aim behind this initiative .
The solidarity dimension of the policy is central to this policy and the allocation of resources will certainly follow an inverse relation with the prosperity of countries and regions .
Nevertheless , can I ask you to confirm that it is quite inappropriate for Members of this House - Liberals or otherwise - to seek to persuade you to hear them .
I fear that the critical poverty targets clearly identified by the Secretary of State could be undermined by the weaknesses of the current trade proposal .
The socio-political political base provoking the changes in the Arab world is not dissimilar across those countries which are now in transition to what we hope will be a democratic environment .
The year 2007 will also mark a turning point in our search for an institutional settlement .
It is the new Mediterranean where the EU can contribute towards removing those dangers for the future of us all .
If we spend this money wisely , we will give them one meal every day .
Clearly , a lot more has to be done in all of these fields , but there has been progress and credit should be given where credit is due .
Tomorrow , when we vote in the light of a Commission opinion , I would make the strongest appeal to Members of this House to give the largest possible consensus .

A recommendation is grossly inadequate .
President-in in-Office Office of the Council . - This is a complicated and very big discussion .
This accident is perhaps the worst of its kind in Europe since 1921 , when an explosion at the BASF company in Germany claimed the lives of 561 citizens .
We therefore feel that , in this instance , we are not prepared to criticise the Commission for this underspend .
We now , with our increased powers and increased opportunities , should take that opportunity to discuss this issue here in Parliament and come up with ways and proposals on how we can actually help to clear that deficit and bring Europe closer to its people .
Mr President we have only a minute so I shall dispense with the pleasantries .
The report we are considering here gets this balance right but we still need to get away from the idea that government , in some sense , can resolve all of these issues .
We simply want to be informed of the current state of play , to be given explanations about the reasons for the delay , and to be reassured that these problems will be resolved .
We need it now .
Agriculture is one of our greatest assets .
Very briefly , to touch upon two points : first , on the action plan for Iraq , I share the view that it is extremely difficult to implement this action plan .

I have , myself , very positive experience of doing this .
Let me say straight away that I welcome the proposal by the Commission to extend European Community support for the International Fund for Ireland for a further two years .

I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .

We need to be more market oriented to simplify the burden of regulation and also benefit from the WTO talks .
With several hours of further debates ahead of me , I will have been able to spend the whole day in the Hemicycle , and what more could a man want - except perhaps to be lying on a beach in Langkawi ? !

The Commission intends to take due account of scientific opinion in the actions to be taken .
Mr President , what is at stake in this debate is whether the EU &apos; s commitment to sustainable development in theory , actually means something in practice , whether when push comes to shove , we are prepared to make some very difficult decisions .

German Deutsche AG diesel engines bypass EU embargoes by going to China and to Burma and the production of military small arms has been shifted to Malaysia , a country that has aggressive export plans for these arms and would not be subject to the EU Code .

Amendment No 11 , about which I shall be speaking in reply to some remarks made a little while ago , adds a further exception for broadcasters , framed in terms which were rejected by Parliament itself at first reading .

Our activities in improving financial governance are reflected in our annual activity reports , and the Court of Auditors has evaluated that they are getting better and better and more adequately reflect the situation .

Even if the EU moves closer to its 10 % target , the impact on food prices will be limited , in particular for two reasons : first , more and more biofuels will come from non-food food feedstocks or will be made from residues or waste .
We need to get the full costs involved in employing extra staff before we consider releasing the reserve , and I would hope Members would support that view .

First of all , in our view , the enlargement of the Union , the incorporation of other European countries in the liberal order of Europe , is the number one priority that we face in the next few years .

We recognise that there is a clear tension between the austerity being undertaken in so many countries and its impact upon social inclusion and the level of poverty .
So again I would like to thank the Commissioner and my colleagues for their warm words .
More Europe means more of that to which Europe brings added value to our citizens because , by clearly defining the limits of the Union &apos; s competences , the Reform Treaty or the Lisbon Treaty , gives both the European Union and national parliaments clear definition as to where their competences belong , and confers , incidentally , more subsidiarity on Member States , a point often lost .
The EU should take a stronger position on this case .
Mr President , firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur , Ms Evans , and the Conciliation delegation , for their invaluable work paving the way for final agreement on this sensitive dossier .

Article 18 of the agreement explicitly clarifies that it is without prejudice to the rights , obligations and responsibilities of the Community , the Member States and the Russian Federation arising from international law , in particular from the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention , the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and the 1984 UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment .

The problem is much the same as that experienced by Nigeria in that there is a very strong Muslim presence in the north of the country , and a Christian one in the south .
The Lisbon Strategy already covers the most important of those policy responses , but it focuses less on the long term than the demography debate .

Six people have died as victims of the unofficial dirty war that has already killed 66 other victims since 1977 .
I think that is important , not just for Latvia , but for all our countries .
As I have said before , even if Member States were to face labour market shortages , they would be free to cap the total number of migrants they are ready to admit , if they consider , for instance , that their society is already facing too much of an integration burden .
This report , and the Commission proposal that lies behind it , certainly echo this call .
The outcome of the vote which takes place tonight in the Committee on Institutional Affairs , where , as you know , there are 134 amendments to the text on the IGC , will not be available for consideration by the groups before the deadline for amendments expires .

On 3 May , representatives of the European industry met with my colleague Sir Leon Brittan to explain the situation .
We cannot have a good Christmas , we cannot have a good conscience , if we do not see what is happening to our near neighbour .
My point is not that such occasions are not worthwhile : on the contrary , such is the need for greater action at European level that the Union could and should have four formal summits every year , as foreseen in the Treaty of Nice .
Many of us who genuinely care about the future of Europe believe that active citizenship will play an important role in the continuation of the European project .
Let us be clear on this point .
First of all , labour inspection services , employers &apos; organisations , trade unions .
That is why we urge colleagues in other groups not only to support greater transparency in the way in which these negotiations are conducted , but also , as Mrs McNally has already said , to give strong support to filling the current vacuum in the Convention and making sure that the European Parliament more generally gains the right of assent over all future GATS and WTO agreements .

Mr President , in our debate last night on the Colom i Naval report on the financial perspectives 2000-2006 2006 , it was drawn to my attention that the indicative list of vote for this morning at 11 a.m. is recommending that this interinstitutional agreement should be approved by a simple majority .

I rue the day when we might be ruled by the extreme right or the extreme left .
I would personally be very happy if the Council would propose something in the trialogue meeting on which we could then base the compromise , but it is hiding and not coming to meetings and it is not organising trialogues .

In the light of the Amsterdam Treaty and the work in Parliament by Mr Avgerinos , for example , on improving the way we deal with urgencies , we have to try to make a fresh start on human rights and to have a trialogue between the Council , the Commission and Parliament where we can sit down and start to define where we are going on human rights and how we can improve the administration of human rights .
Mr President , Mrs Echerer , having kept us all informed on a subject which too often is relegated to the sidelines of our debates here , has shown herself to be a late night performer deserving of her intellectual property and of successive royalties .
Many scientists dispute this and recommend more research with adult stem cells to achieve the same results in curing diseases .

The Commission is confident that the interinstitutional cooperation already set in place will produce the necessary positive results to allow the budgetary authority to determine favourably the budget for 2000 .

I am please to say that the Commission can accept Amendments 1 , 5 , 13 , 15 , 22 and the package of amendments 25 to 37 .
We need to create trust but , until these new systems are in place , there is no reason why consumers should not enjoy the same rights on-line line as they do offline .
That is why we are recommending that the Council or relevant permanent representation should also be represented at our meetings so that they develop a greater understanding of the problems citizens face and respond effectively .
So we could hardly have timed things worse . The second unfortunate fact is that the directive concerns a tax and it will therefore be the Finance Ministers who decide on it .

The EU delegation - both governments and civil society - gave strong messages of commitment to further progress .
In order to make this proportionality test easier , the Commission will present an amended handbook as a guideline for the application of the proportionality test .
The difference between their approach and our approach is that they have seen an approximate 15 % increase in carbon dioxide emissions while the European Union of 25 has seen a considerable reduction compared with 1990 levels , and the 15 member countries under the Kyoto regime obligations are 1.7 % under the 1990 level .
Inaccurate and uncontrolled declarations are useless and bring the whole system into disrepute .
Parliament has insisted , throughout the negotiating process , on the need to ensure that the directive has a strong ambition on all the essential points .
The Commission may disclose copies of the letters of formal notice and recent opinions when none of the exceptions to the regulations I mentioned apply - i.e. when the infringement procedure has been closed and there is no longer any likelihood that the investigation could be undermined .
There is a multiplier effect .
I hope that the Commissioner will undertake a review of the timescale for preparing legislation to prevent problems of this sort , which I am sure are as disappointing to her as they are to us .
Of course , one should never forget the fact that making citizens adopt environmentally friendly lifestyles is not just a market-based based issue : creating an environmentally caring consciousness also involves proper education and learning from an early stage and continuing throughout life .
I look forward to regular daily contact with parliamentarians , so that together we get this meeting right .
Apart from food safety and the strengthening of the internal market , other consumer interests also needed to be taken into account .
I can also vouch for the necessity of maintaining effective controls .
The Commission communication on the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables had three aims .

Let UNWRA carry out its mission .
If the Commission is negotiating on behalf of 27 Member States and on behalf of the EU , then it is essential that we know what the negotiating position is , and also that there is a full impact assessment on what is being proposed to show how it will impact on EU industry .

Far too many people ( particularly young people ) suffer burns and scars because of faulty fireworks or mishandling .
And yet more status quo .
We have simultaneously excluded produce from countries where often agricultural export is the main generator of revenue and , rubbing in the salt , exported our own surpluses - dumped ineffectively our surpluses - on their markets .
This result cannot be ignored , either on the basis of a lower-than than-normal normal turnout - what price legitimacy ? - or because some people feel that the only good referendum result is a positive one .
I believe that where we in this House are , as the Commissioner rightly pointed out , building up relationships , through the Legislators &apos; Dialogue between the European Parliament and Congress , we would hope , in the longer term , to see that turn into a form of transatlantic assembly .
But emission-sensitive sensitive charging already exists : it is called fuel duty .
We are now facing stronger competition on our supply markets , as well as rising prices owing to heightened competition from a number of emerging economies . At the same time , those emerging economies are raising barriers to access to their raw materials , thereby distorting competition .

We have conglomerates in this market and we need to guarantee that independent actors can act freely .

This follows on from discussions which the Scottish office has had with the industry .

Whenever we face a long-term term challenge , it is essential that Europeans can look to their democratically-elected elected representatives to explain why reform is essential , to put short-term term change in the context of long-term term purpose , to convince us that every one of us can play a part , for example through doing what we can on energy efficiency .
This was made abundantly clear over and over again by me and by my officials . So I am astonished that some people were surprised that later on we said that for the automotive industry itself and not components as such , operational aid can no longer be given although investment aid can .
The important - and I think the instructive - outcome of the case is plain .
Indeed , as a Member of the European Parliament who represents the east coast of Ireland , this is an issue which is close to my heart .

There was not a single minister able to explain that .
Mrs McCarthy referred specifically to issues surrounding products and toys . They are not part of this debate , but we will have a chance to discuss them with the Commissioner at the committee meeting next week .
We need some constitutional change to enable the committees to work properly rather than the House as a whole acting as a committee .
We asked the Hong Kong authorities to ensure that the Article 23 proposal would not be used to silence opposition .
That is why I am very happy that we will have more space for voluntary service in Europe .
- Madam President , allow me to explain why I voted against the Florenz report on climate change .

I wish it was not but I would like some firm comments from the Vice-President President of the Commission to reassure my constituents that they will not be sold out .
I would argue that it is a surer foundation on which to build popular support for Europe than a simple recitation of past achievements .
This adds to the merit of the two rapporteurs , Mrs Scheele and Mr Trakatellis , who have managed to approach very distinct positions and to work out some viable compromise solutions .
That brings us on to Category 5 .
Therefore , it must realise that further consequences will follow .
If it is intended to ban driftnets , then logic would suggest a ban on beam trawling or indeed any other method of fishing deemed to be deleterious to the environment .
Whilst very regrettable , the cull was perceived at the time as the most effective measure to end the outbreak .
Vice-President President of the Commission . - I tried to do my bit by visiting Ireland last week .
. - Mr President , I too want to thank Mr Grech for his hard work and the excellent report he has produced on the guidelines for the 2007 budget procedure .

I am opposed to opening the floodgates on production as this , I believe , would solve nothing .
The Accession Treaty for both countries now needs to be finalised and we hope that it can be signed after receiving the assent of this House during the spring of next year .
Second , and crucially , a separate closed system for aviation is crucial at the very least as a pilot scheme because , apart from the administrative difficulties of including aviation in the EU &quot; s general ETS , many sectors already in that scheme are concerned about the possible effect of aviation &quot; s inclusion on carbon prices , noting that as a sheltered sector , aviation will be able tolerate higher prices than many others .
In late October , Yemeni officials reported that they had intercepted a vessel laden with weapons from Iran .
We must also be careful that we do not endanger the balance of spending between budgetary lines too much , because many are near the minimum possible level of appropriations .
I expect to see a better relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the interest of all the countries in the southern Mediterranean area .
There was a good report last month ; we want to see that report by Mr Whitehead put into effect as quickly as possible .

In my group we are against the inequalities between the North and the South .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs of the relevant committees : firstly , Mr Westendorp y Cabeza , who has considerable on-the the-ground ground experience of these matters in Bosnia , and also Mr Lagendijk , with whom we have a regular dialogue on southeast Europe .
The European Parliamentary Labour Party has a particular problem and is fundamentally opposed to the proposal that 10 % of the seats be elected in a single constituency comprising the whole of the European Union .
I would like to thank you and , again , Mr Castiglione for this very difficult task of bringing together all the different opinions within the European Parliament .
The first thing that should be said here is that this process will require each of the Member States to draw up an action plan .
We have already had this system abused by Mr Le Pen and his Front National when in 1989 Claude Autant-Lara Lara was parachuted into this Parliament and made a farce of the opening of the institution with a lengthy and highly offensive intervention .
I agree in particular with Mr Watson that not only must we agree on a Constitution , but we must also be ready to sell it to our parliaments and peoples .
It is about admitting countries to a political and economic system which has brought peace , stability and prosperity to countries which spent much of modern history trying to destroy each other .
Mr President , first I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Medina Ortega and the members of the Committees on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer policy for all their helpful work on this issue .
- Madam President , I should like to explain that with regard to Amendment 17 , which should have come after Amendment 45 , both myself and my colleague next to me , Mr Grech , wanted to vote in favour of the demilitarisation of space , but unfortunately we were innocently distracted at that moment by a third party and we did not vote in this way .
But , for me and the Commission , we believe that this is a good Reform Treaty - not a perfect one : it is , of course , a compromise ; we would have wanted no opt-outs outs but really good support for what is in there on the Charter of Fundamental Rights especially , but we have a compromise , we have an agreement between all the Member States - and now we will make the best of it .
Our proposal stipulates that bottom gears cannot be deployed below a depth of 1 000 metres .
Mrs Ahern and others sometimes choose to use the Irish language within this Parliament .
If this is not allowed , then it tells us that the Treaty is not working , and that is why it needs review and attention .
Parliament should be taking steps now to ensure that the final shape of the legislation places firm obligations on Member States to achieve the objectives they claim they want to achieve .
I would like to hear the views of the Portuguese presidency , and maybe other presidencies , when others coming from the extreme right or indeed the extreme left enter government within the Union .
. The Commission is aware of the recent development of imports into the Community of footwear originating in China and Vietnam .
One should study the case of Japan closely .
In particular I want to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen for his excellent work , extraordinary dedication and excellent management of the whole process .

The report of the contractor will be given to all interested parties and will be published on the Commission &apos; s website .
Ireland has benefited enormously over the past ten years and we have made very good use of our structural funds .
That is straightforward best practice .
This is where the European Union has a special capacity and also special responsibility .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , it will not surprise you , but I do not welcome the conclusions of this report .
There is nothing more important than the safety of the food and the drink that they and their families partake of .

Madam President , first of all , I would like to congratulate Mr Lange on the completion of this important report .
Openness and transparency have always been the hallmarks of my political life , and , before Nick Griffin tries to smear the reputation of Members here , let him explain why the party he leads has failed twice to submit its accounts on time to Britain &apos; s Electoral Commission .
European exporters still face significant tariff barriers to other markets .
Parliament did everything it could to enable that to happen .
I urge progress to be made in finalising the legal arrangements as soon as possible and express the hope that in future , all Member States will see the imperative of being part of this system .
So to those such as Mr Bowe who say 1 % is a target that can easily be met , I say from experience that it cannot easily be met .
You could even ask yourself what the use of such a system is .
In fact , we should be looking at scoreboards on climate change and on aid , because what Mr Mitchell said earlier about credibility and the EU is correct .
In this regard I think we do not disagree with the honourable Member , because , as I said before , we have repeatedly underlined the importance of the supremacy of democratic civilian power over the military .
The rejection of the take-over over bids directive is a major setback to competitiveness in the Union and I challenge the other political groups and the Council to join us in speeding through the new Commission proposal under a fast-track track procedure , so that we can get it onto the statute book by the end of this year .
The source of this embarrassment is the wanton refusal of the minister to allocate sufficient funds to rural development .
Much has been done here , but there are continuing blockages in areas like VAT and public broadcasting .
Without the restored confidence of the latter , there cannot be a secure future for the former .
. Madam President , I should like to say to the Commissioner that when she first presented her proposals to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I applauded .
Madam President , there are two ways we can look at Kyoto .
Now some points for the future .
And that is what this House should now be preoccupying itself with , not with a retrospective over the last two or three years .

Californian venture capitalists expect nine out of ten investments to fail .

Mr President , on the Péry report , I am most amazed .
The power-sharing sharing deal has been negotiated under the auspices of the African Union between the current President Rajoelina and the former President Ravalomanana .
International human rights treaties are of no use whatsoever if countries do not sign , ratify and implement .
There is an amendment tomorrow to that effect , specifying how the Commission might review requests from sectors and Member States who plead a special case , and that amendment should be adopted , because this should not be used as a carte blanche simply to ignore the tax .
The second measure is to raise awareness of the benefits among users and public authorities through the establishment of a best practice Internet portal and European award schemes for smart homes - independent living applications for instance .
Will all the voices in the European political spectrum be heard ?
You are happy , it seems , that in 43 % of cases reported in the latest RAPEX-China China report corrective action was taken , but , Madam Commissioner , how about the 57 % of cases where no corrective action was taken ?
Our next President must dedicate himself to internal reform and successful enlargement .
That is being denied to the people of Cuba .
I hope that at the end of the afternoon we will have no more shenanigans , no more delays and we will make sure we get the vote at 6 p.m. so that we can get it through before the end of the Portuguese Presidency .
At a time when enlargement of the Union is a priority - and we have large-scale scale pre-accession accession aid programmes to assist this process - it is essential that we have the right number of staff with the right qualifications delivering and monitoring this assistance .
The key is the WTO and what happens there .
Much of the debate about free movement tends to neglect the fact that people from current Member States wish to work and establish themselves within the accession countries , and hence our interest in the state of those negotiations .
Instead , we should insist on one joint working programme for all institutions in the next year .
I should like to make one point clear to the Commission on this - I am not too sure that it is directed at DG XIX so much as DG XVI : we are not kidding , this is serious , we want to see the monies we have made available for Rechar and Retex implemented .
Incidentally , even the Israelis have now used this Single Treasury Account in order to transfer Israeli money .
Rather , they should draw on existing best practices in some Member States .
Parliament has discussed the issue very thoroughly over several months .
This needs to be addressed because the attitude of citizens to the internal market is affected by their experience in these areas , even if there is not competence for the EU in them .
Of course , the Commission will reply formally to your recommendations in the follow-up up report , to be presented after the summer , but , as you can see , we are already working hard to reinforce the management of the EU budget and improve the performance of our programmes .
Mr President , I want to address my comments to Mr Van Rompuy as one chairman to another .
I would think that the questioner would have as much access to that as I would .
I cannot understand how the Commission can go for a study by anonymous authors and ignore information provided by its own main committee .
These last six months have been important months in the political life of Britain and its relationship with the European Union .
If a majority of the House sends that signal to the world tomorrow by supporting our compromise resolution then we are also celebrating Independence Day , the day that Europe stood up for its values .
The budget of the Council is taking on ever increasing proportions .
However , when those comparative advantages are topped up by unfair and uncompetitive practice , we have a right and an obligation to act .
Many issues have been raised about composition .
There were concerns about whether market forces would win out over services of general interest ; and that people who were concerned about patients &apos; rights to choose , and to travel , were being pitted against those who were asking which patients would actually exercise that choice .
So we think that this should be tackled , mainly because all the economic evidence and the scientific evidence on economic functioning shows very clearly that companies with an balanced decision-making making structure have a higher return on investment and make more profits than companies with solely male decision-making making structures .
Capacity needs to be managed so as to be in balance with the productivity of the fish stocks .
We are also examining how CFSP instruments such as political dialogue can be adapted so that they are more robust , flexible and timely .
Mr President , there is almost no hope left that the presidential elections in Belarus next Sunday will be free and fair .
The truth is that we are bringing in regulations in Europe , and restricting production in Europe , whilst allowing imports into the European Union that are not produced to the same standards as they are in Europe .
. - Mr President , Africa has for too long been torn by civil strife , hunger , economic mismanagement and blatant corruption .
Secondly , the neighbours &apos; meetings , which the President-in in-Office Office of the Council mentioned , could contribute very substantially to reducing interference , improving security and allowing political dialogue and reconciliation among the various factions .
With the increased demand for foreign securities since the introduction of the euro , our infrastructure for clearing and settlement of cross-border border transactions remains fragmented , resulting in much higher costs than with national transactions .
We can try to add to the list the remaining Members wishing to speak , but I can tell you very honestly that it is impossible to have so many speakers ; I have about 30 .
Because this building is so badly designed , the lifts barely have enough capacity for Members as it is , without the security guards taking over two or three of them at precisely the time when everybody is coming down to vote .
Accordingly , I do not accept that the proposal on the ethics committee is satisfactory and on this I would expect the Commission to give us some answers .
This was our chance to have an agreement .
Likewise , the recommendations of the Commission and of the Council are being disregarded at this moment in time .
The Chinese Government goes so far as to imprison cyber-dissidents dissidents meaning people who create or manage websites whose content does not please the government like Mr Huan Qi who is being tried now .
The question is , will it work in the European Union ?
I think that loyalty was misplaced and has resulted in much of the delay .

Mr President , I am not certain I can follow the eloquence of Mr Fatuzzo in my explanation of vote .

A child &apos; s economic status is closely linked to that of their parents .
Mr President , I consider it an affront to democracy and humanity that Burma will be represented at the ASEM Meeting in Hanoi in October .
Furthermore we disagree with the choice of the simplified Treaty revision procedure .
But once that consultation process has taken place and once the scientists in the Member States and in the agency have come to a conclusion on the appropriate way forward in any given situation , particularly with regard to a food scare , the opinion of the agency should stand , should be respected , should be followed and should not be challenged .
Many have suggested that the budget is too small .
Vice-President President of the Commission . - I shall be very blunt .
For instance : buildings - the potential in efficiency in the building sector is of utmost importance ; appliances - electric appliances such as ovens , air conditioners , kettles , toasters , etc. are becoming more efficient ; transport - research and development have made cars more efficient in energy consumption .
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments .
Moving on to the various proposals within the work programme , I welcome the initiatives now being taken on a communication on children &quot; s rights .
I have been reliably informed that summers usually end about 21 September and the Commission is still striving to meet a deadline , although I must admit that the case is of such complexity that it will need a thorough investigation by not only the MARKT directorate-general general but also by other parts of the Commission .
The resolution has no formal effect at all , but is merely an expression of how Parliament feels .
I hope that rather than compulsory expenditure like that , being left to grow year by year , it should be looked at very closely .
It is too narrow in scope .

It is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and we know that it is deeply unsustainable .
This high-tech tech university will promote life-long long learning and make higher education accessible to those who might not normally have the opportunity .
Having said this , there is obviously a need in the European Union for further cooperation and eventually mergers .
These proposals deserve the serious attention of the Member States and the other Community Institutions .
But there is a very important principle here .
It is not merely that she is not proposing any amendments - although that is an example that some rapporteurs might follow with advantage , rather it is because she has recognised the overriding importance of taking this legislation forward and putting it on the statute book .
Its idea of democratic dialogue is only one way : the EU does not listen to what people have to say and only tells them what they can think and how they can vote .
State aid for innovations should be provided for those innovations and processes that otherwise would not take place in normal marketing or in normal business .
I shall pay particular attention to the amendment on Members &apos; assistants , as it is a matter of concern in this House .
It is a very clear and concise plan with regard to the kind of protection and mechanisms that can be put in place to guarantee that the Kosovars &apos; rights are represented and maintained .
The letter sent by Secretary Clinton to President Buzek , raising concerns regarding SWIFT , was woefully late in the day .
The Council &apos; s decision to include , as part of the treaties - for the first time ever - the negotiation results in the final aspects of accession must be considered as a serious limitation of Parliament &apos; s budget rights .
Latvia will adopt the euro in 2008 , Lithuania and Slovakia in 2009 and Estonia in 2010 and they will be hamstrung by EU regulation , EU targets and by the EU continually meddling in their economic affairs .
In conclusion , I would like to insist on the importance of ensuring high waste-recycling recycling rates and improved resource efficiency in the extraction sector .
The presidency &apos; s commitment to consultation and dialogue remains absolute .
The Commission has long been concerned about child pornography on the Net .
I believe that so long as the Commission shares that aim , we should be able to work together .
If you look for civil justice in this , you find a bit of contract law dressed up as consumer law .
Mr President , on 27 February three people claiming to be members of the Brigade broke into the Medellín office of human rights lawyer Jesús María Valle Jaramillo .
I would also hope that the unavailability of slots will not be a barrier to joining the SISOne4ALL .
We are implementing a number of measures , working together with the Chinese authorities , in order to address this issue .
Why else would the EU be developing a strategic partnership with China , whose government shows scant regard for freedoms we consider to be essential ?
I do not know about Switzerland ; we do not have any indications that Switzerland is behaving problematically in this field in Europe in general .
I am very pleased to inform you that we have with us here today a delegation of Members of the Croatian Parliament , the Sabor .
I do not mind people earning a lot of money but I feel that sometimes this brings with it extra responsibilities , particularly in an area where there is an international dimension .
However , these are points that I seek to put in the context of certainly the area that I represent and I daresay they are points that would be supported by Jillian Evans on behalf of her party .
We believe we need to continue to pull together towards our common aim of ensuring that we are better prepared to protect our citizens against future health threats .
This is the question which has to be decided in the European Council at the end of this month .
This information should be available , not only to ensure transparency but also to assist in the traceability of products .
The third part of our deal is that these issues need to be monitored .
Austria also paved the way for emigration to third countries .
We have to find them , both by being better and more efficient - I agree with that - but also by recognising what we have to do .
There are a number of key issues which I have raised which must be on that agenda .
These negotiations involve addressing the complex and often detailed set of regulatory frameworks of countries in areas as diverse as those reflected in the last section of your report - from financial services to health care or education .
And I think that this shortness is justified , for , in a time of crisis , we should work to manage the crisis and not spend time on lengthy votes .
If it were very simple , we would have done it by now .
This coup , I think , represents a serious and evident breach of the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement regarding democratic principles and the rule of law .
In the Kingdom of Spain where the employment rate of women is probably the lowest in the European Union , it hardly reaches 30 % of the active population .
The market predators will never endlessly attack any vulnerable opening , despite the painful austerity measures taken by all Member States .
In conclusion , I would strongly highlight that the European welfare system and measures as stipulated in this directive are of value and not a burden to the European market .
The answer is to improve the legislation , which is why we voted against Amendment 24 and Amendment 16 , which was both unhelpful and unnecessary because it does not deal with the legislative imperative .
Also , to suggest that airlines will be able to obtain compensation from third party providers is fanciful .
No Member of this House can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many Iraqi people find themselves .
Indeed , strict and fair conditionality must be applied to all candidates and potential candidates to whom we make these promises .
It is with a certain degree of concern that I note the continuing high percentage of such complaints .
I should like to welcome him to his office with no irony at all - as we have heard from one or two other Members - and thank him for that very positive answer .
Some commentators have seen a great deal more in this role ; others have seen less .
In both my visits to Gaza , I called for a greater opportunity for the people there to develop the economy and provide jobs and a future for their children .
I would say to those who argue on behalf of the expanded single market and its dynamism , look at the facts .
After the war in Iraq the Middle East region has become more unstable and it is incumbent on us all to ensure that we get the peace process in the Middle East back on track .
They set political priorities .
Mr President , I would just like to pass on my good wishes to the Bureau for the taking the enlightened decision to remove the photograph of Robert Maxwell from Parliament &apos; s premises .
What we are trying to do in this case is to find a combination of actions within the framework of this information and consultation .
There are many different kinds of problems , but I will only refer to the problem of the flooding last weekend .
It is very important to remind us of the Schuman Plan : grounded on solidarity , first of all , at the beginning of the European Union and then in the 1990s ; last century in Central and Eastern Europe , today on the financial markets and , in the very near future , in the Mediterranean region .
I am sure that the PPE leader , Mr Poettering , will look very favourably on your application .
Does the Commission agree that the UEFA home-grown grown players &apos; scheme is compatible with the Treaty ?
Some trade restrictions are acceptable in view of the social environmental problems that are so obvious .
I voted in favour of this report , but would like to stress some key aspects in relation to fisheries policy .
Our quarrel is with bin Laden who shelters in Afghanistan and with the Taliban , they seem to be almost one and the same , and we pity the situation of the Afghan people .
I know you will be addressing some of the anomalies that exist in this but , as Mrs Eriksson has rightly said , they exist in a significant number of Member States and it could cause serious problems in terms of discrimination when we come to implement charges .
If those independent experts give it a clean bill of health , we should respect that and , just as we often pass condemnatory motions on Slovakia , we should also respect good news when it comes from Slovakia .
As some colleagues will know , at the moment I am doing some work on regionalization of the common fisheries policy .
Digital libraries would surely benefit many researchers , students , teachers and - as one specific group - people with physical disabilities .
I am always very conscious of looking at ways in which we intervene , through our support and through the instruments at our disposal , to back up and support initiatives on the ground - home-grown grown initiatives - as being often but not always the best way forward .
In so doing , we will continue to see the fruits of the policy and ensure that rural development has a future beyond 2013 .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , very briefly a couple of points .
Those are the matters which really concern the fishermen of Northern Ireland .
Yet two weeks ago , Commission President Barroso rolled out the red carpet for the man responsible for those atrocities - President Nazarbayev - with not a single word of criticism .
I would like also to examine the proportionality , or lack of proportionality , in this report .
The regionalisation / zoning of DVDs sees massive price differences across regions which consumers can only access by adapting illegally their DVD players or purchasing pirate DVDs illegally , as a global single market in their product has been prevented by technological chicanery .
I know the Commissioner will take this forward and I ask him to do so with the incoming Irish presidency and future presidencies so that the Walter report does not lie in the filing drawer covered in cobwebs and dust .
The European Union is rooted in the values of democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms , which we strive to protect and promote after having suffered , until very recently , violations of basic human rights on our own continent .
in writing . - The Ferreira report deals with the amendment of Council Regulation No 708 / 2007 , which established a framework governing aquaculture practices in relation to alien and locally absent species .
As a result of a dispute on whether Laval had to sign up to the Swedish collective agreement and whether it had to pay the average Swedish wage in the construction sector , the Swedish construction trade union blocked the construction site .
The Commission is not an unaccountable bureaucracy as some eurosceptics would have us believe .
We do not need that kind of supra-national national inspectorate .
This blockage in the means of implementation meant that we were unable to achieve the breakthrough we were looking for in Bali .
Such a forum would provide an excellent platform for us in engaging our partners , but also for our partners to engage with each other .
While the EU backs the Copenhagen proposals to further the deindustrialisation of the West and the corporate domination of the Third World , a growing majority of ordinary people regard climate change as an elite scam - an excuse to tax and control us and to impose internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of the nation state .
I also agree that the breakthrough came with the acceptance of the T90 codend , which could be used as an alternative to the BACOMA trawl .
We have seen it in churches , families and communities , where a blind eye has been turned , leading to some of the scandals of which we are aware in our various Member States .
It is in the power of the United Kingdom government , the German government and other national governments to remove that threat by complying with the habitats and birds directive .
But unless the EU agrees to the long-term term possibility of eventual EU membership for that delightful country , it is inevitable that whoever wins has only one economic option : to look east to Moscow .
Not only that , but we are talking about energy efficiency , yet we continue to come to Strasbourg , which emits tonnes and tonnes of needless extra CO2 .
Finally , as far as the coherence of the licensing arrangements is concerned , we must ensure there will be no distortion of competition and guarantee the implementation of the licensing directive .
Further to my question , as the Commissioner has just stated , the Commission is now drawing up its &quot; whistle-blowing blowing &quot; charter to a certain extent .
Their most significant success is securing agreement that this Parliament will scrutinise the budget of the Service .
But if he would like a straightforward answer now , then it has to be that the Commission cannot intervene .
The European Commission , the European Parliament and the Member States of the European Union agreed to establish the &apos; Youth in Action &apos; programme , which puts into effect the legal framework to support non-formal formal learning activities for young people .
The Commission also continues to have a target of 40 % of females on evaluation panels and this is monitored regularly .
And , President Santer , nothing would prove the political commitment of the European Commission more than if they insisted on such a revision .
Without it , Europe could not have recovered from the devastation of the world wars .
For 2001 the amount may be somewhat higher at around EUR 12 million .
I think that it is wrong - and I speak as somebody who is a social democrat of many decades standing who , I think and I hope , has a developed social conscience - to put forward a proposition in the case of services that state provision is good and that private provision is bad .
Congratulations to all concerned .
On the one hand , it is an important management tool for our own institutions .
Until all Member States are able to assure us that there is full compliance , this proposal , if passed , will simply add to the list of laws which have not been implemented .
I know that Council and Parliament will need to work to find a balanced solution .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you for this debate .
Thank you all for your contributions and thank you also to Mr Swoboda .
It was a report I was particularly interested in and I voted on it .
A lot has been done , but there is a lot to do .
rapporteur . - Mr President , this report is the first in a package of measures dealing with the energy markets in the EU .
To Mr Bonde , I wish to say that he is at the wrong debate .
in writing . - The proposed Directive on the revision of the EU Emission Trading System is an improvement on the current system and is important at a global level .
Two years running we voted to allocate resources from underspent budget lines to buy this much-needed needed equipment .
I am also speaking on behalf of my friend and colleague Mr Deprez when I point out that there are a lot of people in Brussels and in this Parliament whose families are in Morocco .
