It is also clear that it has been a longstanding political objective of Mr To@@ ledo &quot; s present government of Peru to seek the return of former President Fuj@@ im@@ ori from Japan to face trial on charges of corruption and human rights violations during the long conflict with S@@ end@@ ero Lu@@ min@@ oso and Tu@@ pa@@ c A@@ mar@@ u .
If you are saying to other countries - whether Georgia or some of the former Yugoslav Republic@@ s - that we will not aw@@ ak@@ en hope for them , is there not the danger that they will be pushed into unrest , internal stri@@ fe , possibly violence , and the pressures for migration to the West will be increased ?
However , since the code of conduct was introduced , the market for the sale of air tickets has changed considerably as alternative sales channels have developed .
We have to support that here in the European Parliament .
Mr President , I would be very sorry to shock Mr L@@ und and , if I can explain my thinking on this , perhaps it might relieve your concerns .
I have mixed feelings and some doubts .
Africa has all too many examples of how the actions of human beings prevent other human beings from building better lives for themselves .
We have to respond to this challenge by putting the emphasis on our competitiveness , innovation and ability to respond to change and to compete more effectively in the future .
What I am trying to say is : please I need your help - and I am calling on you Commissioner Almunia - I want you to understand that people will simply not understand that we , the European Union , are not capable of fulfilling our duty to regulate the financial market in a comprehensive way , so that we can be sure that this situation will not occur again ; and that we can finance this expansion exactly as Commissioner Almunia described .
This is a matter of serious concern to us .
I wish to share this experience with you , friends .
For immigration , there are a series of guarantees and safeguards which apply to what we call &apos; sensitive data &apos; . Sen@@ si@@ tive data can only be processed in exceptional cases , in cases of public interest ; they are subject to suitable safeguards , and those suitable safeguards have to be provided by the country concerned .
The right to cultural development and other fundamental rights is increasingly facilitated by these technologies .
The prime goal is greater cooperation between the European Union , the United States and other major players on macroeconomic policy and reforming regulation of the financial sector .
We have seen that time and time again especially in Wales and Britain where we have had no legislation on information and consultation to date .
We need a clear picture of the other measures that are planned towards this end and how they will combine to bring it about .
So the health issues in favour of high tobacco taxes are not clear cut but , even more importantly , we do not believe in the upward harmonisation of excise duties or , in particular , the upward harmonisation of tobacco taxes .
Mr Santer understands that this group and those who voted for the resolution were voting for a stronger European Commission , a stronger Europe , and we will keep him to those commitments .
We have also raised the position of individuals like Fl@@ ora Bro@@ vina and the very brave Serbian journalist Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Fi@@ li@@ po@@ vic .
I am quite happy to come back here at whatever time is necessary to give my explanations of vote , because I want to do that for a number of reports .
Some governments in Africa might cut the Commission red tape by dis@@ regarding our offer of development aid , which is extremely dangerous , since by that we lose our opportunity to guide those countries in the right direction .
The other provisions of the directive relating to daily and weekly rest breaks , annual leave and night@@ work will , of course , apply to junior doctors after a three @-@ year transposition period just as they do for all other workers .
The British public in 1975 will have read in the documents that this is about an ever closer union and not a free @-@ trade area .
Such desperate people cannot think of democracy and human rights in the way we do from our houses and leaf@@ y sub@@ urb@@ s in the West .

I welcome the recent ac@@ quit@@ tal of the British and Dutch plane @-@ spot@@ ters on sp@@ ying charges in Greece and the fact that the appeal court had the integrity to put right the original mis@@ carri@@ age of justice that the conviction represented a year ago .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , the situation in Thailand is deteriorating by the hour ; human lives are at stake ; it appears to be a much more important item for an urgency debate for this Parliament to deal with on Thursday .
We salute the ongoing commitment of Commissioner Papoutsis to renewable energy .
It is important that everybody follow certain standards , and that we do not create the conditions which would seriously undermine this .
It is a great challenge for many people involved in sport to increase their interest in sporting activities .
This is not to say that we could not do more but it is much better than the picture in general .
It recognises the problem , which is that the economies of Europe need to be more competitive and that Europe is rapidly losing its competitive position , but then sets about devi@@ sing measures that are either irrelevant or will actually make the problem worse .
There is no possible justification for this deliberate attack on the livelihood of European steel workers .
We cannot allow a situation to develop in which , as one econom@@ ist was quoted today as saying , &apos; the Services Directive could end up as a good example of &quot; death by Parliament &quot; &quot; .
An important milestone in the reform of the common fisheries policy was in the field of governance through the creation of the regional advisory councils .
I believe that you are laying yourself open to a real risk , and not just to public health .
I see no reason for its suppression and hope very much that you will appreciate the entirely valid reasons I have set out as to why it should be approved .
Secondly , I would like to mention that our committee wishes to maintain all its amendments at this stage , especially those relating to Eurostat .
In the mean time , we have the un@@ constitutional and unsatisfactory situation of a civilian care@@ taker government with the support of the military trying to keep law and order in an increasingly desperate and violent climate .
With respect to the first , what the Commission is trying to do here is to deal with the issues of paid employment , seasonal workers , people who want to come in on the basis of an independent economic activity , study and vocational training , n@@ ong@@ ain@@ ful activities and family reunification .
Firstly , we must reduce the isolation of the Burmese people .
El@@ ected Members must exercise greater care and concern when drawing up development policies that will ultimately affect Union citizens .
I should like to point out a few reasons why the coverage of biometric risks or guarantees should be kept optional .
That body held a meeting , and we held discussions with it , on Sunday .
Can we ask the Bureau to look into this fact .
Mugabe should remember his promise to step down and do so now .
The fourth point concerns ways of informing domestic workers of , and strengthening , their rights .
This report needs to be seen in the context of the wider package however : Over the coming months we must work to ensure that these new laws strike an overall balance between the needs of rail users and the interests of the service providers .
Therefore , Member States will have to include a comment in the long @-@ term residence permit and will be obliged to consult the Member State that granted protection in cases of possible expulsion .

The Commission will present the remaining proposals , notably on access to justice and the application of the convention to Community institutions , by the end of the year .
The Commission fully supports this compromise , which reflects to a large extent the amendments proposed by Mr Sz@@ ent @-@ Iv@@ án@@ yi in his report .
Obviously - and I will finish with this point because I am well over my time - we have to learn from this case and raise our alert level as regards other places in Europe that could potentially be a source of danger in the future .
For example , it is the EU which is ruth@@ lessly driving forward the agenda for a new , ambitious , comprehensive round of trade talks at Doha in November in the face of opposition from the majority of developing countries and of social movements around the world .
I can only agree that our situation is very fragile .
I can assure both Members that the European Union raises a lot of human rights concerns with the Chinese Government at the bi@@ annual European Union @-@ China human rights dialogue , which is a regular high @-@ level exchange .
Commissioner , thank you for that small insight into women in business .

On unemployment , the EM@@ AC committee on which I served has put forward that there should be a compulsory rule about late payment .
I hope that their views will also be sought in the months ahead .
Mr President , a recent poll in Ireland showed support for the Reform Treaty to be at alar@@ mingly low levels of just under 25 % saying yes and over 62 % un@@ decided .
Furthermore , this project needs major European financing , and this is not going to be easy with European defence cuts .
Mr President , this has been a very useful debate .

Russia is , and should be , a strategic partner and an important neighbour to the European Union .
However , may I say also that E@@ mili@@ a Müller has suffered one of the worst ass@@ aults by people outside this Parliament that any Member has had to put up with .
I give an example of Amendment No 13 where the word &apos; rights &apos; is omitted and only the word &apos; obligations &apos; remains .
Secondly , in relation to research - which is extremely important - our committee is now working with the Seventh Framework Programme .
High@@ er energy prices mean that energy @-@ intensive businesses in Europe will simply give up and go away , to more favourable jurisdictions .
There is need for further reinforcement of coherence and effectiveness in the external activities of the European Union cutting across the pillars .
The Commission hopes that the recent arrangement between the Government of Burma and the ILO , handling the complaints against forced labour , will help the victims .
We must be consistent during the entire cycle .
Thirdly and finally , as regards mainstreaming gender in Community research policy and programmes , work programmes under the cooperation @-@ specific programme encourage female participation .

I would like to see some clear responses and some action regarding the proposals made by the Parliament both last year and indeed this time around .
The Member States - and there are many who already comply with the Strasbourg Court obligations - are unlikely to have to incur any expenses in addition to what they already spend on this .
This is what we shall be discussing today in this Chamber .
I am pleased to inform my colleagues that Mr K@@ lich and I have agreed on a comprehensive text which , I believe , reflects the views of both committees .
Continu@@ ally pushing back the closure of Europe &apos; s airspace every six to eight hours has meant that passengers could not plan journeys by other means and airlines themselves have been kept waiting for progress .
In my view , this is not necessarily a moment of celebration : I prefer to see it as a moment when we have to be wise and to look at what we have achieved so far and what we want to achieve in the future .
The flexibility of cohesion policy makes it possible to implement the best measures adopted for each case .
If I have to fence my house , put up b@@ urg@@ lar al@@ arms , catches on the windo@@ ws , etc . , it may be good for the economy , but it is not good for my quality of life .
The committees and the Commission hope to come to very close first @-@ reading agreement on two important instruments .
He spoke with real knowledge and a sense of urgency , given the scale of the challenge we face .
That is not enough of an economic link , it must be greater than that .
We need to think about this approach in a very comprehensive way .
That is the UK Liberal Democrat website , which , for example , claims that Liberal Democrats are the main opposition to the British Government and that they have policies .
We should be trying to exercise those powers in a way that is even more democratically accountable .
Fortunately , we now have the Lisbon Treaty .
Many of the details are exchanged between the Commission and the Member State , but there is a fear that if these were in the public domain they could be used or misused in such a way that would undermine the whole procedure .
Their real concern is not about human rights . It is that the accession of a popul@@ ous , proud and asser@@ tive Muslim country would re@@ tar@@ d their dream of a federation , of a country called Europe .
As you know , the Kyoto Protocol contains no provisions on how companies can use J@@ I and CDM credits .
Mr President , since our debate last year on enlargement , there has been very considerable and commendable progress .
Dr Fr@@ ans@@ en has worked in Africa herself , so she was a mine of information .
This may seem a small thing but we already know academic freedom , political debate and anti @-@ radicalisation work are being limited by fears eng@@ en@@ dered by such legislation .
The cooperation opportunities of the two continents are enormous .
We see in front of us three of the re@@ signing Commissioners , and I should like to say on this point that the original proposals on Agenda 2000 showed courage and vision on the part of the Commission .
So the issue is not how we stop it , but how we harness and manage it .
We no longer need to hold sessions in Strasbourg .
President of the Commission . - Of course , human rights are part of the European Union but we have a system based on the rule of law and we assume that all Member States , including your country , are countries governed by the rule of law .
Some EUR 500 million has been disbursed since 2003 .
Others - and we are in this camp - want to improve our results so that they match our ambitions .
Which instruments do we need to bring together ?
That makes it impossible for Members to be here .
A visit to Man@@ agua should be made .
Mr President , I would like to inform the House , and for that matter the Commission , that the new Ambassador of the United States of America to the European Union , Mr Bo@@ y@@ den Gra@@ y , is a lawyer with a special interest in public finance .
We know that EU citizens have serious reservations about EMU but they are sleep @-@ walking into it without a proper debate .
The technical work would thus be out of the way before we move on to the political work .
That is where we are compared to China and the US .
Additional new areas of research are included and are part of the justification for doubling the funds .
Let me just make some specific points .
Let me just say one thing about that .

He wants a referendum every five minutes .
Why is it that we congratulate ourselves on being substantial donors of aid to developing countries and , at the same time , we devise partnership agreements that force poor countries to lay b@@ are their markets to European economic ambition ?
Good and even enforcement of Community environmental law is essential and anything less falls short of public expectations and undermines the reputation of the Community as an effective guardian of the environment .
It is from this humanitarian perspective that we demand the immediate release of Gilad Shalit .
However , int@@ ric@@ ate discussions in the Council - which took more than two years , sp@@ an@@ ned four presidencies and included two extra background reports - have demonstrated that prohibiting o@@ estradi@@ ol is not as straightforward as was first imagined .
Mr President , I would like to thank the President of the Commission for delivering the Commission &quot; s programme very much in a political context .
So we have got to have security of our own food supply within Europe .
There were some specific complaints .
I would also like to cooperate with Parliament to ensure that citizens &quot; complaints about violations of the fundamental rights mentioned in the Charter can be brought before the Court of Justice if an important issue of principle cannot be resolved in any other way .
The Court suggests that any such measures need to take the following considerations into account .
It is providing strong leadership and a clear vision for all of us in Europe on a whole range of complex issues , from drugs and crime through to the difficult preparations for enlargement .
Many Member States are currently contributing much less than this .
Tackling women &apos; s poverty would be beneficial for all of us - not only for women , but also for men .
The recitals of our resolution make clear the grim reading of what has happened over recent months .
Europe , either as a whole or separately , will fail to protect its manufacturing and its agriculture from Third World competition at its peril .
Financial assistance must support the population and must support the reforms which the country has to implement , as encouraged by the Union .
The coordination between the Commission and the three Member States has been reinforced both in developing the Sy@@ nergy and in working with the Organisation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( B@@ SEC ) .
The S &amp; D Group demands a change in global governance and in the EU in order to better implement workers &apos; rights and working conditions .
Moreover , close collaboration with the World Bank and the IMF has enabled us to ensure the consistency of our respective analyses and the complementarity of our assistance .
F@@ ares from the UK are amongst some of the lowest , showing what effect having three major carriers operating out of one country can have on competition and pricing .
Honourable Members know that there are about one million Egyptians in Libya , and about one and a half to two million people from the African countries that sur@@ round Libya who are currently there , and we know from what we heard is happening in Tri@@ poli that there are about two to three thousand African people at the airport who are waiting to see how they are going to leave .
That is what we need .
Probably this was because of the high initial capital requirement and other over @-@ cautious restrictions .
The 36 % , 45 % , 55 % proposals at World Trade talks , together with the mid @-@ term review of the common agricultural policy - which includes proposals for decoupling and modulation - and the uncertain implications of enlargement , have created a climate of serious mi@@ strust in a Commissioner who wants to tear up an existing decision of EU heads of government after only two and a half years of a seven @-@ year agreement .
I have four specific questions to ask the new Commissioner .
Concerning specifically the financial impacts , the Commission fully understands the importance attached to the cost @-@ related elements of this proposal , and will continue to be attentive to the cost aspects during the next stages of the negotiations .
NGOs , government bodies , international organisations and local authorities must work together to deliver multi@@ sector emergency assistance to those in need .
However , we need new legislation now to close up the loopholes .
It is very important to tackle it from all of the different perspectives .
The EU &apos; s lack of self @-@ sufficiency in grain is becoming a serious issue , not just for the beef but also for the pig and poultry industries .
Due to this change in the situation , and as I wish to avoid a clash with Council if at all possible , I would like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment No 4 , which has now not been withdrawn .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I wish to thank you and the honourable Members for what has been a very constructive and useful debate on this excellent report .
The Council has duly taken note of the European Parliament &apos; s resolution on the arms embargo on China .
Mr President , I want to express my welcome and thanks to all those who voted with our resolution this morning .
First of all , on the legal basis .
However , it is up to the Member States to set and levy charges , albeit in a common framework .
The key ambition of the Commission &apos; s initial proposal therefore remains justified , and I applaud Parliament and , in particular , your rapporteur , Mr Fjellner , on taking this important proposal forward .
Under the Spanish Presidency the new charter for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises was put into effect to help European business grow and prosper more easily .
I hope very much that we can make progress on it .
My party decided , on balance , that we could not recommend the previous draft of the Constitution to our voters , but that is in the past , and we view your efforts with a fair heart and an open and constructive attitude .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report which simpli@@ fies the accounts process for small and medium sized businesses , reducing their administrative burden .
It is threatening to ob@@ literate decades of health and social development progress .
It is a very professional piece of work and we are grateful for that and the support for the rapid ratification of the agreement by Parliament .
I wish to reinforce that there are no blanket exemptions on access to documents .
In fact I am surprised that , whilst we are taking this legislation from a humanitarian point of view , one of the criteria that is absent when it comes to transferring a person from serving a sentence in one particular state to another is , in my view , the humanitarian aspect .
I speak as a son and a brother of three women in my family who have successfully run or participated in the running of small businesses .
I believe that these are basic preconditions for preparing young people to overcome this very difficult period and better prepare them for the next wave of jobs which , hopefully , will be created once the crisis has subsi@@ ded .
It will be a busy year and I wish you luck .
But is the EU prepared to accept the obvious and abandon the project ?
The EU should propose a code of conduct on relations with its main energy suppliers .
The mechanisms and procedures provided for in the directive update the existing ones and should ensure its efficient implementation in the years to come .
Mr President , Europe will gain the support of its citizens by coming up with practical initiatives that respond to what they expect from us .
In my country , the United Kingdom , for instance , I am very conscious that it is going to take quite a dramatic change of direction and a very rough gear change to meet these targets .
But I say again that while the matter may not come under this remit - and the Commissioner was quite right to say I was wrong in assuming that hormone beef was part of the trade negotiations - all this is connected with world trade and it is the kind of issue that will come up .
We also aim to start negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina soon , as long as the country fulfils the remaining criteria .
Thankfully , a local support group was at hand and offered help to Sean and his parents .
I fully understand the point made by Members that it important to have a way of addressing errors in the PNR area .
Mr President , the contribution made by the European Union through the San José dialogue to ending the horrific civil wars in Nicaragua , El Salvador and , more recently , Guatemala is very considerable and demonstrates quite clearly the positive role that the European Union can play on the world scene .
Then I would like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi on her use of language - the expression &apos; mu@@ mbo ju@@ mbo &apos; is not often used in Parliament but it is very col@@ our@@ ful and it explains precisely what she means .
That is not what we are about here .
A related issue concerns the budgetary powers of this Parliament , where different suggestions have been tabled to increase and decrease the role of Parliament in this area .
Second , the Commission can confirm that the European Community is committed not to include , in the economic partnership agreements and in other future bilateral and regional agreements with poor developing countries , any TRIPS + provisions which could affect access to medicines or undermine the TRIPS flexibility contained in the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and public health .
As a result of the quest for resources and climate change , the Arctic region is on the brink of a profound change .
I urge colleagues to support this resolution .
I know that many of my colleagues - for reasons that I respect - will wish to take a different view , but I urge everyone in deciding how to vote on this report to bear in mind just how imperative the need for conservation has become .
Just before I finish , I would like to inform you that I asked M@@ att@@ el what it has done with the recalled toys .
If you will allow me a personal comment , this is the place and time where I have to thank my colleagues in the office , my political advi@@ sor in the LIBE Committee who has been behind this strategy for years , and my head of cabinet in the last few years who has fought with me .
In particular , I would like to hear your views on this latest e@@ dict that has been passed down from on high regarding the rules governing Question Time .
There are some in particular whose activities bear on the sort of things we might find ourselves wanting to support through the rapid reaction facility , like the work being done by one of our special envoys in the Great L@@ akes region in Africa .
The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 8 , 18 , 27 , 29 , 42 , 43 , 47 , 54 , 60 , 62 , 93 , 94 , 104 and 105 .
You will need to be visionary and creative to take Europe out of the glo@@ om@@ y past .
Maybe they are in my office . But if I understood Mr Kinnock correctly , in his opinion the only way to respect the ceiling of the Financial Perspective is to abolish the other ten languages and just keep the language that I am speaking now .
We now have a chance to bring their concerns about poverty and our concerns about connecting with the people of Europe together .
There , the discussions between the services have gone reasonably well .
You then asked me about sh@@ ell@@ fish .
Yesterday , Mr K@@ illi@@ lea stood up on behalf of the Quaestors and said : &apos; It is not us , the Quaestors , the Bureau is responsible &apos; .
It is important for us to demonstrate our concern in this area .
I do not believe that helps public enli@@ ghten@@ ment .
Mr President , I wonder if it is possible to get a set of head@@ phones .
David Cameron should be ashamed of himself .
As regards the minutes , I stress that the ECB presents and explains its monetary policy decisions by means of comprehensive public statements at its press conferences which take place immediately after Governing Council meetings .
It is time that we moved on from the politics of 30 years ago when certain things could only be state @-@ provided .
This report does not speak about the reliability of biometric data itself .
At the same time it ill @-@ be@@ ho@@ ves those anti @-@ Europeans to dance on the grave of the Eastern European nations that are so anxious to join the European Union and to join us in this House .
What Ireland is doing is commendable and it might inspire other countries to do something similar .
I believe strict guidelines are necessary .
Human rights enjoy a high @-@ ranking importance in the European Union .
First , on cultural diversity - a key point in our Community - the diversity of characteristics in the schemes operated by Member States reflects the cultural diversity in the European Union .
It is therefore largely unavoidable that small tr@@ aces of GMOs will be transferred to conventional crops and their har@@ vested products .

I would like to thank the Commission President for his very skilful and diplomatic address .
The implementation of legislation on anti @-@ discrimination deals with issues surrounding the marginalisation of many in our societies , and also deals with some of the issues people have talked about this morning , in terms of respect for individuals and for what they can offer .
As a further check , it was also proposed to introduce an independent , high @-@ level advisory board .
Let me finish by thanking the Commission , the Commissioner , the rapporteur and my fellow shadows for their extraordinarily good cooperation ; without it , this level of ambition would not have been possible .
What we would like to do is catch the imagination of Europe &apos; s citizens .
He is more popular among the Arab people now than ever before .
Other areas where we seek to bolster European Union cooperative efforts towards Russia are the rule of law and democracy building , civil society , tw@@ in@@ nings as well as regional and cross @-@ border cooperation and , above all , the Northern Dimension Initiative , to which a number of Members referred .
N@@ inth , and this is a pet subject of Mr La@@ x , we would like to have flu@@ id border crossings .
The issue is not whether that apology is acceptable or not ; it is that the use of such powerful force so easily and so frequently is bound to result in &apos; technical mistakes &apos; , particularly when the threshold of consideration for human life is so low .
The suggested amendment will enable closer cooperation between Frontex and the immigration liaison officers &apos; network and that will improve the information exchange via a web @-@ based secure IT platform and ensure that the Council and Parliament are properly informed about the activities of these networks .
We have seen the Ho@@ loc@@ ene Ma@@ xim@@ a , we have seen the Roman Op@@ ti@@ mum , we have seen the Medi@@ eval W@@ arm Peri@@ od .
We are looking at how we might best support his Office , but we are not in the business of parallel structures .
However , the mechanisms in place across the Member States to implement these principles vary widely in practice .
That is what Foreign Minister M@@ ø@@ ller in the office of presidency is trying to do this week in the Middle East , taking to the region a roadmap which suggests extremely convinc@@ ingly what Europe thinks is the way to get back to peace talks and to get away from violence .
It is their duty to find out what their concerns are and I hope they will be addressed in the coming months .
the report by Mrs M@@ ati@@ as , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on a European initiative on Alzheimer &apos; s disease and other dementi@@ as , and
Some for instance say that we go too far in achieving the balance that we have tried to achieve and that this will put off and set back the development of biotechnology in Europe in the future ; that we are losing our good scientists to the United States .
But , Commissioner , all our trade agreements have a human rights clause in them .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ h had an 82 % turnout of men only , even though the Saudi Ar@@ abi@@ an electoral law states that citizens are eligible to vote .
Finally , one of the gentlemen said there are other countries as well that we have not debated on .
Thousands of scientists dispute the very existence of man @-@ made global warming , ci@@ ting natural cyclical changes that saw vin@@ ey@@ ards in Roman northern England and a Swedish army march over the frozen Baltic to Copenhagen in 16@@ 58 .
You will find them in the conclusions .
It is clear that Ireland , for example , has prospe@@ red as an independent EU Member State and it is fitting that in its role as EU presidency , Ireland will preside over this , the largest ever single enlargement of the EU .
We were made welcome and we saw some improvements in human rights and a willingness to open doors .
I think it is justified and is something that has a particular and circum@@ scri@@ bed focus and does not talk about the whole issue of Kashmir .
There must be a recognition that people have faith and have the right to express that faith .
Think of how much greater economic power and competitiveness we could have , if we were prepared to make sure that it was integrated on a Europe @-@ wide basis .
I hope this will help to clarify the concerns which I have registered over the last days .
The primary duty of the European Commission office in Montenegro will be to promote European integration and to promote the relationship between Montenegro and the European Union .
I am certain that approving the amendments to this directive has the potential to produce health and environmental benefits and will contribute to the objectives of the EU &apos; s resource efficiency agenda .
Our trade defence instruments can make an important contribution to ensuring both free and fair trade , thereby stimulating our competitiveness .
Vietnam has been a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since 1982 .
The N@@ E@@ RA study , as is well known because it is available , states that the changeover from European to international exhaustion would have a neg@@ ligible effect on prices .
These are the Philip Morris agreement , and subsequently the Japan Tobacco agreement in December 2007 , where the biggest tobacco corporations admitted that they had some shortcomings in dealing with fair trade in cigarettes , and paid substantial amounts of money to the EU budget ; they are also cooperating very closely to fight cigarette smuggling , which is not in their interests either .
It is a club that will take away your very rights to govern yourselves and , sadly , is increasingly beginning to res@@ emb@@ le the very political system from which you have just escaped .
The resolution supports our proposals and encourages us to implement and follow them up carefully .
Labour will not f@@ lin@@ ch from pushing for the highest possible standards in public life , whether in London , Brussels , Edinburgh or Manchester .
Yesterday the Commission took very important and courageous decisions : the Green Paper on energy efficiency ; a new sugar market reform - which shows , by the way , that the common agricultural policy can also be reformed .
The European Union was self @-@ sufficient in food until recently .
It is clear that without this cooperation Afgh@@ ans would never have accomplished what we have accomplished over the past three years .
Se@@ e@@ king to consolidate the areas of agreement that exist between Parliament , the Council and the Commission further enhances our chances of achieving sound results in the reform of this important body .
Lastly , I entirely agree with Mr Verhofstadt : I commend you in all your efforts to stabilise the Middle East and North African countries and , in particular , your condemnation of the killing of Christians in Egypt , but why , as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out , has President Assad of Syria been left off the EU sanctions list after the brutal killing of innocent civilian protesters by his forces in recent days ?
Looking at them@@ atically orientated research , we can clearly see the need to better support research areas such as energy and climate change .
But even if some of the more controversial amendments before us are accepted , I think that the Council and industry should understand that Parliament &apos; s representation on the Conciliation Committee will be positive and pragmatic .
Hel@@ ping to tackle the problem of youth unemployment necessarily involves tackling the problem of unemployment among young women .
I would , however , like this directive - which we will continue to work on - not just to be adopted , but also to be embraced , by all the stakeholders .
Coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ iting is a serious attack on European industry and on the European economy and on European innovation , because we are an innovation @-@ based economy .
We must therefore not drag our feet on this issue .
I have voted against this report , although some amendments have taken on board a few numbers of our concerns about the future of our continent .
in writing . - I welcome this report which highlights the new opportunities and new markets created by the nature and the technological development of the Internet .
Mr Teverson , you know very well that the current system is already a derogation from the Treaty .
The report also recommends that we bring to an end , although this will be phased in , the dual mandate whereby Members sit both in the European Parliament and in their national parliament .
Sometimes , the language that is used in terms of synergies and complementarity should not m@@ ask the important question that he has asked in terms of the importance of being rigorous as regards the role of the F@@ RA .
We have taken note of the concerns raised in the report , in particular the lack of neutrality in recovery rates , the difficulties with statistics and the risk of diversion of tax revenue from non @-@ reco@@ ver@@ able VAT on inputs .
First of all , my thanks for the innovative mood in this Parliament because , as some of you have said , it is about innovations , and you have to start innovations by addressing the way we deal with innovations .
Article 31 of the Russian Constitution , however , guarantees the freedom of assembly .
Indeed the Commission has postponed a number of planned missions in respect of residues .
We need to know why certain Member States have not correctly implemented these directives .
I am talking about instances such as that last week where Parliament was consulted for the fourth time in a year on a text of which half was missing .
This is why I welcome very much , in particular , Amendment No 7 by the rapporteur , which states that Hungarian can be used as a language of communication .
The intention is to show that it is applied in a balanced and proportionate way and it should be stressed that the directive must not be used to abuse the right of legitimate competitors to enter the market place , in particular that for generic medicines .
The oil price is high and likely to remain high , yet the cost of energy to consumers is going to be higher still in order to subsidise renewables .
I wonder whether the EU Human Rights Agency will provide that .
The Sinno@@ t@@ ts and the public have a right to know the facts .
They have not paid him for breach of contract .
As I mentioned , the trial against Mrs Zana was held at a State Security Court .
It is our job as a Parliament to place ourselves firmly behind those people in Turkey who are promoting democracy , to make it quite clear that we support those agents of the state who are saying that this is not the way to run it and that we support people like Ab@@ dul@@ lah Gu@@ l , who clearly was deeply upset by this activity .
Today I am pleased to announce that the College of Commissioners backed an integrated policy document that will deliver exactly what the European Union has l@@ acked until now : a genuine , single vision of the oceans and seas .
Secondly there are national patent offices .
Mr President , I would like to draw Parliament &apos; s attention to a case of blatant discrimination that is about to take place in the county of North@@ amp@@ ton@@ shire , which I and my colleague , Mr Helmer , represent .
Remember the fears about all the impact assessments and the wild figures about how much REACH was going to cost and the risk that this would lead to the European chemical industry disappearing from the shores of this continent and re@@ loc@@ ating in China .
Madam President , according to my information , the situation , unfortunately , is not as good as Mr von Habsburg has said .
I welcome that because it still gives an incentive to Pakistan to come into line with social and human rights standards between now and 2014 in order to qualify for GSP + in 2014 .
You have made some reform progress but not enough .
However , I do not believe that , in the case of the Balkan visa waiver , political considerations have overri@@ dden these technical standards .
Mr President , I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this historic debate .
It is a useful tool , but it is a relatively modest proposal ; it is a voluntary scheme based on a United States model .
In fact , the only employment she can get is with French private schools as an anim@@ atri@@ ce , which is a very low grade of occupation .
We actually had the same objective .
The Commission is by far the largest contributor to the fund , with EUR 50 million over three years , mainly for nuclear @-@ related projects .
I call on all Irish MEPs to protect the Irish environment and peoples &apos; health by voting to strengthen the Directive on the Rel@@ ease of G@@ ene@@ tically En@@ gin@@ e@@ ered Organis@@ ms in the Environment .
The best way is to stimulate the creation of new jobs .
I wish to begin by thanking the Commissioner and all those who have taken an interest in the report for being here this evening .
The rapporteur , Mr Moscovici , Mr Mei@@ jer and others made some remarks about signals from Romania that the president @-@ elect wants to renegotiate the results .
We all want to see Europe lead the way in global research , which means spending existing research budgets better , getting them to work as a catalyst leading to increased industry research funding in the European Union .
I agree with Mrs Korhola .
The Commission , in a spirit of compromise , and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of that proposal , can accept the substitution of the obligatory provision on correlation tables included in the text with the relevant recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice .
I agree with the proposal that a guarantee fund should be set up to ensure the stability of fuel prices in a level playing field for the Community .
My own government has in recent years changed its policy and now actively encourages and assists Irish companies to source in the People &apos; s Republic of China and elsewhere .
I think that they would also like to be informed on this issue - the issue is whether or not to transfer bulk data to the United States ; that is the issue in Amendment 8 .
We could encourage young farmers , who face so much red tape and bureaucracy now .
We are a European Union , totally united .
European solutions are needed .
This will put this category of former Members in the same position as staff with the same length of service .
in writing . - The Conservative Delegation welcomes some aspects of this report , including the endorsement of NATO as the core of European security , and the call for Member States to invest more in defence .
However , I must say that the proposal of the Committee on Budgets to change the Commission proposal will delay delivery of the solidarity fund by about one month because it will have to go back to Council for another vote , but we understand the sensitivity and we cannot argue with the decision of the Committee on Budgets on this matter .
I will respond to the question on behalf of my colleague , Vice @-@ President Anton@@ io Tajani .
We expect that the results of their examin@@ ations will be known in March this year .
Mr Moorhouse &apos; s draft resolution - and I am merely asking to get a resolution that reflects the truth - states that the United Nations Commission &apos; expressed its condemnation &apos; . It did no such thing !
In that connection , due account has to be taken of a host of specific national and regional characteristics .
On the other hand , it takes two to tan@@ go .
We need to strengthen the Growth and Stability Pact , and we fully support the package of Commissioner Olli Rehn .
I will continue to voice my opinions loud and clear .
This is a tight timeframe , but one which can now be achieved because of the strong progress which has been made over the last six months .
We obviously should condemn and demand liberation , impose sanctions and consider suspension but , if we do not go beyond this verbal condemnation and moral support , there will be no fruit from this action .
So , with tobacco being such a big killer , are we really doing enough to help our citizens get rid of this self @-@ destructive habit ?
I want to thank the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy ( ITRE ) , as well as the members of the seven committees that delivered their opinions to ITRE .
In 2007 the number of cases in which an institution or a body actually put an end to maladministration practices as a result of a complaint lodged with the Ombudsman doubled .
The Commission is currently looking at various options on how to better assist the Iraqi refugees in the future .
One is the deputy head of al @-@ Qa &apos; ida in Yemen , and one has blown himself up .
By the way , I gave them very good news because I announced that the Commission is going to put forward initiatives relating to transparency for raw materials - good or bad news depending on perspective : less transparency makes it easier for some regimes to use revenues from their national resources and raw materials in a non @-@ transparent way , sometimes with the compli@@ city , we have to say , of the so @-@ called developed world .
in writing . - I shall be voting in favour of Hel@@ mu@@ t Markov &apos; s report .
It has produced candidates concerning whom I have to say that I have not heard of a single Member of this House who thinks we are now about to appoint the 27 best @-@ qualified men and women in the whole of the European Union to the aw@@ es@@ ome powers concentrated in the hands of the European Commission .
I think the fact that we identified early on that we could not rely on US certification and that we introduced our own testing system proves that we are very serious about this .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , so far we have found agreement on almost all of the package and have demonstrated that codecision is working , with thanks to the hard work of the Hungarian Presidency and of course to An@@ dr@@ ás K@@ ár@@ mán in particular , and to the Parliament negotiating team and the Commission .
We need to stimulate the EU &apos; s market in financial services , while on the other hand ensuring that our consumers make sensible and informed choices , and that all the information and the compar@@ ators are available to them in order to do so .
This is why we rejected them .
The publication of ECB reports on the economic developments of individual euro area Member States , as is suggested in your motion for a resolution , has to be considered against this background .
If too much time is consumed by secondary matters there is less time for crucial issues like enlargement and the partial inability to act .
On the competent body to set thresholds , the Regul@@ atory Committee , provided for in Directive 18 / 2001 / EC , is competent for decisions pertaining to thresholds under Article 21 ( 2 ) of the directive , with regard to exemption from labelling requirements .
Along with those innocent victims fell the values of human conscience , the principles of the United Nations and its duties to protect international peace and security .
As you are all aware , the Commission procedures have delayed the finalisation of this proposal .
I would just like to make sure it is clear that nothing is going to undermine our commitment to reconstruction in Afghanistan .
Although I accept that this has been put in the context of what are called peacekeeping operations , I am still concerned that this is the start of a sli@@ pper@@ y sl@@ ope .
&apos; Conservation of tuna &apos; !
These two countries were the only ones in the Pacific Region to enter into the agreement , as the other members of the Pacific regional grouping - because of their low levels of trade in goods with the EU - chose not to sign .
Madam President , I would like to make three remarks on this excellent report by my colleague .
Madam President , really I just wanted to press home the point to the Commissioner that , given the prev@@ ar@@ ic@@ ation and the delay and the cancellation of last January &apos; s negotiations and the little contact since and the years this has been going on - with one or two meetings a year - are we convinced that there is any real will on the side of the GCC to have an FTA ?
The regulation will also be an important milestone for international cooperation in the area of population and housing cen@@ su@@ ses in which the European Commission , via Eurostat , has been active over many years .
It is this European Union , this Parliament , that are our families &apos; guarantee that the peace and security for which my father has fought and worked in his lifetime will indeed continue for future generations - the solidarity of generations .
We can never accept the use of the death penalty for 29 different offences , for us not one offence .
The third point is that economic and technical cooperation has deepened .
This is an important plank in the freedom to establish services and the completion of the single market .
At the beginning of this session , I wav@@ ed my hands repeatedly for a long time . I may or may not have got on the list , but I had no idea whether or not this was the case .
The EU has gone a long way since St Mal@@ o to af@@ firm its role in security and defence , and NATO in turn has acknowledged the need to broaden its purely military domain by a sof@@ ter dimension and has already taken the decisions .
We do not spend money for the sake of spending money .
We strongly condemn the mass rape and other human rights violations which took place between 30 July and 4 August on at least 500 women and children in North Kivu province by the Democratic For@@ ces for the Liber@@ ation of Rwanda ( F@@ D@@ L@@ R ) , a Hu@@ tu rebel group , and the Ma@@ i Ma@@ i militia , as well as those in other regions of North and South Kivu .
Is it wise for this Parliament to start telling people what to eat , rather than providing them with information of what they are eating ?
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I welcome the number of points and comments that have been made , which underline the importance you attach to the issue of dealing with destructive fishing practices .
These are designed so as to commit budgetary resources to financial institutions such as venture capital funds , national guarantee schemes and commercial banks which would act as intermediaries for final SME beneficiaries .
Is there a policy to deal with such chaos in the mind of the Commission ?
In order to prevent major avian influenza outbreaks , the new legislation would also establish compulsory surveillance and control measures against the low patho@@ genic avian influenza viru@@ ses that can be transmitted to domestic poultry from wild birds , such as duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese .
The natural effect regions will see some hope in the reply you have just given .
There are other areas that we must look at .
Madam President , my point also concerns the Irish referendum .
Mr President , I was delighted to hear the report from the Council on the activities in the European Conference .
It underlines the key sectors of the external assistance policy , as defined in the development policy communication and in the development goals .
The report will be an important point of departure for the international community , which will have to take a position on it .
This is an opportun@@ ist action on behalf of the Socialist Group to try to create a storm before the conference takes place in London .
There is documented evidence of human rights abuses at the sites of T@@ OT@@ AL &apos; s gas pipeline project , including the execution and torture of forced lab@@ ou@@ rers .
It is time - and long overdue - that we look at results around the world that have worked .
I was glad to find such a level of ambition around the table .
I think this debate will contribute to the outcome of the summit to the same extent as all the preparatory work that we carried out with the Commission and which materi@@ alised in the form of those three important workshops in Stockholm , Madrid and Prague .
It must be given the same respect , then we can move forward .
Our aid budget is considerable .
It is not at all clear how an employer is supposed to assess work of equivalent value , whether he is required , for example , to factor in the availability of suit@@ ably qualified applicants .
I said that we do not have a duty to vote , we have a duty to understand what the votes are about .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , as Commissioner Wallström &apos; s research - presented to one of our committees last week - has revealed , there is at least as much a communication crisis in the European Union as a constitutional crisis .
We must take all that into consideration before we move on to further regulation .
Why are they just looking at the industry &apos; s tests and just going back over them ?
If we reopen this debate - a Pand@@ ora &apos; s box - I can guarantee that there would be no agreement at the end of this year .
That involves adapting messages and matching national and local concerns - instead of taking a &apos; one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all &quot; approach - and conve@@ ying them as close to the citizen as possible .
I have to say I find it a truly sick@@ ening sight to see the country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the increasingly appalling International Monetary Fund and its people being told they have to accept this austerity package .
The European Parliament calls on the Malay@@ sian authorities to enact a moratorium on can@@ ing and all other forms of corporal punishment , while working on the aboli@@ shment of this law in letter and in practice .
The fact that two Member States of the European Union possess nuclear weapons undermines the moral authority of the whole of the EU when it comes to the debate on weapons of mass destruction .
I call on the United Kingdom government to offer more assistance to its French counterparts and to the hauliers and businesses concerned , rather than seem@@ ing to turn a blind eye to their concerns and difficulties and spending more time haras@@ sing truck drivers and train operators with prosecutions and fines .
It would do us no harm to re @-@ read the Laeken Declaration , which summed up so po@@ ign@@ antly the problem we face in overcoming the gap between the governed and the govern@@ ors .
However , in the wider context , it is important to say today that despite all the misgivings there are about some of the details of the interinstitutional arrangement and the financial perspective , it is better to have something which is slightly inadequate in the view of some but is nevertheless agreed , than to go forward seeking perfec@@ tion and actually get nothing .
Amendments 1 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 20 , 21 , 22 and 44 imply a significant extension of the scope of the proposal through the introduction of an export ban for cin@@ nab@@ ar ore , cal@@ om@@ el , mercury compounds and some mercury @-@ containing products , as well as through the addition of an import ban .
Signific@@ ant progress has been made so far on the technical preparation of the CCCTB proposal .
That was part of a concerted diplomatic effort and the House will be pleased to have learned that Mr M@@ aw@@ d@@ s@@ ley was released by the Burmese authorities last week .
Open media can be intrusive and the problem with the Internet today is that we have to find a way of dealing with the various segments within which its operations take place .
That is why I welcome Commissioner Kinnock &apos; s statement that the Commission will monitor the transition in all its form@@ ats .
This is just one of the reasons for the growing hostility to the European Union among its citizens .
What does this have to do with justice ?
The problem of brain @-@ drain , insofar as it exists , seems more linked to the salary differential between the country of origin and destination countries than to the quality of the education systems in migrants &quot; countries of origin .
As I said in a letter to the Financial Times this very day , it is a great mis@@ fortune that European Union political leaders , including the UK Prime Minister , Mr Blair , I regret to say , have failed to heed the many warning signals and failed to grasp the ne@@ ttle with the Americans at a much earlier stage .
The net savings on running a vehicle , when fuel prices are at record high@@ s , are greater than any potential increase in the cost of the vehicles - net savings for businesses and lower prices for consumers .
If there is real evidence that the Romanian Security Service has sto@@ ked violence , then that should be subject to scrutiny by the international community .
Personally , I think the name of the Green Climate Fund should be changed , and I think the &apos; Poli@@ tics of En@@ v@@ y Fund &apos; would be better and closer to the truth .
( The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly for the sake of the interpreters )
If there is any impulse which contributes to good research it is the impulse of pure curi@@ osity .
That is why my group will abstain on some of the amendments of substance which would alter the substantive details of the Eurodac regulation .
U@@ sing the European Development Fund monies to complement regional and local authorities &apos; schemes for double g@@ la@@ zing , insul@@ ation and solar panels or for replacing old bo@@ ilers for more energy @-@ efficient ones is an excellent example of how the European Union can help Member States to meet targets which will be of benefit to all European citizens .
So in his quest to gain my full confidence , I hope Mr Tajani , by his good offices , will be doing everything he can to encourage Member States to ensure that this legislation is properly monitored , enforced , and modified if necessary , and that strong action is taken against those who contrav@@ ene this directive .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans do not see any shame in this .
It is our duty and responsibility to reflect on these concerns .
The whole situation as I said is evolving .
Because we have a close relationship with this country , we certainly have to engage in dialogue , but my position is closer to Mr Watson &apos; s thinking : that we need to take a tough hand as well , because if you go &apos; sof@@ tly , sof@@ tly &apos; on a continuous basis , you will get nowhere .
Yesterday I was in L@@ ju@@ bl@@ j@@ ana , Slovenia , together with the current President of the Council , Chancellor Merkel , and many colleagues from the European Council , and I was really moved by the enthusiasm of the Slovenian citizens , who have now joined the euro area .
Some hope of that if we continue to embrace glob@@ alism .
What kind of dignity is that ?
In the Caribbean alone the losses as a result of the cuts are expected to be in the region of EUR 125 million .
Wh@@ ichever way you do it is im@@ material but if we vote &apos; yes &apos; for the first one , we need to vote &apos; yes &apos; for the other two .
Thank you , colleagues , for being active during the last hour .
That is the message that needs to go out .
The documentation coming from these centres is the most necessary element in our attempt to address the problem we are up against and deal with the terrible regimes that carry out torture .
Those undertakings provide for a joint review on their implementation to be conducted by the US authorities and the Commission , the latter assisted by representatives of European law enforcement authorities and data protection supervisors .
In late 2004 , there was one documented case of human @-@ to @-@ human transmission of the &apos; z &quot; strain of H@@ 5@@ N1 .
The agreement will provide us with new possibilities for cooperation on the basis of the guidelines laid down for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 , whether on strengthening the rule of law , judicial reform , tackling poverty or investing in human resources .
So let us be open to scrutiny , for such openness can only increase our own credibility .
&quot; Air traffic delays &quot; is the next one , but of course that is an easy excuse because there is never anyone from air traffic control there to say that is not the issue .
If we look at the euro area , inflation has actually come down from 8 @-@ 10 % in the 1970s and the 8@@ 0s to 3 % in the 1990s and has actually aver@@ aged at a bit over 2 % in the first decade of European Monetary Union .
I expect even more from you , Mr Marín - you know so much about this issue and you have been open to dialogue with Morocco and the Poli@@ s@@ ario Front .
Our century has seen major technological developments in hunting methods which have led to a massive increase in catches , resulting in a corresponding serious decline in global fish stocks .
We feel , once again , that a number of Member States are obe@@ ying what they believe to be the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law .
When can we expect the long @-@ awaited disability directive that will put real legislative weight behind equality for people with disabilities ?
Its response has been to urge European manufacturers to produce higher @-@ value products rather than competing with China on basics , yet China &quot; s ability to cli@@ mb rapidly the value @-@ added lad@@ der across so many sectors shows how unhelpful this advice is .
It is particularly disappointing that in half the Member States there has been a substantial rise in r@@ ental charges for the residential consumer .
Is this not a Union of nations ?
I therefore welcome this report as a means to provide clarity and work@@ ability for business whilst protecting the interests of the millions of people across Europe who depend on rail travel both for work and leisure .
However , we cannot support certain parts of the report .
In the weeks leading up to the discharge vote , this issue became a major issue of confidence - rightly so , in my view .
Mr President , in 1993 in Copenhagen the Union agreed a strategy of ten plus two for enlargement .
Yet when those very same subjects come to this Parliament , you rarely see all the Members from one country voting one way and all the Members of another country voting another way , because we are making political choices - policy choices .
It would require DG Environment and DG Development to work closely together .
The Greens &apos; amendment makes it clear that what they want is codecision on agriculture .
Secondly , when you talk about instruments and compensation measures , can I have the assurance of the Austrian presidency that compensation measures will be forthcoming if , unfortunately , this decision does go ahead ; that these compensation measures will be additional to money in existing or future Community support frameworks ; and that countries will not be forced to po@@ ach money from other parts of their Community support framework .
The consumer decides on price .
This is a clear lesson from the crisis , and prevention is no less important .
It is also the first element of direct democracy .
My Czech colleagues tell me that this has been very good for the qu@@ ails , but disastrous for the human beings who live and work there !
We believe that is too quick , too soon and too much .
We need to note in this respect that it is not a matter of social criteria - putting a question mark over the objective nature of the procurement process - but the very opposite : what matters is to create a level playing field for all those taking part in a procurement procedure .
In our view , if implemented , the Commission &apos; s proposal would allow another Erika to occur .
This year , with Bulgaria and Romania in our Union , we can put to rest the gh@@ o@@ sts of that period .
We also consider that there are many respects in which the report introduces major improvements to the original proposal , and we congratulate Mrs Fraga accordingly .
The only way to deal with that panic is not by not giving information but by explaining what we are doing to deal with this issue .
Mr Santer , could you perhaps , in preparation for the investi@@ ture of the new Commission , draw up a code of conduct as was suggested so that in the future no doubts remain about the composition of the body ?
The general public , the taxpayers of Europe , are looking for the reform which we promised almost three years ago .
Most importantly , I believe we have set the foundations for the service in a way that will engage Parliament properly in the future , and I have already made my commitments to transparency and the approach that I wish to take in working with Parliament .
Something surely , colleagues , must be done .
The objective of the SM@@ A , was supposed to give implementation to the Monti report which had as main concern to re @-@ launch the Single Market .
What discussions is he having with his colleagues in the Development DG of the European Commission ?
The Commission is following this debate closely to ensure the transparency of the decision @-@ making process .
In the proposal on electronic commerce the country of origin is the principal component .
Whilst I certainly endorse Mr Evans &apos; report , the prime concern is speed of consideration .
In my country , some 5@@ 70 illegal wildlife items are seized every day by Her Majesty &apos; s Customs .
The US , the world &apos; s biggest economy , has failed to agree to specific greenhouse gas emission reductions for 2020 , and many other developed industrialised nations are uncertain as to whether the ambitious actions required are possible .
I am quite convinced of that .
By 2020 , it will bring down the average CO2 emissions of vans from the 2007 bas@@ el@@ ine of 203 grams of CO2 per kilometre to 147 grams per kilometre .
I should like to refer to what my friend Mr Casaca said about the appropriation by the European Union of the fish of Greenland .
This package also actually provides for political drivers .
Liberals and Democrats recognise and honour the exceptional personal stamp that Commissioner Bolkestein has placed on that work .
Research and innovation are central to smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , so investment in R &amp; D is the best possible response .
The Commission prefers to leave this issue un@@ harmonised at this stage .
Sport activities also promote social cohesion , democracy and personal development .
These dis@@ mal conditions have been completely reversed in recent years .
I rather suspect , given the very large majority of the House on this issue , that the will of Parliament is rather clear , so I think it is rather the first course of action that will have to be taken .
He now seeks the right , through the referendum , to become President for life .
We cannot have a &apos; do @-@ nothing &apos; attitude , although I note that this phrase has become synonymous with the Conservatives over recent months .
In that event , the Commission will hold consultations with all concerned stakeholders to develop policy and suitable initiatives with a clear EU added value .
We must learn from past failings and ensure that independent investigations are carried out when accidents do occur .
Large sums need to be invested in warning mechanisms , risk maps and public awareness campaigns to ensure our citizens are aware of the risks .
Since it is apparent that peer pressure in the Council does not work , we need binding targets and new transparent means to scrutinise the reports about each Member State .
Firstly , in relation to the scope of Aid for Trade , I want the measurement of the Barroso billion to be against the existing base , which has two categories : one being trade policy and regulation , the other trade development .
The proposed ban would apply only to products tested in the EU and would allow companies to export testing to other parts of the world .
The European Union is however committed to encouraging the progress made towards systematic and progressive efforts towards disarmament .
Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 is , of course , an important tool but , beyond the legal text , it is how we put this into practice that really counts .
My team will therefore give priority to appearing before this Parliament .
We need to be clear about what is currently possible , and on whether risk management controls across the industry are up to scratch , before contemplating further enlargement of the retail fund framework .
At the start of April of this year , the Commission announced the &apos; Debate Europe &apos; initiative . The intention is to broaden further the activities carried out at EU Member State level : consulting citizens , sharing information , knowledge and ideas about the EU , and providing opportunities for voters to meet EU officials .
Mr President , Sinn Féin supports the McCartney family &quot; s demand for those responsible for Robert &quot; s murder to face trial and will continue to do all that it can to help them .
With reference to Article 32 of the framework agreement , our proposal , which is a political decision at this stage , is intended as prior notification to the other institutions and , in line with established practice , the legal act of withdrawal will be taken in three months &apos; time .
We have to work on the assumption - as this is what the evidence shows , contrary to what we thought in the past - that the disease is spread by migratory birds .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - On behalf of the Presidency I would like to stress in a concluding comment that the Presidency is aware of the fact that efficient monitoring of the application of Community law is essential if the law is to be universally respected and if the general legal principles on which the running of the Community is based are to be safeguarded .
We have had discussions about this in the past , and I remember during the min@@ ers &apos; demonstrations those of us who supported the min@@ ers in their struggle against the Thatcher Government were not allowed to display our support and publish post@@ ers .
It is part of the much broader issue of systemic and structural control and audit , which should bring the expected results .
What steps does the Commissioner intend to take to prevent an ex@@ o@@ dus of young people from Europe ?
The Commission will verify that the standards developed comply with the requirements of the directive and the mandates , both when it comes to aspects related to safety and to the participation of consumers , before the publication of the references of the standards in the Official Journal .
in writing . - I voted for this joint resolution because , contrary to the European Commission &apos; s prog@@ no@@ sis on the substantial increase in the prices of dairy products , the dairy market is witnessing a dramatic deterioration , with falling milk prices despite intervention and export subsidies .
I will focus on the two main areas of expenditure : agriculture and cohesion .
There are post@@ ers up all over Benghazi saying so .
We have pressed for a transparent system of payments for travel expenses , an equal salary for MEPs from all countries , and a proper method of direct payments for staff .
I want Ireland to remain at the heart of decision @-@ making in Europe .
The Commission is well aware that the debate on animal testing is a very difficult and sensitive one .
After hearing the concerns of the various Member States , the Commission has presented a possible compromise proposal .
We also welcome the acceptance of the compromise solution of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy regarding energy products .
The question we ask is whether or not the proposals satisfy the requirements : I believe a few of the Commission &apos; s proposals do but the majority fall short .
It is simply saying in the guidelines that written parliamentary questions , just like questions for Question Time , should be within the remit of the institution that is being asked to answer the question . That seems logical and rational , yet it is missing at the moment .
It also consolid@@ ates the EU &apos; s balanced approach to the Arctic , combining its protection and its sustainable development .
Let our overwhelming support for this report be proof to the Turkish people that we do want them in the EU , and let it be a help for greater and faster reforms in Turkey and for enhanced facilitation of solving the far too longstanding Cyprus problem .
We are also very conscious that the preservation of digital material will be one of the essential questions of the future , and I am therefore glad that the Council has endorsed the Commission approach to the European digital library and that Parliament is now helping us move in the same direction and is putting its political weight behind this objective .
The agreement is intended to contribute to the fight against smuggling and fraud .
The wish of the committee is that we should reassess this issue .
To continue to lift people out of pockets of poverty , India &quot; s trade reforms must complement development policies .
We will strive to achieve a balanced approach , but that does not mean back@@ tracking ; that is clearly not the way we would like to present it .
Mr President of the Council , my group could put more payments on the line if we were certain that policies were being better managed .
I am concerned that the WTO may be pushing for trade without due concern to animal health and human health implications .
I am afraid this is the case in Congo .
I should have listened to the original answer rather than the interpretation but I did not understand where the documentary sources for the rules governing the URBAN programme can be found .
A lot of research has been carried out in Ireland on the merits or de@@ merits of st@@ aging posts in general , and studies by leading agricultural research institutes have shown that it is better for animal welfare on long journeys between Ireland and the continent that st@@ aging posts remain .
I could cite many more instances and I have tabled a number of amendments for my group to deal with some of the difficulties .
Secondly , regarding the point on protectionism on the TEC , it is quite clear that the biggest danger in the next 12 months is closing markets rather than opening ones , and yet we have the transatlantic market which is , as Mr Brok said , the biggest opportunity we have for generating growth on both sides of the Atlantic .
In the case of Sri Lanka , the Commission &apos; s attention was drawn to publicly available reports and statements from the United Nations as well as to other relevant sources , including non @-@ governmental organisations , indicating that Sri Lanka was not effectively implementing various human rights conventions , in particular , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the Convention Against Torture and Other Cru@@ el , In@@ human or De@@ grading Tre@@ at@@ ment or Pun@@ ishment , and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
I voted against the Maat report because it does not do enough to protect the welfare of animals .
I would like to thank the Ombudsman , Mr Diamandouros , for his comments here today , particularly in relation to the report .
The London Bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ s of H@@ oun@@ slow , E@@ aling and R@@ ich@@ mond have all benefited at some time and I am very pleased about that .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report since the Gener@@ alised System of P@@ references ( GSP ) is a highly important trade and development mechanism that the EU has at hand .
The upcoming CAP reform will have to take into account many issues , including climate change .
We should be having a summit of Prime Ministers to look at not only EU competence but also exchanges of best practice on management of migration as well as integration .
Madam President , I welcome the announcement of this most important package and look forward to the legislative debate that will follow .
You tell us in this place what age we may recruit at ; you tell us what colour they may be ; you tell us how much leave they must have ; you tell us how much their pensions will be .
There were some comments on the shortcomings of our presidency , and I shall take these in the spirit in which they were made .
What I did not expect , and what I did not know , was that , whilst they were urging our group not to table any amendments , they were actually urging the Socialists to table amendments .
Most certainly I do .
We need our own peacekeepers in there and we cannot rely on the United Nations .
What can we do to save our own system ?
For humanitarian reasons , for political reasons and for economic reasons , opening up and creating a normal flow is absolutely essential .
Secondly , we would agree to avoid a legal vacuum .
However , do not forget that the Luxembourg process is still very new .
The Commission remains open to proposals for action from all actors .
But I wish to state that it is very unwise to selec@@ tively highlight any one issue which is already covered quite comprehensively in the agreement .
The European Union &apos; s relationship with both the African Union and the Southern African Development Community has been damaged by African states &apos; insistence that banned Zimbabwe@@ ans should be included in meetings in Europe .
It is not the business of this directive to take satisfactory equipment off the market without any basis for doing so .
. As Parliament knows , the European Union process to review the capital requirements rules is taking place in parallel with the review of the international rules being carried out by the Basel Committee on Ban@@ king Super@@ vision .
The European Union is providing a range of instruments to help the authorities carry out the necessary reforms .
Second , last year &apos; s defer@@ ral for further consideration of the draft UN norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations must genuinely lead to action this year which will ensure that companies observe human rights obligations .
It is ironic that our next debate is on Zimbabwe .
I wish that was a universal characteristic , but I find that some people writing in the press , for instance , have a confidence and an asser@@ tiveness in what they write , which is in inver@@ se proportion to the amount of knowledge that they have .
The Presidency was encouraged by Ma@@ x @-@ Peter R@@ atz@@ el , the new director of Europol &apos; s positive meeting with the European Parliament &apos; s Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs back in June .
On the contrary , I said we fully understood those reasons , and that she has our every sympathy .
Mr President , the experience of many ages te@@ aches us that paper rights on their own are no adequate guarant@@ ors of civic freedoms .
NATO is a key strategic partner for the European Union .
I have no doubt this move is directly related to the President of the Commission &apos; s call for the development of a &apos; Europe of the regions &apos; .
Father Pere@@ ira asked Professor Sar@@ ab@@ hai to come to church on Sunday morning at 9 a.m. and he turned up on Sunday with his team .
Having said this , the European Central Bank &apos; s credibility relies on the absolute determination of the euro area governments to do whatever it takes to ensure the financial stability of the euro area , so I have no doubts about the system &apos; s ability , of the efforts in the euro area and the credibility of the European Central Bank .
We are renewing our agreement with the principle of freedom of movement of services and facilitating it , but we are agreeing that social rights come first .
This is not the time for long speeches , Mr President , but you deserve your victory .
For ten years Kosovo has bec@@ k@@ oned us .
Trafficking in human beings is a serious international crime that no one government can tackle single @-@ han@@ dedly .
Mr President , in all my time on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , this is the first time that I can recall that one of our major directives has received such prominence in the Parliamentary agenda .
Our Union , while mindful of the geo@@ politics , must understand the politics of Moldova , a people keen to exercise democracy and freedom of choice , a country trading overwhelmingly with the countries to its west , a land linked to Member States of the Union through geography , history and culture .
For this to happen to them as well , I have no doubt , brings back many terrible mem@@ ories .
For gas it is Russia which today provides 27@@ .5 % of our supplies .
National parliaments are given six months to decide what they may do .
We need Europe to be strong in mind , fleet of foot and united in purpose over the weeks and months ahead , ready to strip out the toxic assets that are crippling bank balances , ready to reform bank practice to restore credi@@ t@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , and ready to accept that the current stimulus package may not be enough , because it is no good to@@ pping up the IMF if there is no global financial system to support , and while it is rough justice that responsible Member States must mitigate against default by those who lived it up , that may be the price to pay to avoid the contagi@@ on of economic mel@@ t@@ down .
On the information campaign you asked for in Amendments 1 , 2 , 16 , 17 and 22 , it is not the kind of measure that fits into this proposal .
Finally , this is not the best hour of the day to disagree with Mrs Buitenweg or Mrs McKenna about the European arrest warrant .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Lamy for his interesting and helpful remarks this afternoon and to reiterate on behalf of the ELDR Group our gratitude to him and his staff for the close cooperation which we successfully established in Seattle .
As a newly elected MEP I too have difficulties with this Institution , so I share the problems that the citizens have .
It should rather be a comprehensive framework where guidance can be found for all European Union activities in the region .
That said , I would like to underline three points .
The common text we have before us is united in making sure that Saddam Hussein is clearly identified as being in the wrong ; that there has to be implementation of UN resolutions .
Peace in the Middle East requires a comprehensive solution .
I know this is a scenario that the Commissioner will be keen to avoid .
Unfortunately , instead of replacing that mono@@ li@@ th by going on to genuine democratic soci@@ alism , it was the restoration of capitalism which followed .
It seeks a fresh bre@@ e@@ ze to lift its sa@@ ils .
I see there are still many limitations and colleagues underlined the problems in Tajikistan in terms of human rights , poverty and so on , but I believe this agreement is Europe at its best and I am very much in favour of it .
As we indicated in our communication , these are not new tools or instruments . They are outlined extensively in both the CMO and in the EFF .
There are a number of conditions precedent to any serious discussion of visas .
That is the price el@@ as@@ tici@@ ty of demand .
This initiative , draws together a high @-@ level , round table advisory group made up of primary producers , food processors , retailers and consumers .
Given the fact that they murdered nine activists on the flo@@ tilla last year , these threats have to be taken extremely seriously .
Yet four years later , not a single developing country has proved able to do this .
In effect we will be saying that languages spoken by a few hundred people in some cases , and I agree with the support of those languages , are more important to the EU than others spoken by hundreds of thousands .
It is absurd to claim that US peacekeepers would run the ga@@ unt@@ let of anti @-@ American prejudice .
Let me say why .
Developing countries have realised that there is strength in numbers and power in using that strength .
The recent energy crisis demonstrated all too clearly the extent to which we need to increase our ability to resist future supply problems , as we could see earlier this year .
in writing . The Irish members of the Fine Gael delegation voted in favour of the report as a whole , as we support the general thrust of the report and its strong stance against the process of extraordinary rendition and the involvement of EU countries or airports in that process .
I think that before Mr Dupuis gets so exci@@ ted and starts making such exaggerated accusations he should first verify what has actually happened .
For us as a small country , getting to 0.7 per cent is the small matter of EUR 1.5 billion !
For me , politics is about changing things : about helping people shape their own lives .
That is why I welcome the Belgian Government &apos; s initiative for a meeting later this month with France , Germany and Luxembourg , on defence policy .
China comes into this report ; we know of serious cases of political and religious persecution there .
I believe the Internet has enhanced Europeans &apos; lives in countless ways .
The agreement will show our support for progress .
That is why the Commission follows all these issues closely as part of its regular monitoring .
The surprise result definitely s@@ cot@@ ched all the allegations that the election would be stolen by che@@ ating by the authorities .
We are , of course , using full transparency .
Madam President , we all support human rights , and I am growing a little tired of some people - particularly those from states where , historically speaking , human rights are something of a no@@ vel@@ ty - attacking the UK as some sort of pari@@ ah because of its &apos; gesture &apos; opt @-@ out under Protocol 7 .
Mr President , I wish to begin by saying a few words about humanitarian assistance to this region .
The Commission wants to review this within three years of operation , even though if we agree that it is inappropriate for the authority to charge fees at present .
Unfortunately not all of them were able to persuade their groups to follow the line .
I welcome the Presidency &apos; s emphasis on concrete operational outcomes from the conference , because our citizens want to see very concrete results .
Furthermore , I want to know how the Commission responds to questions that , I think , we in the Parliament have to ask , for instance on budget support to a country like Haiti , which has been recognised by Transparency International as the most corrupt country in the world .
Is this the Pau@@ line Green who , in December , recommended that we vote confidence without even thinking ?
Already today there are about 120 different police forces in the European Union , most of them , I may say , in my own Member State , because in the United Kingdom we have a police force in every single county and they only work up to their county borders .
A public register of documents has been up and running since 3 June 2002 , as required by Regulation 1049 / 2001 .
I cannot see that regulations framed in this way benefit anybody .
Mr President , in order to avoid confusion , I should just like to clarify our request for a split vote and an oral amendment to Amendment 3 .
It is a strategic bridge connecting Europe with the Caspian Sea and Central Asia .
Have a look tomorrow and on Wednesday and Thursday at the absolutely far@@ ci@@ cal voting system here and realise that whatever Mr Barroso said last week about deregulation , less regulation and the six@@ ty legislative acts they intend to withdraw , there have been some 2 000 legislative instruments passed in the short period since 1 July , when the British took over the Presidency of the Council .
The Commission will continue to use all the means at its disposal to pursue effective protection of human rights in Azerbaijan and to make sure that the democratisation of the country progres@@ ses smoothly in the near future .
The European Parliament must do what it can to aver@@ t this catastrophe .
T@@ est them long and test them hard , or you too will have your goodwill exploited .
I look forward to the reports and the investigations that have been highlighted in this report - at the last count , 11 reports , six investigations into different fields and the re @-@ establishment of DG Competition &apos; s fiscal State aid unit .
Now the Greens are talented politicians - and I say this in admiration .
I am very pleased that he has actually ensured that the final piece of the TENs jig@@ saw has been put in its rightful place .
The agreement at the summit on the draft revision of the Treaties was a major breakthrough and a special word of thanks is owed to those involved , in particular the government representative No@@ el Dor@@ r , for the leading role he played in this respect .
It is important that we give financial support to Northern Cyprus , but that must be through the recognised democratic Government of the Republic of Cyprus .
We will take into account the conclusions , the outcome and the atmosphere of this debate , as Parliament &quot; s line in this state aid report is of key importance .
Now let me turn to the subject of our debate today .
In this case , when it comes to empowering human rights &apos; defenders , red tape is absolutely necessary and , I would say , brilliant .
Regarding Amendments 9 and 11 relating to the harmonisation of sanctions and the possible closure of a national fishery of a Member State where it fails to respect its reporting requirements , let me say that , whereas we fully understand and share the spirit behind this proposal , we cannot accept the amendment in this context , as the proposal does not include measures that address the issue . The issue is one of general policy and the Commission will examine it in the forthcoming 2008 reform of the control framework of the common fisheries policy .
The number has grown enormously .
These rules would be imposed across the European Union , removing the flexibility for national governments to respond with different policies in the future .
They are supporting a bill that would impose the death penalty , or life imprisonment , on homosexuals , depending on the nature of their so @-@ called crime .
For example , one of the paragraphs which has been weakened from the original draft emphasised the need for enhanced appropriate levels of transparency towards the public , investors and supervisory authorities , including , in the future , any new EU supervisory body .
It is a life and death issue for the peripheral areas , but I know it is not a life and death issue for those coming from the middle .
On 18 April 2007 , we obtained our first interim order in relation to an infrastructural project .
Ladies and gentlemen , whilst we are holding a plenary session at the start of the New Year here , people are once again dying in the Middle East .
The rapporteur &apos; s answer is for the Community to be given the resources , effectively , to take direct control over fisheries monitoring .
We cannot accept restrictions on the importation of ruminant products due to a TSE risk , as such restrictions are laid down by the TSE regulation .
It is imperative that the promotion of sustainable fisheries and the needs of fisheries @-@ dependent communities are kept to the fore .
I want to point out that they have no dispute at this time with the Parliament as their employer .
While I am grateful for your support for the Commission &apos; s role and the re @-@ institution of an advisory committee , this is a lost fight with the Council .
So , just on this last ground , all the women fleeing from there should be given asylum .
This is why the microphone was switched off .
In its amended proposal the Commission , after the first reading , accepted in full or in part 12 of the 17 amendments tabled by Parliament .
I agree with my Cypriot colleague , Mr Kas@@ ou@@ lides , that an interesting situation is also arising on the Israeli side .
They also show no understanding of the needs of the industry , or its employees .
It must dam@@ pen the fires of the increasingly bitter disputes we have witnessed in recent weeks .
In order that co @-@ operation is as close as possible , there must be an exchange of personal data of those few who pose a threat to security .
Unless the Commission assidu@@ ously ensures the application and enforcement of social laws , social Europe will fall into total disrepute , and citizens will quite rightly turn their backs on the EU .
More shoc@@ k@@ ingly still , a UK charity , Christian Aid , maintains that around EUR 7 trillion is hidden away in tax havens .
Mr President , I intend to verify carefully whether this scheme can be used in this case and you will certainly understand that I cannot take a position at this stage since the deal is not yet finalised and , by the way , a number of aspects are still being negotiated .
I think it is not just a fi@@ g le@@ af .
But the inclusion of Annex XV in the Accession Treaty means that voting for enlargement endorses its inclusion .
This amendment means that all fishing vessels would have to have CC@@ TV .
But the IGC is , of course , conducted at political level , and I will be asking Foreign Ministers to take forward work on a range of issues during the final negotiations at the level of Heads of State or Government .
Any proposal that she would put before this House would have my full support and confidence because I trust entirely her integrity in these matters .
Finally , as has been said by Mrs Ewing , Chernobyl is not a unique plant .
We must not hesitate , either , to make it clear that unity and integrity should apply equally for Georgia and for Russia .
Madam President , the main reasons for food inflation have been rising global commodity prices , so@@ aring energy prices and volatility within the marketplace , and there is no doubt that the consumer is suffering .
On traffic data retention , discussions have been particularly difficult .
I know that she feels strongly about this and that she is not alone in that .
If this House does not give assent to the general regulation , there can be no agreement for the regulations that follow on from it .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , the rapporteur accepts that government finances in several euro zone countries are still not in good shape .
Mr President , the Customs Union is a wonderful thing but it would be even more wonderful if it was adhered to by all countries concerned .
If we are serious about democracy in the Union , if we are serious about a Union that cares , we certainly have to ensure that full information on policy initiatives and direction are given to the people .
We can only do 20 % if the 100 % of the total amount of energy use is something that is reduced rather than being allowed to increase .
. Mr President , I congratulate Mr De Rossa on his report , as well as the Ombudsman .
It is contrary to the principles of the single market and , in my view , is de facto a form of censorship , and artificially ration@@ ing the supply of books in favour of the better @-@ off .
I understand that the author of the mem@@ o referred to , Mr Mu@@ is , is due to attend the Committee on Budgetary Control meeting this week and I suggest that members of that committee ask him whether he would write the same kind of mem@@ o today as he wrote in May of last year .
We could support them in another report dealing with those escaping from hunger or environmental disasters .
On 19 February the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , under the chairmanship of Mr C@@ aver@@ i , organised a public hearing on the future of European tourism , which was attended by the Commission and the Council .
No one is forced to buy these products and those that do buy them tend to be well informed about their purchases .
However , whatever the consequences for existing EU members , the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must view current developments with growing alarm .
But other actions are possible , such as the more general extension of health and safety legislation to the self @-@ employed suggested in Mr Pérez Álvarez &apos; s Amendment No 4 .
Much as we wish to help increase the profits of our fishermen , it is our primary concern and duty to prevent the extinction of any shark species .
Our work with civil society to engage the people of this world for a strong treaty is essential .
They have no identity .
These worries I wanted to share with you .
Many of my constituents cannot get access to broadband and students are deprived of the technology when they go home .
I would even add that , thirdly , it is very important that neighbouring countries also contribute to more unity in the country and less conflict .
As the European Council stated in its conclusions , the priority of ensuring the safety of nuclear plants obviously cannot cease to apply at our borders .
We should move from government @-@ related or oriented policy towards society @-@ oriented policy , and from short @-@ sighted economic interest policy towards human rights and democracy @-@ oriented policy .
The proposed deletion of the indicative amounts for tobacco products and alcohol constitutes only one of the elements of the relevant Commission proposal amending the arrangements for products subject to excise duty .
This is why we are working to get the budget lines for those issues , but we have to explain better to European citizens why these projects are needed .
That is such a far cry from the Common Market which the United Kingdom joined in 1973 .
We need full alignment between the ESF and Europe 2020 as it will be a major instrument for implementing the integrated guidelines .
I only have five minutes and I could speak at length about the Northern Caucasus , Georgia , Abkhazia , South Ossetia and also on Nagorno @-@ Karabakh and Moldova , so please do not take it that we did not know .
There has also been a great deal of upheav@@ al and restructuring and some evidence of the formation of new monopolies , something which must be comb@@ ated .
Firstly , while people must be punished if they have committed a crime , it is essential that while they are awaiting trial in another Member State accused persons should not find themselves in a more difficult situation than if they were in their own country .
We said that he would really be opening the way for radical Islam@@ ism if he did not allow the political opposition any breathing space .
At the same time it is very clear that there are differences between different member countries , because there are different sourcing strategies for the companies concerned .
Mr G@@ ere@@ me@@ k has signed such declarations in the past .
As I have said many times in this Chamber , under the European Arrest Warrant , extradition - or rather judicial surrender , to use the correct term - is now merely a bureaucratic form@@ ality .
Moreover , the Presidency has decided to organise the Employment Summit so as to maintain a platform for the debate and eventual decisions , and that will be held on 7 May .
This will be done by the Member States and also Member States will decide , for example , where this will be located .
The impact of sugar labelling or of denying win@@ eries from using sugar additives would have had a prohibi@@ tive effect on wine production in northern Europe .
What we have been doing - and what we can do - is to have a human rights dialogue , as I said .
Does the Commission agree that there must be total transparency from now on and that such practices should not be repeated even if loyalty is at stake ?
This necessit@@ ates an end to Israel &apos; s siege of Gaza and settlement policy , combined Palestinian commitment to non @-@ violence and its State building programme along with mutual respect for the 1967 borders .
Both Syria and Lebanon have an important role to play .
Our thoughts and pr@@ ay@@ ers are with his family at this time .
As I said at the outset , we cannot adopt measures which would effectively ban a trade , particularly in circumstances where there is insufficient scientific information to support such a move .
Well , I am guilty because I still do it .
It is sometimes forgotten that although the main justification for research is to become more competitive at international level , even in the current Treaty we are told that we must promote all the research activities deemed necessary by the other chapters .
Consumers will thus be informed of the actual price ( price of ticket plus the various charges and taxes ) . &apos;
They should be here to vote !
We have no difficulty with the debate on the Dan@@ k@@ ert report beginning at 9 o &apos; clock , provided we can be assured that the senior members of the administration , from the Secretary @-@ General down@@ wards , are here for the discharge debate on Parliament &apos; s budget .
Mr President , the proposed Constitution was approved by 500 votes to 137 , and confirmed by 3@@ 82 to 125 votes ; so the opponents now have one in four votes in this House , but when we are represented at meetings abroad with the national parliaments , it is only 1 to 14 .
Growth is worse .
The precautionary principle is something that we must adhere to within the European Union and it must be respected at all times .
It protects the welfare of the h@@ en ; it is profitable and it is popular .
We must work together to reduce exposure to the disease .
My service and Mr Verheugen &apos; s service , which , of course , is the lead service for enlargement , are in discussion on this , not only on issues relating to public health , but also protection of consumers .
With more and more countries queu@@ ing up to join the EU , I am worried that Wales will see much @-@ needed support go to newer member countries .
We will have done our work in terms of contributing ideas and proposals to the Convention and that in itself is very important .
If the European Union is to become a community of values - if we are to play a true role in the new global governance , then we need to be promoting the values of the Geneva Conventions not only to our own soldiers and security forces , but also to people in our civilian societies .
We are being accused of all sorts of outrageous things , and we are entitled to proper conduct and ethical behaviour by our colleagues here in this House , and indeed outside the House .
All these actions reflect the importance that the Commission attaches to the vaccination .
As a democratic institution one has to say that it is nothing more than a sham .
In other words we know what is going on , we have seen it before .
Ensuring that prior consent is given from third countries receiving dangerous substances helps ensure that developing countries do not fall victim to the dumping of restricted chemicals in their back@@ yard without their agreement .
It certainly is .
This line has been allowed to run down into poor condition ; its safety is questionable and the rolling stock is a disgrace .
BSE has been an expensive lesson for Europe and one that cannot ever be repeated .
The Commission is pursuing a twin @-@ track approach .
I did the same for the other amendments to this paragraph .
We continue to be very active in providing support to projects in social sectors and in the field of democratisation , respect for human rights and the rule of law .
From listening to the debate , there is almost total agreement on what we need to do when it comes to children &apos; s rights , and we have come a long way from the old ad@@ age that &apos; children should be seen and not heard &apos; .
Let us not play on the hopes and fears of sufferers .
We should continue to help countries which find it hard to meet their counter @-@ terrorism obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 13@@ 73 .
The contributions will be reflected in the follow @-@ up report later this year , as requested in the Wynn report .
We must ensure first of all that people - the consumers - know where the produce came from .
Unfortunately , the Treaty in Article 79 refers to &apos; illegal &apos; so that is why it is in there , but I myself also always use the term &apos; irregular &apos; migration , so I fully agree with you .
I think that this is one of the main challenges in Cancún : whoever speaks on behalf of the European Union , our partners outside Europe can be sure that they will be met with the same kind of priorities and the same kind of messages .
When I appeared before you during my hearing , I assured you that I would promote health issues and , above all , consumer safety .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would really like to thank Parliament for putting this very important item on the agenda .
They are not speculative metals .
When we have a new financial perspective - who knows - it may even be in line with the AB@@ B format of budgeting .
It is the &apos; water &apos; flowing in the pi@@ pes of the Internet .
Madam President , it is a pleasure to see you back in the chair .
The Commission does not have the power to authorise any practices that are contrary to the Treaty .
It is to be hoped that the Commission takes heed of today &apos; s call from this institution .
There are many computer scientists struggling with totally inadequate facilities who would really like to be on our research networks and working with our research scientists .
This can only happen if , in Europe as a whole , we pass the same moral and political verdict on totalitarian Communism as was passed on Naz@@ ism .
Another point that pic@@ ks up what Mr Poettering said and which nobody else has spoken of is that a European democracy must be a democracy at many levels .
Any proposals to undermine the moratorium on field testing and marketing of these suicide seeds must be firmly rejected , and that is what our group has tabled an amendment on tomorrow to strengthen that point .
Has he ever seen an auction market ?
Mr President , monopolies are not acceptable , whether state or otherwise , and we must be careful with the single market not to create new private monopolies in the energy sector .
I will not relaunch that debate , but anyone looking at this splendid Chamber and the pal@@ ati@@ al public spaces of this building would not believe the cr@@ am@@ ped conditions in which a back@@ ben@@ ch MEP works .
Madam President , this is the time when we show solidarity and sympathy to China .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you to the Members for a very serious and substantive debate reflecting the serious situation we are now facing in Europe .
It is why we are working closely with Member States so that they bring additional money in the context of the newly @-@ adopted EU aid @-@ for @-@ trade strategy .
The EU cohesion policy , through the European Social Fund , will continue to co@@ finance initiatives at national and local level .
We are conscious of the delicate sensitivities and prerogatives surrounding these questions , but our bottom line is clear .
Although I cannot comment on specific sectors and their management , it is true that we cannot blame the macroeconomic environment alone .
It is much more difficult to counterfeit coins .
The Regulation 1@@ 107 / 70 , as amended in 1992 , sets out the mechanism for aid for combined transport for last year and this year so it is indeed timely that , in the month of February , we are nonetheless looking at this extension of the regulation .
Support for independent media and information dissemination is among the key priorities of EU assistance .
I welcome in overall the call for greater transparency and involvement of European Parliament and national parliaments .
Only then can these products move out of the nic@@ he market they already have and into the mainstream .
There is no hierarchy of oppression .
I warmly thank Mrs Car@@ ril@@ ho , my friend and colleague .
Amendments Nos 26 and 28 to 13 ( 5 ) therefore seemed rather confused - one seeking less and one seeking more detailed information for consumers .
I would like to thank the three rapporteurs , Mrs Klaß , Mrs Ayuso González and Mr Olsson , and the members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , for their hard work on these legislative dossiers .
The same one that often leads people to kill each other and , sometimes , even causes whole nations to fight one another .
I will now give the floor to Mr Fo@@ x , who is against this proposal .
We are still concerned about the ongoing fighting .
European governments have a responsibility to show leadership in the area of racism and xenophobia and politicians and civic leaders are failing to address the issue of racism in their own communities .
I am also exci@@ ted , particularly as a British citizen , that the new government in Ju@@ ba is committed to recognising the independence of the Republic of Somaliland - the former British Prot@@ ect@@ orate of Somaliland - and I am convinced also that many other African and European states will shortly follow thereafter .
Concerning open access to new technology and new investments in broadband , the honourable Member knows perfectly well that the Commission has veto@@ ed the proposal by the German Government to establish a new monopoly on fibre .
Madam President , Turkey holds elections but is not a democracy in the accepted Western sense .
Member States spent billions of euro on vaccines , which were authorised in a rush despite the moderate nature of the virus .
Working nine to five is not an option for all .
For example , on the environment , we find that environmental impact assessments do not apply to projects which were planned before the legislation was implemented .
It is very important for Asia and Europe to deepen mutual understanding and cooperate further , not only for the development and prosperity of the two regions but also for the peace and prosperity of the world .
However , I can assure her that she is correct in her analysis , in recognising that one of the main outstanding issues is how to apply the directive : per contract or per worker .
Pro@@ jects of this nature are foreseen neither in the communication of May 2001 on the European Union &apos; s role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries , nor in the 2002 @-@ 2004 programming document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights .
But I do wonder whether the people of Lin@@ col@@ n@@ shire would view this as a good use of money .
We quite understand that the public has to have priority - it is their building too .
The United States &quot; un@@ readiness to engage stopped developing countries from making any move or showing any flexibility of their own .
I can , however , accept the one other new amendment by Mrs Thyssen , whose report we are also discussing and who has played a very constructive part in these debates .
No rights are more important than those against discrimination and those in favour of freedom of movement .
This proposal is very important - it is essential for the safe collection , transport , storage , handling , processing and disposal of the millions of tonnes of animal by @-@ products produced in the Union every year .
Member States are very often accused , even by the Commission , of ignoring the science in their determination to defend their national interest in the Council .
How does the Commission evaluate the dangers to the EU as a single economic area from the fact that Member States such as Great Britain and Sweden have still not introduced the euro as their currency and what measures and initiatives are being planned for the new term of office of the Commission in this sector ?
The translation is wrong .
Economic reforms in the 1990s have recorded significant achievements with GDP , on average , rising to 4.@@ 8 % during the 1994 @-@ 1999 period .
Thirdly , we are proud of our S@@ ami EU citizens , and we are proud of the different provisions in the EU treaties and in the EU regional policy addressing the S@@ ami people .
Mr President , two days ago a four @-@ year @-@ old girl was killed in my constituency after being hit by a car in front of her mother .
The establishment of a mechanism for the creation and deployment of Rapid Border Inter@@ vention Te@@ ams is a further measure of solidarity .
We all know that the beef sector has come through a very difficult period , but many serious problems remain for farmers .
However , the specific details of specific programmes are obviously cont@@ ingent on the resolution of that matter .
Mr President , is Mr Díaz de Mera aware that a fast @-@ track extradition treaty was signed between the UK and Spain in 2003 , long before the European Arrest Warrant , and would the speaker perhaps consider that this is a better blueprint for dealing with serious crime , rather than the European Arrest Warrant with all the problems of which we are now hearing ?
This is a matter which should be resolved with great urgency by the Chinese authorities before its consequences spiral out of control .
This is why the Council should take particular notice of the European Parliament &quot; s report on climate change , which has been exper@@ tly drafted by An@@ ders Wijkman .

The tragedy is that 18 months on , bombings , attacks and rap@@ es are still taking place , despite the best efforts of the African Union both in the Abuja peace talks and on the ground in Darfur .
I would not call this a subsidy from the European Union , but rather support for European cooperation , because we put together monies and distribute them in line with agreed rules , and these rules should lead us to excellence , the transfer of knowledge , and the rewarding or promotion of quality , not just quantity , in our academic institutions .
The end of your presidency will be marked by the election of 5@@ 32 new MEPs .
I hope that if the honourable Member thinks we have not done so adequately , she will let us know .
The presidency will be surprised to hear me say that I recognize the difficulties it has in this most sensitive area of national sovereignty .
Mr Brok , could you have your discussion outside of the Chamber , please ?
That is false , and this particular case in Afghanistan shows it to be so .
The campaign has been marked by Ale@@ k@@ san@@ d@@ r Ko@@ zu@@ lin , a presidential candidate , being heavily beaten by secret service men .
Israel is not a normal country because many of the present government &apos; s actions are completely unacceptable : building a fence , occupying territory , breaching human rights , using repression .
Of course , we have a choice , and I know the temptation for some is to meet this new insecurity by re@@ treating - to try to feel safe by attempting to pull up the draw@@ bridge and to turn the clock back .
The Council , the Commission and Parliament should facilitate the use of un@@ spent funds in our budget for relief .
Firstly , the April Justice and Home Affairs Council will discuss it on 12 April .
The Commission will specifically ensure that this programme is a relevant tool to channel the synergies of public authorities and NGOs in order to preserve the physical and psychological integrity and the social well @-@ being of children , young persons and women in all areas of activity .

This started this morning at 0@@ 8@@ .00 , through Eurocontrol .
GMOs are an issue that has been raised already .
I wonder whether those who have been making repeated remarks in successive votes in successive plenary part @-@ sessions on this issue do not have a political motive behind them .

It was an honour for my party to be given the rapport@@ eur@@ ship .
But now we must do something about the fishermen .
Secondly , the directive proposes to com@@ pile a top ten list of vehicles according to class .
The global fight against terrorism on an unprecedented scale has created new challenges for the protection of human rights .
Some of the rapporteur &apos; s conclusions are very disturbing .
People such as Mr Davies have said : &apos; well , we have not done this for alcohol &apos; .
Of course , such action needs to be evidence @-@ based .
However , global politics should not be used as an excuse for our own double standards .
However , the report was decisive in its conclusions regarding the loss of control of management by this European Commission ; and it was right and proper that in the light of the conclusions the College took the decision to resign .
I would like you to rule that none of these amendments are admissible because at 10.@@ 45 a.m. this morning when we last checked , there was no voting list on the electronic system .
We strongly condemn recent violence .
However , I would ask him to go further .
We in the EU put a lot on the table in the interests of developing countries in the area of agriculture , market access and so on .
Prime Minister Cameron and President Sarkozy have made and pushed through decisions - not the EU representatives .
In fact , by answering your question which I just did , I am sure that we can now provide facts which will correct these misunderstandings in the media which were referred to by Mr C@@ la@@ e@@ ys .
That is exactly what we expect from the new Commission .
Now we know that this app@@ all@@ ingly modest target will not even be met until 2030 .
That is the first thing to do , but things are not that far advanced , I think .
This split does not provide value for money to EU taxpayers , nor does it serve our foreign policy interests .
I generally , though , reject State funding directly for SMEs as the State is generally poor at picking winners amongst competing demands for capital .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank the Honourable Member , Mr Ó Neachtain , for his question , which gives me the opportunity to address the issue of the decommissioning of fishing vessels .
N@@ euro@@ degener@@ ative diseases such as Alzheimer &apos; s and Parkinson &apos; s disease affect more than seven million citizens of the European Union .
I agree with the rapporteur on this , and I think we are in danger here of going too far too soon .
In addition , this directive is also meant to improve the environment and congestion and again I would refute that claim .
It was principally a platform for the left to attack their favourite b@@ ête no@@ ire , the United States .
You are not going to tell us at the end of the Belgian presidency : I am so sorry it sli@@ pped ; somebody got it in the way !
These proposals are the latest in a long series of dairy @-@ oriented measures that we have adopted .
This is important not only as regards Chechnya , but also for many other places .
In paragraph 47 , carbon @-@ capture is experimental but it is promising , and in paragraph 47 we call on the Commission to lay down , as soon as possible , clear political guidelines for the promotion of research into carbon capture and storage .
I very much support this regulation .
The current situation not only har@@ ms the cod stocks in the Baltic but is also threatening the fishing sector reliant on this resource .
But the situation at S@@ ang@@ at@@ te cannot be allowed to f@@ ester .
I met with the F@@ le@@ et@@ wood Fish Produc@@ ers &apos; Association recently .
We need it more than the larger states .
We do not need new competences , but we want to exercise the powers we already have under the Treaty more effectively and I have every sympathy for the European Parliament &apos; s desire to do the same .
We have a situation within the United Kingdom - and , for that matter , Europe - over fi@@ b@@ reg@@ l@@ ass , which has an import duty at the moment of ( and I stand to be corrected on this ) 4@@ 3.@@ 6 % .
in writing . - I voted against this resolution , which states the position of the European Parliament ahead of the initi@@ alling of the Anti @-@ Coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ iting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , because the conservative majority in this House refused to raise the need for basic safeguards for our citizens vis @-@ à @-@ vis this global copyright agreement .
The Lisbon Council promised to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge @-@ based economy in the world .
I have listened carefully to all of you , to your kind words and to your calls to step up our work .
Unfortunately , this report tells us that privatisation of the postal sector so far has delivered fewer but , more critically , worse jobs with poorer working conditions .
The minimal use of Irish in this Chamber is self @-@ evident , although Miss de Brún , as part of her aggressive Republican agenda , may reg@@ ale us in that dead tongue , with the only relief being that hardly anyone who tun@@ es into Parliament on line can understand a word she says .
However , there is also a need for a response from Member States in other areas in relation to the whole fishing industry .
Under@@ stand@@ ably , we want to help .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is the last opportunity that this House will have to express our positions on the broad principles of the reform of the Structural Funds before we start to examine the detailed legislative proposals in the coming months and it is therefore an extremely important report .
Full cooperation with ICTY remains a requirement .
I do not myself think that it will be possible in small shops with that huge variety of items packed close in to have unit pricing indicated simply by putting up post@@ ers at one end of the shops .
In practice we need to make this work .
In particular I want to deplore the role of the British Government in this .
Do we respond to UN calls to unblock roads to bring food and aid to the north ?
There is the question of all those national experts sent by Member States participating in certain bodies , whose names will be sent afterwards , not before , but there is at least the commitment that there should be no big secret as to who is advising us .
The important thing is : will the EU guarantee peace ?
There are so many different countries and cli@@ mates in the EU and the common agricultural policy has saved us from the tensions that would have arisen in recent years with the great reduction in the number of people on the land .
Maybe , over that period of time , the electronic tagging technology , which at the moment is far too expensive , may , like many other areas of technology , become more affordable with a combination of lower costs and better returns to the sheep producer .
rapporteur . - Mr President , could I start by thanking all my shadow rapporteurs , and indeed the French Presidency for facilitating an early second @-@ reading agreement ?
In EM@@ EA , the European Medicines Agency , problems were found with the management of procurement procedures .
In relation to the second part of the honourable Member &apos; s question : I feel this is something which needs consideration , and I will certainly bring his comments to the attention of the presidency and the Council when these matters are being considered .
In conclusion , others have referred to the need for China to consci@@ ously build up the standards it operates in relation to social , labour and environmental standards .
Earlier work under this initiative has identified on a global scale the consequences of increased pressure on gr@@ az@@ ing and mixing farming systems , and the dangers of the shift to industrial modes of production .
Clearly an urgency debate is the most relevant , given that this is not an issue on which we need a statement from either the Council or the Commission .
I thank with all my heart all the colleagues who signed this resolution .
He did not get it back so he appealed to the High King .
We also touch upon the fact that in many cases it is not possible to find the polluter , or to make the polluter pay .
We need to put pressure on our own Member States to bring forward more aid , and more aid in kind .
I would like just to introduce a nu@@ ance to this .
I was very disappointed to see the rejection of mandatory front @-@ of @-@ pack labelling with colour co@@ ding in this report .
Of course you are not the only one to blame for the current pi@@ tiful image of the European Union because facts like the genocide practices in Chechnya , Palestine and Kurdist@@ an cannot be disguised .
That in my view would be immoral to low @-@ income countries and it would be in@@ san@@ e economics for the working people of Europe .
Unfortunately I cannot hold out the same degree of hope for the chairman of the fund and the secretariat .
I consider myself fortunate to have been able to stay home with my children and my children fortunate to have had me .
Mr President , Mrs Sin@@ cla@@ ire and I represent a region of the United Kingdom whose citizens depend on the Single Market for their jobs and for their future .
Cohesion policy is the EU &apos; s key policy for enabling the regions to face growing challenges , such as climate change , population ageing , social migration , energy , or the economic and financial crisis , in the best possible way and , hence , to help increase the EU &apos; s global economic competitiveness .
I hope that this measure can be part of a wider approach adopted by the EU and national authorities to make it attractive to buy local , to build up local economies and consumer confidence .
I accept in spirit Amendments Nos 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 15 , 16 , 20 , 21 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 37 , 38 , 51 and 60 and partially Amendments Nos 5 and 9 , first part in spirit , Amendment No 11 , first part , Amendment Nos 12 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 39 , 40 , 43 ( second part ) , 46 ( second part ) , 50 ( second part ) and 69 ( second part ) .
They are equal and it is our responsibility to see that we speak up when this fundamental question is not put into practice in our application of laws in the Member States .
Europe needs competitive , but also sustainable , environmentally @-@ friendly agriculture producing the high @-@ quality food our citizens need for a healthy diet , without massive surpluses , without polluting our countryside , and without causing unnecessary animal suffering .
It is not true to say , as Mr Chichester implies , that this has been completely solved , that everyone knows exactly how to do it and how much it costs .
However , at the same time , we cannot forget that human rights are a cornerstone of modern European political philosophy .
I will make a special effort on energy efficiency .
The Commission scrutinised carefully the law , made some proposals and all these proposals were adopted .
She talked in her statement about raising our target to 30 % if the conditions are right .
Our monthly saga of Thursday afternoon urgencies shows a certain lack of coordination and coherence when we are looking at human rights situations
It is a competitive market .
The widespread removal of tropical timber is driven by an ins@@ ati@@ able appetite for products to gr@@ ace our homes .
I hope that the well @-@ established work of the EEA J@@ PC this week will be productive and will contribute to enhanced parliamentary cooperation , as well as to ensuring democratic parliamentary supervision within the EEA .
The decisions that remain will not be easy .
in writing . - As usually in this type of reports , the EP :
Ignor@@ ing 52 % of the available skills , knowledge and workforce of Europe for any sector or any level would be a serious loss .
In judging the value of label information , I believe that its relevance to food safety must be foremost in our minds .
I hope of course that the European Council will confirm and endorse this orientation .
Moreover , our discussion has underlined the necessity for both parties to promptly resume dialogues .
That will be done as soon as possible .
It is very important that we recognise regional differences .
It is a signal for action , and not an argument for delay .
That should provide the framework for enhanced cooperation , a new agenda for sport at EU level and also a draft decision for a two @-@ year EU sport programme for 2012 and 2013 .
The Committee on Regional Development believes this strategy can bring growth and sustainable development for the region .
It has to take the lead in the Mediterranean .
How strongly is the single market established at the moment ?
I would like to emphasise here that I fully endorse the provisions of this clause .
This requires our social model to be reformed to engage all our people , both women and men , in an inclusive economic and social Europe with equal access to opportunity , skills , personal development and the support this implies .
We want this ban to end .
This is established standard wording and the Commission therefore cannot accept a change to it .
A third country invo@@ king exclusively reasons of its own national security can apparently impose upon Europe , including directly upon private companies , the level of access to , use , and even protection of , data .
Mr President , we like to claim that the EU is a Union of values based on democracy and the rule of law .
Mr President , any Vice @-@ President of this Parliament other than yourself would actually of course remember that when the Coal and Steel Community was set up only six states broke away from the then 14 that compri@@ sed the Council of Europe and its somewhat larger parliamentary assembly .
More than 100 tonnes were sold to European export companies and subsequently exported by these companies to third countries with refunds .
These guidelines specify that the European Union will encourage states to accede to the second optional protocol of the Convention on Civil and Political Rights and comparable regional mechanisms aimed at the abolition of the death penalty .
President Fri@@ ed@@ mann rightly states that enormous responsibility lies with the Member States both for resources and for expenditure .
Those are the facts , not as presented by the rapporteur .
The Lisbon Treaty gives the EU almost as much power over such issues as the CAP gives to our agricultural policy , and it would be totally irresponsible to ignore the impact of all the ...
I will explain how the compromise package deals with the three fundamental issues that dominated discussion between the Council and Parliament during second reading : right of appeal ( Article 4 ) , the transparency mechanism ( Article 6 of the framework directive ) , including matters related to radio spectrum , and finally interoperability of digital TV equipment - which has been raised by many colleagues tonight .
- As chairman of the Committee on Budgets , I am duty bound to vote for the amendments from the committee .
Even if our respective approaches to economic and regulatory issues remain different , consumer safety and data protection illustrate this .
Furthermore , the Council is awarding special attention to the setting @-@ up of a European agency for the management of cooperation at external borders , which will integrate ad hoc centres into an institutional framework within the Community .
If we look at the demands on drivers these days with congestion and the just @-@ in @-@ time culture , we realise what strain there is on drivers .
However , the first part of the report brings three directives into a single regulation which would simplify .
Mr President , terrorism is defined as the use of violence and intimidation to achieve political ends .
I am not , and I do not think Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi was , and anybody else who has objected to the directive ought to be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to voice their doubts without being accused , as I say , of being somebody who is simply speaking on behalf of the tobacco industry .
If we could move away from thinking in terms of facts and figures , sums and statistics , markets and mer@@ chan@@ dise ; if we could remember at all times that our policies impact on the real lives of real people , then we would demonstrate a genuine commitment to the fundamental values we claim to cher@@ ish .
The difficulties manifest themselves today in Europe in the pressure for people from less developed countries wanting to migrate to Europe , and in people fleeing from some of the countries that are so desperate not just because of their economic situation , but also their lack of democracy and violence , and seeking asylum in the west .
There is an additional recent opinion sent on 11 August last year and there is a letter of formal notice sent on 10 April this year for failure to apply a number of articles properly .
The proposal is intended to replace the previous directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship , annu@@ lled by the European Court of Justice two years ago .
Certainly the revolution has had achievements , but the economic , as well as the political , costs have been very high .
A very interesting point in this communication is the question how we can develop the prevention culture .
However , the problem with this report is that , once again , it is calling for an EU perspective , and that is not appropriate .
Unfortunately the Flautre Report goes further by recognising the right of the European Court of Justice to rule over the list of banned terrorist organisations - which must remain a political decision not a judicial one - and claiming the Lisbon Treaty is required to make EU sanctions for abuses of human rights more effective .
Mr President , it is a pity that Mr Schulz has already left .
That was four years ago , and very little progress has been made since .
Despite the positive outcome , I should like to mention a few points .
Much still remains to be done , to echo the words of Commissioner Nielson .
The UK has been politically taken over .
Yet there are serious challenges before us in the buildings area , and I am sure that , in the approach that Mr Viola is taking , he will continue with the same level of serious scrutiny as we have had in the past .
A lot of time is also taken up with the need to request and obtain approval for each application from both arms of the budgetary authority .
However , we agree that it makes no sense to exclude projects financed wholly or partially by the European Union , especially structural funds , and we certainly agree that it makes sense to talk to neighbouring states outside the European Union .
Again , the release of all political prisoners would be an important step in this regard .
Member States should guarantee by this date that all necessary measures have been taken to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex in all matters covered by this directive .
What we can draw from that is that it is vital to work closely with the United States and other global markets as we share the same conclusions about the transparency in these markets .
Article 301 of the Penal Code on insulting Turk@@ ish@@ ness has resulted in many convictions and , in March - rather bizar@@ rely in my view - a court in Istanbul issued an order denying access to the video @-@ sharing website Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be when allegations were made on the sexu@@ ality of the founding father of modern Turkey , K@@ em@@ al At@@ at@@ ür@@ k .
It is a forum in which the citizens tell us how the many laws that we deal with in other committees affect them or do not affect them .
In June 2006 we will propose strengthening the right of disabled users to access emergency services and introducing a Community mechanism to address e @-@ accessibility issues .
We need legal certainty in the field of employment , both for employers and employees .
Moreover , the Irish scheme gives priority to the decommissioning of those vessels targeting sensitive white fish stocks , while giving vessel owners already facing reduced quotas , higher fuel costs etc. the opportunity to leave the sector .
I fully agree with the position that volunteering should be complementary to - and should not be intended to replace - public services .
I might be wrong , but it reminds me of some question raised by the Irish Minister and some Irish MEPs on the import from Brazil , traceability , and the opinion of the Irish farmers on lack of traceability .
It is a particular pleasure for me to be speaking alongside President Barroso .
Nevertheless , we will support the agreement because it is a major step forward in some states like the UK , which currently has no such protection for workers .
Now the preparations for the Washington Summit are in full s@@ wing .
Let me also say that , important and useful as these activities are , they are not , and never were , preconditions for the opening up of trade negotiations in September 2002 in accordance with the Cotonou Agreement .
Lastly , on strong institutions , Mr Barroso is absolutely right .
That deal with the Council and with the Portuguese Presidency said that we would agree in this Parliament this week prior to the Council of Ministers &apos; meeting in June .
In view of the present developments , how should one read the reiter@@ ation of the EU &apos; s readiness to recognise an independent Palestinian state when appropriate ?
En@@ courage Member States to adopt a system of &apos; opting out &apos; rather than &apos; opting in &apos; to organ donation .
The question is whether existing laws work well .
We see ourselves working together at a set of European institutions fighting to improve the situation and ensure that the Kyoto Protocol is ratified .
. Mr President , may I first of all express my utter condemnation and dis@@ gust concerning the terrorist attacks on London today in which , according to the latest reports , over 40 people have been murdered and many hundreds injured .
Free trade must be about reciprocity .
They are wrong .
Iran has become a source of extremist doctrine , it carries out and spon@@ sors acts of international terrorism , has a dangerous influence on populations of young Shi@@ as in the Gulf States , in Iraq and in Lebanon and does not hesitate to ally with Sun@@ ni terrorist groups in Gaza and beyond .
This is a legal im@@ possibility .
in writing . - The Greens / EFA have been able to include an important number of amendments which focused on environmental and social conditioning of direct payments , measures against climate change , a broader and more inclusive approach to rural territorial development and fair income for farmers .
If our own history in Europe has taught us anything , if our own experience of conflict resolution within the European Union or indeed in the wider world has taught us anything , it is that only through negotiation and dialogue can we actually achieve a lasting and just settlement .
A ban has been put in place in respect of the importation of pet birds .
I accept Amendments Nos 3 , 4 and 7 .
If the answer to these questions is yes , then we should all commend as brave the Israeli Government for their action in Gaza .
There are many commendable aspects to it .
Today , we can say that the Lisbon Treaty is now fully operational .
On the other hand , the sectoral approach would enable us to better address the specific aspects of the different installations or activities .
If we are seriously saying that recreational fishing is destroying our fish stocks , then in my mind they are missing a fundamental issue as far as d@@ win@@ dling fish stocks are concerned .
I would hope that the spirit coming out of the European Council later this week is one of cooperation .
For one thing , the context of the CJD crisis has dominated European health debates for most of the year .
I wonder whether it would not be better for everybody if the British just were not part of this European Union .
It is important that we consider the needs of peripheral European countries who encounter several geographic barriers that depend on a strong transport network to supply their countries , and for their economic growth .
It is not a one @-@ way process .
On the Commission &apos; s own admission , Romania suffers from serious and widespread corruption ; it has a judiciary which is neither efficient nor independent ; it does not possess genuine media freedom ; it cannot implement the at local and regional level ; it fails to prevent money laundering ; it permits the ill @-@ treatment of prisoners in custody ; it fails to enforce laws against child and sexual trafficking .
The Czech Court and the Irish Parliament have comprehensively and decisively bl@@ unted the attack upon the Treaty from the nationalist and reacti@@ onary forces .
Some EU Member States put financial gain above human rights and I do not believe that that is acceptable .
The package is very good , but now much will depend on whether the Finnish Presidency will approve it and on the negotiations between the Council and Parliament , while it remains a Council decision .
This issue will have to be raised in a more general context , because it concerns not only the MEPs attending this and other climate change meetings , but also other international fora .
It will need a lot of negotiation .
Through ECHO the Commission funds more than one third of the total humanitarian aid available to refugees in Tanzania .
To sum up , the Commission will analyse in detail each amendment adopted by Parliament and will give its reactions in early November through the &apos; letter on execu@@ t@@ ability &apos; - as it does every year - explaining all the necessary details .
It will not , therefore , be necessary to include the table as an integral part of the resolution .
On enlargement , at the European Council President Prodi presented the progress report , the strategy paper and recommendations , as well as the study of issues arising from Turkey &apos; s membership , produced by the Commission on 6 October .
It is also supporting the victims , as it does sexual @-@ abuse victims , through its outreach programmes through the world and it is taking steps to prevent a repetition of these terrible incidents .
We will proceed as it is on the order paper .
The next item is the report by P@@ á@@ l Schmitt , on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education , on university @-@ business dialogue : a new partnership for the modernisation of Europe &apos; s universities - .
We would like to have a real internal market in the field of energy by 2014 .

As such , it should not only respect the EU &apos; s fundamental values in its activities , but also work for their promotion , particularly in a field which touches upon critical questions relating to migration and freedom of movement .
If , I stress the word if , Israel wants to declare goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin , EU customs authorities would not be able to share this interpretation .

This amazing lady not only qualified as an English solici@@ tor , having previously qualified in Germany , but , as a true European of her own generation , she also obtained a doc@@ torate from the Sor@@ bon@@ ne the title of which was the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments .
That we have arrived at this point does great credit to him and everybody else who has worked on this dossier .
It is not a cure @-@ all , but it is one of the many means that we can use .
It seems to me that this set of initiatives is going forward in a way which risks setting at n@@ aught the protection provided by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
It will be hard work to get everything ready for implementation at the end of 2006 .
This individual action was undertaken without the knowledge of the rapporteur .
It is fair to say that Tajikistan &apos; s record in democratisation and human rights is imperfect , but I am convinced that dialogue and engagement on the EU &apos; s part will encourage Tajikistan towards positive change .
Finally , and this should concern everyone in this House , even if they are far from the sea , it will undermine support for the European Union and give added fuel to those who say there is only one way out of this desperate Common Fisheries Policy and that is to leave the European Union .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , when the European system of protected design@@ ations of origin ( PD@@ Os ) , protected geographical indications ( P@@ G@@ Is ) and traditional speci@@ alities guaranteed ( TS@@ Gs ) was set up , equivalent systems already existed in some Member States .
To move this agenda forward , we have spent nine months consulting all stakeholders on the obstacles they encountered and disti@@ lled the result in the recently published Commission communication , &apos; A stronger EU @-@ US Partnership and a more open market for the 21st century &quot; .
The Indian forestry authorities say they are unable to cope with po@@ aching gangs , due to chronic under@@ funding .
Just last month , Commissioner Lamy proposed a pragmatic solution which , in his view , is workable , sustainable and legally secure , because it complies with both the Doha mandate and the compromise text of 16 December 2002 that was discussed within the WTO .
This dialogue takes into account our long @-@ standing policy of openness and inclu@@ siveness and it also reflects the wide differences in the policy fields and the diversity of stakeholders .
I decline to take the view that we should hedge the conclusions of our Election Observation Mis@@ sions around with political considerations .
The lack of transparency on world oil markets facilitates speculation and inhi@@ bits investment in the oil sector .
They say that they are sick of being treated as nothing and that they feel that they have no value to society .
My second concern is about fundamental rights .
This is very much on the agenda and in our financial perspective .
What is the state of play and the next steps in ACTA ?
The oil price per barrel is now at its lowest level ever .
The digital economy - and more specifically e @-@ commerce - has great potential to improve consumer welfare by making a greater range of products available , boosting price competition and developing new markets .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - The budget for the trade unions is approximately EUR 500 000 per year , which is given from the Community budget .
Mr President , I have dealt with 19 cases of people who have been fraudul@@ ently exposed to expenditure and to debt actions because of European City Gui@@ des .
Mr President , like other speakers , I am glad that in relation to the Napolitano report we have moved forward on some important points .
However , the 10th anniversary of the Statute &apos; s entry into force does offer us now an opportunity to make a clear assessment of the role of the ICC and , in my view , the Court has , to its credit , stuck rigi@@ dly to its brief , es@@ che@@ wing mis@@ chiev@@ ous prosecutions and seeking to arra@@ ign only the most serious tyr@@ ants .
To begin with the last point , the Commission has been able to achieve a certain success in avoiding the necessity to report operations under EUR 12 500 .
I was myself present at the Burundi donors &apos; conference chaired by Nelson Mandela in Paris in December , which endorsed the peace agreement .
Just before the agreement was signed the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble spoke about how the accord could represent an e@@ po@@ ch @-@ making end to our internal Cold War which would be enormously liber@@ ating for the people of the island as a whole .
It is not enough to argue that Europe is picking up its share of the bill by paying most of the world &apos; s development aid , true as this may be , or by increasing even further our humanitarian assistance .
We have already seen the huge explosion in the use of mobile technology .
I congratulate the rapporteur .
They were inspired by those events to call for similar peaceful change to democratic plural democracy away from autocr@@ atic one @-@ party rule .
I very much agree with Mr Langen that the Commission must get on and complete the standar@@ di@@ zation mandates .
How do we ensure equal access to mobility for all people when Member States do not have equal access to language skills ?
If we are to have any credibility whatsoever in relation to human rights and international law we must insist that all Member States respect those norms .
I too would like to welcome Nicole P@@ ér@@ y back here in the Chamber and perhaps I could say , Nicole , that we miss you particularly when we have extremely difficult votes to trans@@ act .
It is a very low threshold ; it is very easy to go back to a full normal procedure .
The other aspect is that it is also clear from the work we and others have done that not enough professions are actually thinking in terms of moving into a European qualifications framework .
Finally , I would like to express my confidence in Commissioner Malmström &apos; s ability to resolve these complicated issues .
It will not include provisions modifying substantive intellectual property law such as the creation of new rights , the scope of protection or duration .
It is a pity that we still have to raise this subject .
The EU has already taken steps in order to address global food security by adapting the CAP to the changed market and global situation .
First of all , if we are going to discuss the content of a constitution , we should not single out one constitution of one Member State .
It is also important to say that farmers welcome the controls concerning animal food production .
Under this constitutional article , abortion is illegal in Ireland .
I have been taught a painful lesson over the past few days , but this will only give me additional energy to pursue progress and democracy in Lithuania .
The second point which will come through in our consideration of the telecom package , is that in this very fast @-@ moving world there is concern within the industry and amongst investors that excessively rigid targets in terms of market share thresholds for investigation - and that can be too much or too little in many cases - should not be allowed to inhi@@ bit your consideration of areas where there is a genuine competitive issue at stake .
More needs to be done to fold this kind of approach into our day @-@ to @-@ day considerations at this level .
The British Presidency has indeed set itself an ambitious agenda .
There are rumours circulating concerning new furniture that has been purchased for the D@@ 3 Building .
Mr President , you did it !
To underestimate those difficulties would be ultimately to undermine the enlargement process .
I had also hoped that I would have a chance to personally thank President Gil @-@ Robles because he has been a continual support to me in my work as mediator for abducted children , and also to thank Mr Söderman for his excellent work as European Ombudsman .
Here we need to go to at least as far and perhaps beyond the measures agreed in the Bi@@ o @-@ Safety Protocol in Montreal in January .
In one breath it is declared that the Union &quot; s institutions have a duty to inform citizens clearly and objectively about the proposed Constitution , yet in the same paragraph it is decre@@ ed that these same institutions have a political responsibility to support ratification .
Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt said that the precautionary principle has to be the right approach .
It is important to ensure the clarity of the guidelines in preparation for the more substantial changes that will take place next year .
When Stalin outlined his project for Central and Eastern Europe , Winston Churchill &apos; s reply was &apos; the eag@@ le must let the small bird sing &apos; .
Such a slu@@ r on our interinstitutional relationship must not be allowed to stand .
This plenary resolution will follow on from the summary report reflecting the results of our regular dialogue .
That is why we have a labelling chapter in our CFP reform .
They are looking for support from Member States and they are looking to the EU to put in place a framework that is conducive to job creation , to entrepreneurship and to the support of SMEs , but crucially , that framework must link growth in the economy with the creation of decent jobs and an improvement in the well @-@ being of all citizens , especially those below the poverty line .
We have no monitoring system for that at all , and therefore it seems to us no real way of knowing whether our policies for judging who is a refugee , and who is an illegal immigrant , actually work .
My basic point is : how could it be possible to interpret the Rules to say that 40 absent people can say to the rest of us that we do not form a qu@@ or@@ um and ensure that we do not make a qu@@ or@@ um ?
Have the services had time to count yet ?
We need safe cosmetic products .
I believe the 20 % target that was unanimously agreed is reach@@ able if the Member States act with real determination in implementing all the measures that they can take to achieve what is a very important goal for the European Union and indeed for the world .
The clean development mechanism is essential to that protocol &apos; s success and has the potential to run directly contrary to the M@@ AI .
In addition , attempts by myself and others to ensure that the focus of the label remained on heritage , and not on political integration , were rejected .
However , as I mentioned previously , the Commission &apos; s services are already well into the process of evaluating these opinions .
In the action plan towards an integrated internal control framework , the Commission has committed itself to making proposals for simplified rules on cost eligibility issues .
We have to try and aim for a system right across the European Union that is as easy and as cost @-@ effective as it is in the USA .
For these groups of refugees , resettlement can be the only solution .
We based our work on the Western European Nuclear Regulators &apos; Association ( W@@ EN@@ RA ) and on experience in the High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management .
Regarding employment and social issues , the Commission and the Indian Labour Minister agreed in a bilateral meeting a work programme for 2006 and 2007 based on the Joint Action Plan .
Hopefully , therefore , if the legislation r@@ hy@@ th@@ m is not subject to delay , we could be fully implementing several of these necessary reforms in full by the beginning of 2003 .
The Commission will certainly be involved in supporting the idea of continuing this presence .
This is the most that could have been achieved and I , therefore , ask the European Parliament to vote for it .
However , the reality is that corruption does exist in many developing countries and , while we must continue to promote good governance in these countries , we have a more pressing responsibility to help the many millions of people dying of starvation and disease in the world .
. Mr President , this report represents a wide @-@ ranging analysis of the problems facing Romania in its development to meet the high standards we demand for joining the European Union .
It may be that there are other sorts of animal cruelty in the world - I am sure there are ; but an indiscriminate tr@@ apping system which traps live animals in in@@ descri@@ b@@ able pain must be one of the worst , and incidentally one of the avoidable , instances of such cruelty .
Will they legislate without counting the cost ?
Let me start by emphasising the success of the twin @-@ track strategy .
in writing . - The reason for this statement and next month &apos; s resolution is the appalling situation regarding Airbus in Europe .
The European Union has to address this issue .
One and a half years later , the very same Supreme Council deprived one third of its own voters of their voting rights .
Once again that would be a challenge for Parliament .
These people have no formal refugee protection status .
To pursue our goals of highest standards on nuclear safety , we interact with Russia both at the bilateral level and in multilateral fora such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the G8 .
It is not good enough for the European Parliament , which was responsible for significant agreements .
However , today it is clear that economic and political enlargement of Europe is not enough to have Europe truly integrated as a &apos; community of values &apos; .
The first b@@ ou@@ quet I am throwing is because of the introduction of PR for euro elections - a long awaited improvement in our lot .
Research carried out by organisations such as the Consumers &apos; Association has highlighted the kinds of tactics adopted by some of these big @-@ name companies .
It is Parliament &apos; s wish from last year and we want to ensure that this money on R@@ echar and Re@@ tex is indeed spent .
Our support for Roma in Kosovo also includes education .
By contrast bilateral trade relations and investment are not developing as well as the Commission would like .
Of course life is not risk @-@ free but there has to be a balance in that risk and if people know what the choices are , they are more likely to be able to make an informed judgement .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission is greatly concerned about recent developments in East Jerusalem , in particular the destruction of Palestinian @-@ owned houses and the expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem .
Signific@@ antly , all major opposition parties will participate in the forthcoming elections .
Madam President , the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad bru@@ sh affair .
Only with price improvement will retail customers get the good prices they deserve .
There is a debate in this Parliament about whether , in a pre @-@ legislative report of this kind , environ@@ ment@@ alists should be pressing to send a strong signal to the Commission to be tough , or whether we should try to be realistic in framing measures which might actually be those that end up close to the final form at the end of the day .
Like many other countries - Côte d &quot; Ivoire , Uzbekistan and Chechnya , etc . - East Timor has been exploited by bigger powers .
We might also do serious damage to the European Parliament , as the European press seems to be totally opposed , along with the Council and the Commission , to what we want to achieve .
That means that any of us would also be susceptible to be taken to court for these reasons as well .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - In the new Member States you have different conditions .
The goodwill is there .
I wonder whether that means that the UK Independence Party is now transferring in its entirety , or at least the two Members who are present here , to the other group .
That means pursuing the political , social and economic agenda already outlined in the EU Lebanon Action Plan .
Lastly , I hope to see more dialogue between moderate Muslim leaders and the EU &apos; s political classes if we are to avoid the much feared clash of civilisations as a scenario .
The Commission did exactly that when adopting the White Paper this year .
Unfortunately , it cannot support the amendment suggesting the participation of representatives of the European Parliament in the Advisory Committee .
I had expected that the Members of the European Parliament would be given an opportunity to cast a vote on the changes to the treaty being introduced following the Amsterdam Summit .
That is not in dispute .
The amendments which we can accept will enable the Commission to tighten up the provisions relating to developing countries , whilst at the same time preserving the overall balance .
The enlargement of the Union is an economic and political opportunity for Europe .
Moving all these dossiers forward over the next six months is essential to build a new economy , because - let us make no mistake - the post @-@ crisis economy cannot and will not be the same as the pre @-@ crisis economy .
This is a Charter that brings together rights that belong to no party and to every party .
It is right and proper that we make constructive proposals for the future handling of foot and mouth outbreaks .
Well , sometimes , Mr President , you need a small ang@@ el at your shoulder .
It can be done , as the Kremlin exercises a decisive influence on Russia &apos; s power structures and judiciary .
We know from surveys that before 1993 compliance with customs controls was costing traders some ECU 7.5 billion every year - that is based on 1992 trade levels but expressed in today &apos; s money .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report , which I believe to be an extremely important piece of work .
For whom are we making this appeal ?
The use requests for data are already targeted when it comes to bulk data .
We will put in place a programme for protecting critical infrastructure right across Europe from terrorist attack .
The fact that France , Germany and the Netherlands are now following the UK &apos; s example in deploying it in relation to the medical professions serves to demonstrate that the line the UK has always taken is the practical one .
My three points are as follows . First , on cost : one of the great deficiencies of the Commission &apos; s approach to environmental legislation is that it seems prepared to ignore the cost of legislation .
The timeshare codes of conduct could be used to raise standards and to address those unfair and opaque practices not caught by the directive .
In fact , such a charge would be a more sub@@ tle instrument since it could actually be calculated to reflect both the amount of fuel used and also , by fac@@ tor@@ ing in the efficiency of the aircraft &apos; s engine , the amount of pollutants generated .
It is about the whole management structure of the Commission ; the relationship between the staff and their directors ; the relationship between the directors and the directors @-@ general ; the relationship between the directors @-@ general and the Commissioners and their cab@@ in@@ ets .
It is worthwhile reminding colleagues throughout the House who are working on legal texts that this is a principle that we all need to bear in mind when we are amending legislative texts of any kind .
However , thanks to the victory of democratic protesters in December 2004 , the credibility of multi @-@ party elections and the freedom of the press was established .
Every Member State has its own s@@ ne@@ ak@@ y little tri@@ cks for making sure that people do not find it too easy to go to other countries and practice their professions .
Cornillet report ( A5 @-@ 02@@ 23 / 2001 )
We are now finalising the joint programme in a process that involves the EU Member States .
On the contrary , a free European labour market is what is needed to present Europe as a model , as a partner and as a world leader .
Musharraf stated the milit@@ ants were linked to al @-@ Qa &apos; ida .
A number of Members raised the budget issue .
Nothing I have heard in this debate would cause me to change my mind .
But sadly , as President V@@ ác@@ lav Klaus pointed out when he came here , you do not actually think there should be any alternative view and , as a result of that , your presidency has been marked by your deeply pre@@ judicial manner in the way in which you have treated the Members of this House who have stood up and opposed the Constitution / Lisbon Treaty .
The universities ignored the rulings , denying them the rights associated with teaching staff , including the twice @-@ yearly pay rises so generous in the academic system in Italy .
Mr President , groundwater is a pri@@ cel@@ ess natural resource , not a national resource , and it should be treated as a resource without which humanity cannot survive .
Prevention means that we should influence the policy mix at the national level .
That is what happened in Dover .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - Madam President , as we all know and can read every day , the Arctic is increasing in importance , and it deserves greater attention from the European Union as well .
If not , it will come up tomorrow before the vote .
Through these measures the Commission intends to contribute to the gradual creation of a European Defence E@@ qui@@ p@@ ment Market which is more transparent and open between Member States and which , whilst respecting the sector &apos; s specific nature , would increase economic efficiency .
On the serious matter of falsi@@ fying records , the UK average fine was EUR 132 000 while in Germany it was a der@@ is@@ ory EUR 98 - but EUR 98 more than in the Republic of Ireland which , according to those official Commission figures , had no penalties to declare in 2003 , although it bel@@ atedly admitted that it had 103 serious infringements !
In relation to agricultural expenditure , I fully agree that more emphasis must be placed on the environment , food safety , traceability , animal welfare and consumer information .
We have to be certain in our own minds that we , as the only directly elected , democratically accountable body within the European Union should stand up for our right to be the final arbitr@@ ators and decision @-@ makers .
That is why the Commission has put forward a communication setting out the steps needed to reinvigorate international negotiations .
I hope the group will pull back .
This shortfall has led to numerous premature deaths from cancer in cases where early detection could have provided a much better chance of survival , so anybody who claims that the relevant authorities can deal most adequately with the after @-@ effects of a nuclear weapons accident is also not telling the whole truth .
Indeed , it may even pri@@ se apart and ref@@ as@@ hi@@ on Europe &apos; s political families .
I have referred to some of them earlier in the answers that I have given , particularly to Mr Whitehead .
One of them was to burn the German flag and to send the ashes to Chancellor Kohl .
There has been much speculation and some analysis of the latest papers as they per@@ tain to agriculture , but there has been little official word from the Commission or Council on this vital matter .
What can Parliament@@ arians do ?
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . - Mr President , one of the strongest features of the Treaty will be that it marks the coming of age of the common foreign security and defence policy .
Sadly , the totalitarian despo@@ t , Mr Milosevic , is fu@@ elling the f@@ lam@@ es of genocide and compo@@ unding the misery of the Koso@@ var Alb@@ anians .
The Commission fully agrees that it is now very important that Member States adequately transpose the new concepts introduced by the directive on unfair commercial practices and that national authorities also contribute to uniform implementation of the directive right across the EU .
They would be in a peculiar position because they would find that non @-@ Member States were involved in a free movement arrangement which as Member States they were not part of .
The task of the shadow rapporteurs has been relatively easy because we have agreed with a lot of the content and we have been looking for ways to further improve the direction of his text .
In fact , the new President of the Council , President Van Rompuy , has already announced that he wants an informal exchange of views at the beginning of February .
Why has the Council refused to respond to Parliament &quot; s consistent calls in this respect ?
First and foremost , it is about choice , better value and better service to consumers of energy , both domestic and commercial .
We also have more money in the programme in recognition of its importance .
I should also like to say a few words about the election observation missions .
I believe that the consequences have been disproportionate to the failure of the Commission as a college .
We have to find a way forward .
Could you kindly check your notes ?
Who has the best capacity to ensure citizens understand exactly what is happening at a European level ?
Several people have lost their lives , many have disappeared , many have been injured .
China comes second , with about 14 % , together with the European Union , but in order to have the equilibrium which is needed regarding the contribution by each country to the battle against climate change , we have to take into account what the United Nations Climate Change Conference states , i.e. that each country should contribute in a common but differentiated way , which means that countries like China , India and other fast @-@ developing countries , which have contributed to a smaller degree historically to the creation of the greenhouse phenomenon and have only a fraction of the per capita income of the developed countries , have to contribute in a different way according to their capabilities and their possibilities , without hin@@ dering their economic development and without creating unfair competition with other countries .
The Government is not from your family , but you do not accept the same standards when there is a Socialist government .
Now that the European Parliament has all the elements in its hands to make a well @-@ informed decision , and given the role played by the European Community in forging this permanent solution , it would be regrettable if the European Community could not accept it in time .
On an overall level , payments in the 2007 budget must reach 1.@@ 04 % of EU GNI if we are to deliver effective programmes to our citizens .
We did not want to burden the accession of these two countries with the issue of the future procedure , but I hope that we can come to an agreement with the Commission and the Council today to ensure that , in future , there is a better procedure and a more serious opportunity for Parliament to give its opinion on this issue .
I also want to confirm that traceability will be included in the directive .
Is it intended to make it mandatory on national governments to implement such a regional policy , thus providing jobs in the regions to sustain rural communities and provide off @-@ farm employment for farmers who do not have viable farms and other rural dwel@@ lers ?
We are the biggest market and the most lucrative market in the world for fish products .
This commitment was emphasised by the Cologne Council and Feira when it was stated that strategic decisions had to be taken by December 2000 .
It is clear that this should not be held up as an example of better regulation and , given the extensive agenda of financial legislation over the coming months , I hope we can avoid a repetition of this inefficient process .
There are even reports that people are deliberately killed to get their organs : for example , practitioners of Falun Gong in China .
In order to ensure comprehensive information , the Commission may also look into the issue of availability of existing alternative products to substances being known as endocrine disrup@@ tors .
Agreement is difficult .
I am disappointed that Elmar Brok has gone because I want to say to him that this new orientation means we will need new people to work in his transatlantic legislators &apos; dialogue because we have new challenges to meet .
I am probably the least surprised person about the findings of the Committee of Wise Men , because , as many colleagues know , since 1990 I have been pursuing a fraud in DG XX@@ III .
I spoke to two women who expressed the hope that things might slowly get better .
Mr President , I believe Romania remains on track for accession by 1 January 2007 .
I took full note when Mr Bushill @-@ Matthews said that he will be watching me : that , of course , is his job and that of Parliament .
In fisheries , the policy always seems to be about reducing the catch .
I seem to remember saying a few weeks ago that I regretted that would be the last time he spoke as chairman of the Committee on Budgets , and yet he is still here .
As you know , there is going to be a general election in the United Kingdom within the next few weeks .
It is for these reasons that British Conservatives have voted against the Malmström resolution .
Madam President , the promotion of a sustainable workforce for health across Europe is crucial in continuing our improvement in healthcare services and facilities across the 27 Member States .
Reform of external assistance &quot; yes &quot; , sufficient staff numbers to manage projects &quot; yes &quot; , decentralisation to delegations &quot; yes &quot; , increased emphasis on programming , movement to ex post financial assessment , streamlined comitology arrangements &quot; yes &quot; , &quot; yes &quot; , &quot; yes &quot; .
Obviously this refers to fires , but the solidarity fund covers flooding .
The people of Southern Sudan have waited a long time for the chance to exercise their right of self @-@ determination .
It would be a measure that would be inclusive , that would enable more Members to hold positions of responsibility , and that would make it easier to distribute such posts politically across Parliament .
It is especially inappropriate because the material directly from the pharmaceutical company would , in the patient &apos; s eyes , carry the legitimacy of the doctor distributing it .
Similarly , we voted in favour of the first part of paragraph 41 and against the second part .
It should be sensible , rational and necessary regulation , not regulation for regulation &apos; s sake .
All of them are already bi@@ lingu@@ al .
But in providing the assistance , in providing the resources to deal with conflict prevention , I just want to make one point .
In households , on heating and cooling , it is also perfectly possible , and in the transport sector also .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , the proposal for a directive on aviation security charges is the result of the debate on financing aviation security which has been on the table since 2001 .
I would prefer that partnership approach to continue on a voluntary basis .
This requires ongoing monitoring and we very much welcome the revision of the series of directives which are the subject of this debate this evening .
It will also need to address the question of institutional capacities and reform needs , customs , police and the judiciary and the question of corruption in general .
We want consumers to take maximum benefits from the choice , diversity and innovation available in a thriving market of nearly 500 million consumers , the largest retail market in the world .
First , there is the competitiveness challenge . This has many important European dimensions : better regulation , a strong and appropriate competition policy , research and development , the removal of barriers in the internal market , and perhaps above all innovation , in relation to which the proposed European institute for technology can make an important contribution .
National data protection authorities are therefore charged with the task of ensuring this compliance and , if necessary , taking appropriate measures to enforce compliance .
Regarding the question of targets , I , like most of you , regret that a compromise has only been possible without binding targets , but the final version of the amendments introduces a number of binding measures , which strongly compens@@ ates for the loss of binding targets .
The ruling party apparently does not like the fact that Sam Rainsy den@@ oun@@ ces corruption and human rights abuses .
We cannot continue to go on relying on individual complaints , such as those that have been mentioned , on inspection or on self @-@ inspection - by which I mean the reporting requirement .
Within well @-@ studied groups , between 12 % and 52 % of species are threatened with extinction , according to the I@@ U@@ C@@ N Red Lis@@ t .
We welcome the support given by that Parliament to the Commission &apos; s approach to building a more effective partnership with the United Nations .
I would like to say to Mr Chichester that in Britain Ca@@ es@@ ar &apos; s wife has been putting it about a little bit !
Such an aim is fully in line with our expressed wish to support small businesses in their antagon@@ istic and - in most instances - unfair fight for survival against the large companies .
Of course , we shall have the best possible support for research and science , but we shall also ensure that we can have a functioning market - and a functioning transatlantic market because that is crucial .
They tell us that 18 % of fatal accidents involve trucks or coaches and yet buses and coaches are actually one of the safer forms of road transport .
Currently we are , of course , looking at the 2010 budget , and there are still a lot of issues to be resolved before we can agree that .
Mr President , Amendment No 7@@ 09 may have to be adjusted technically to reflect the result of the vote today .
Our ability to operate the traditional consensus and solidarity is going to become harder , not easier , which makes it all the more important that the role of the Commission grows in navig@@ ating our way through the different and competing interests and views that businesses and Member States have on this subject .
It also acknowledges fully the dramatic and welcome improvements in the implementation that we have seen in recent times .
For the markets it would be sufficient to know that there is a clearly articulated capability and willingness to act if really necessary .
In many ACP countries bananas grow in ter@@ rain un@@ suitable for other crops , so unemployment grows massively .
E@@ vil must never be allowed to prevail , and the sooner we can see freedom , democracy , humanity and women &apos; s rights restored to Iran , the better it will be for the whole world .
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it is ; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important .
There is nothing in the Treaties that says that must happen .
We have to be very careful and be@@ ware of what I might call &apos; banning cre@@ ep &apos; .
I have heard precious little from him since having presi@@ ded over the Liberal group he got political asylum in the EPP Group some years ago .
In a largely globalised and deregul@@ ated world , it is absolutely necessary to enable consumers to know where a product comes from and what they are buying .
Just before Christmas , Serbia applied for EU membership , and Croatia could join as soon as 2012 .
Others might give it another name , but it gets us to where we want to be at this point .
We also reject the integration of transport into the Lisbon Treaty , as set out in Article 27 , and we take the opportunity of reaffirm@@ ing our strong view that , in the UK , this Treaty must be subject to ratification by the electorate through a referendum .
I believe that , under the Swedish , or especially under the Spanish , Presidency , we can hold another one to reflect on the progress we have made and to make a commitment to go further .
Somalia remains a context where fundamental rights and respect for basic human dignity continue to be sh@@ un@@ ned by armed entities perpetrat@@ ing systematic and widespread attacks against civilians .
I cannot accept that it should apply to core public services .
I have always supported the highest civil and political rights and good governance for all states .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for being present in this debate .
It has no power to set interest rates , no power over exchange rates , little power over government spending restricted by the Stability Pact and , if many people in this Parliament had their way , it would have no power over its own tax rates .
Are they perfect ?
At the same time , I am evaluating how the Directive on In@@ junc@@ tions was implemented by the Member States and the impact that it has had on the enforcement of consumer rights in the EU .
But before we activate this mechanism , I am calling - and I will continue to call - on Member States to put solidarity into action : not only to come out with beautiful words , but to act .
My colleagues from Spain battle with the evil campaign of terror w@@ aged by ETA .
Please do not forget that measures under A@@ x@@ is 3 , if used correctly , could contribute significantly to promoting economic growth and job creation in rural areas .
The T@@ IM is delivering social allowances and fuel .
This is committed for action through the World Food Programme , UNHCR , and the International Red Cross .
Perhaps we should finish the point by welcoming the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES , Appendix II , full stop .
At the same time , the absence of such a dialogue may be an early @-@ warning sign for forthcoming inter@@ religious tensions and conflict .
No one questions the need for innovation and research in Europe , but this is the wrong way to do it .
Thanks to Mr Caudron and the rapporteurs on the specific programmes , we have worked efficiently and we now have plenty of time for our scientists to prepare , knowing our aim is to make the sixth framework programme efficient , well managed , easy to take part in and above repro@@ ach from the financial point of view .
Just to follow on from Mr Newton Dunn &apos; s question regarding the decisions made in secret in the Council , could the Minister possibly list those legisl@@ atures in the world , that he referred to , where decisions are made in secret ?
That is fundamental in solving the political conflict that is now taking place in the Basque Country and the Spanish State .
Indeed , the Commission def@@ ends the interests of the EU sector in trade negotiations and takes into account its sensitivities as far as possible , even when faced with strong pressure from our trading partners .
However , that in itself implies that the current legislation provides adequate protection .
Certainly the feedback I get in the UK tells me that the perception is that far too much money is already being spent on political projects , both at home and most certainly - of all places - here in Strasbourg .
Fif@@ teen amendments in Parliament &apos; s second reading were not acceptable to the Council .
I am pleased we have highlighted the gender issue and asked Member States to deal with the issue of men and women who take time off to care and that we have paid attention to the issue of mobility and the role of the EU 2020 strategy .
The Agreement will also , as the Minister pointed out , trigger Lebanon &apos; s undertakings on cooperation in counter @-@ terrorism , set out in the exchange of letters to which he referred .
We cannot expect a country like the Comoros to know what fish has been taken out .
Is there such a rule book ?
Of course we keep our ideological differences and keep up the political debate , but we make an effort to have a stronger Europe .
It is not a fact .
In short , the challenges facing us as we look at the future financial perspective are very significant indeed .
It is in really bad shape .
I am pleased that you explained to us the range of studies that you have commissioned , including impact assessment .
At that stage barely any Europeans were interested in the process of economic and monetary union .
I appreciate his good humour and I appreciate his good judgement .
This would have negative consequences for employment and could even encourage the black economy in the Member States concerned .
These targets were exceeded with three new appointments being made to the A1 grade and seven new appointments to the A@@ 2 grade .
My role on that board will be that of the chief executive officer .
We therefore need innovative solutions to tackle the enormous economic problems we are faced with .
Buddhist monks have written &apos; no &apos; on their mon@@ aster@@ y walls to send their message to Burmese civilians for the constitutional referendum in May .
I think this constitutes further proof that Parliament is committed to sport .
Our Group considered very carefully whether to vote in favour of this agreement .
I will invite the leaders of the big listed companies to sit around a table in March to promote a dialogue with stakeholders in the business sector to get things moving .
In fact we have only 48 minutes .
We can speak all we like in this Parliament but at the end of the day it is what is happening down on the farm that really counts .
We must not put these achievements at risk through any kind of complacency or distr@@ action by other - sometimes perhaps more urgent - matters .
Why are we in this impossible situation ?
Too often we miss the opportunity to intervene and prevent conflict .
Respec@@ t for Anna Politkovskaya commits us to make this clear to President Putin in forthcoming summits .
The Commission has already proposed in the social agenda presented in 28 June 2000 to invite the European Foundation for the Improv@@ ement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin - which is an existing structure - to put in place an information mechanism for change .
Now there is a new situation , to which we reacted immediately , and so has and had the Quartet .
Mr President , this has been a long journey , from Tampere , where we saw just the outlines of an area of freedom , security and justice - and perhaps we talk too much - to this extraordinary position where we have Stockholm and Lisbon colli@@ ding .
That assembly will ensure that Wales , like Britain , will play a full part in our people &apos; s Europe .
I hope , in the mean time , that when it comes to the December Council their voluntary efforts will be taken into account , recognised and rewarded .
It has massive public interest and raises questions at a time when we are proceeding in the field of Justice and Home Affairs at European level on the basis of mutual recognition .
I think that , if we had met two or three days after Copenhagen was over , few of us would have thought that , one year later , all the elements of the Copenhagen Accord would be included in a binding UN agreement .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Members of Parliament for their interesting speeches - I have learned a lot of new things , including about the equal treatment of the Belgian Queen , and o@@ live growing .
The best thing the UK could do to help the Irish and to help the Scottish is to improve the very inferior British motorway system on which we depend to get to our markets .
Long @-@ term British residents from non @-@ EU countries , from the Commonwealth for example , will now receive guaranteed equal access to education , health care and other benefits on the Contin@@ ent .
I am pleased to stress , because it is important , that we must make absolutely certain that we do everything to welcome new countries into the European Union through the MEDIA II programme , which is just one example , to make certain that they not only respect their minority cultures , languages and religions but that they do everything to encourage them , because a Europe that is built on a background of successful cultures and respect for other people &apos; s cultures and minority languages will be a more prosperous and successful one in the future .
Yes , oil supply is a matter which has to concern us .
But we also must avoid panic , because if we panic we will make poor decisions .
If the current regime remains unchanged , it is estimated that there would be around 15 000 fewer jobs in 2012 , a loss of more than 75 % .
Mr President , I will be very brief because any sentiments I express will largely echo the remarks that have been made with some passion and knowledge of the country by Members who have already spoken .
Let us finish the legislative procedure during the next three months .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this report , because I believe it will go a long way towards creating the competition that the European electronic communication industry really needs .
However , we know that there is many a slip &apos; t@@ wi@@ x@@ t cu@@ p and lip and that a recommendation to the Commission does not necessarily mean that the Commission , as a collegi@@ ate body , will accept it .
Bro@@ ader and more targeted sanctions form an important part of such a position and a worldwide arms embargo and the release of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi is to be welcomed .
The list of destroyed projects has recently been updated by the Commission office in Jerusalem , in coordination with the EU Member State representative offices in Jerusalem and Ram@@ al@@ lah .
I thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his very succ@@ inc@@ t and useful analysis of the situation .
First , the benefits from efforts to reduce errors need to be weighed against the costs .
Would it be possible to use this new policy to restore agricultural biodiversity ?
He set food security , and the EU contributing more to food production in the world , as his top objectives in rev@@ am@@ ping the CAP .
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain , Ireland and the United Kingdom .
The Court did not say that this was wrong in itself ; it said it is wrong to refuse it under certain circumstances , so we need to look at that very carefully .
Sadly , they will not go to Paris or Frankfurt , but instead further afield : to New York and Singapore .
In recent years a steady stabilisation in the region has taken place , not least thanks to the region &apos; s European perspective , with the ultimate goal being EU membership once the conditions have been met by every country .
At the beginning , we heard great ideas from the Spanish Presidency on asylum , migration , the Anti @-@ Discrimination Directive and the em@@ anci@@ p@@ ation of women , but I must say that , with five weeks to go , I wonder where the concrete results and proposals are .
The success of the Irish minister at the Transport Council has been documented here .
While it is under@@ stated , rather than over@@ stated , you have made progress in a calm way because we had lower expectations .
The Commissioner said earlier that it is difficult to protect workers while ensuring free movement of services ; but , regardless of how difficult it is , we must do so .
Section 6 of this document states : &apos; it is not clear that all the information provided on food labels is really helpful to consumers . &apos;
That will take place from 28 June to 5 July in Geneva , so we will share this somehow with our friends the Swe@@ des , because that is the time when we , the Cz@@ ech@@ s , will hand over the Presidency to our friends in Stockholm .
That is why public financing has to act counter @-@ cyclic@@ ally and that is why , even in Europe , we have had that kind of example .
Thirdly , a balanced form of flexicurity needs to be built around the principles included in paragraph 15 of this report , and those principles need to be incorporated into an amended guideline package .
The appeal of the abhorrent forces of knee @-@ jerk nationalism on the far right may widen .
Their quic@@ k@@ est fix is to use their lower exchange rates to flood our markets .
Never was that more highlighted than with the Services Directive .
But of course the devil is in the detail .
We have demonstrated that by peti@@ tioning citizens can get an item debated on the floor of the European Parliament and that the Commission will come to Parliament , as indeed it came to the Petitions Committee .
I believe there will be three sets of winners as a result of introducing the euro .
Firstly , more risk @-@ sensitive regulatory capital requirements , which are closer in line with banks &quot; own practices ; secondly , an enhanced supervisory review process to ensure a closer fit of these new requirements ; and , thirdly , disclosure requirements which improve transparency and market discipline .
We also support an agreement to facilitate the procedures for issuing short @-@ stay visas and on readmission between the European Community and Georgia , and we are satisfied with the post @-@ conflict assistance package , which is operating well .
The Commission is well aware of the situation and this is why we have always supported the attempt to raise the funds available up to EUR 1 billion .
British tablo@@ id newspapers are always critici@@ zing the European Union .
Of course MEPs including myself will want to see better targets , more effective targets .
in writing . - Men &apos; s violence against women is a violation of women &apos; s human rights which both reflects and reinforces inequalities between men and women .
Mr President , I want to deplore the deeply worrying decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday to close the Democracy Society Party , which represents largely Kurdish interests , and to ban from politics its leading MPs .
Without such a protocol in force , it would be hard for the IAEA to assure itself that there was no undeclared nuclear activity in Iran .
In terms of ST@@ AR@@ T , the progress we have seen between the United States and Russia on de@@ militarisation is to be welcomed and I believe will pave the way for better coordination with NATO , which was certainly the objective that the Secretary @-@ General has set himself .
President @-@ in @-@ Office , thank you for the answer .
I voted &apos; for &apos; in the hope that the ice has broken up .
I met with 50 tribal leaders , upwards of 20 000 Mar@@ sh Arabs , and I reviewed and inspected extensively hospitals and primary health clin@@ ics in Bas@@ ra , Al @-@ A@@ mara and other smaller towns and villages .
It is time that the Council put the EU &apos; s common values ahead of Member States &apos; individual commercial interests in that country .
We must ensure that we maximise funding under the seventh and eighth EU research and technology framework programmes between now and 2020 .
The debate following the departure of Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was taken forward by Mr P@@ ist@@ elli , who spoke of the European Union being like a family .

Two further aspects of the statement have given rise to much comment .
I would like to set three questions .
Malta has offered to host a secretariat to overview the implementation of such proposals and I fully endorse this offer , not only because of the unique geographical position of the island in the Mediterranean but also because we have the infrastructure , personnel and experience to host such an institute .
I have no doubt that over the years there have been abuses of Tam@@ ils and that on occasion security forces have acted with insufficient regard for ordinary Tamil people in the areas of conflict .
Human rights are universal and indivisible : the EU is committed to upholding these rights .
This runs counter to their leader David Cameron &apos; s explicit commitment to banning dangerous chemicals .
This initiative addresses acts like hac@@ king , denial @-@ of @-@ service attacks , and the spread of viru@@ ses .
Firstly , no 50 gram@@ mes , which goes against the need to create actual competition .
In recent years , the world has been tragically hit by disasters such as tsun@@ am@@ is , earthquakes in Pakistan and the recent flooding in Bangladesh .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , in view of the second Roma Summit , I would like to share with you a couple of ideas in the hope that they will take effect as soon as possible .
I promise you that every time I go on television I will call you beforehand , so you can take note of how much time I spend on television and how many hours I spend here !
I want to say a word about the new Commissioner and I hope it does not embarr@@ ass her .
The very high attendance testi@@ fies to the great importance attached by partners to the Asia @-@ Europe relationship as ASEM enters its second decade .
For all these reasons , my colleagues in Fine Gael and I will be supporting our Government .
It is easy simply to dismiss the chance of success of these projects .
We still have work to do and ambitions that remain un@@ fulfilled .
We have already hosted a meeting of senior officials from around the world and from the big financial institutions to discuss what we might be able to contribute if asked , and will , but in consultation with our neighbourhood , we have to do more to support resources coming together more effectively .
Clearly these investments are not appropriate for everyone , at least until their awareness of the risks they carry are fully understood and appreciated .
Israel has a responsibility to bring Palestine to independent statehood .
This means a unanimous vote , but there is no unanimity .
This is an important question about building a Europe for the people and when people are refused reductions because they are not residents of a particular Member State this is very damaging to the whole image of Europe .
When the details of this and other directives are considered I hope we can have at the back of our minds the mother tra@@ iling two or three irrit@@ able children around the supermarket . She does not have time to read a detailed data sheet .
This shows that there is a problem of mis@@ match between the supply and demand for labour .
If Mr B@@ ig@@ li@@ ardo would like to substanti@@ ate his claim in more detail , I should be pleased to receive his letter and answer it .
It is somewhat more difficult than that because the whole committee has been conscious that new network operators , new entrants , can be very substantial and influential players in their own country or on a global scale .
My answer is that if the Member States have Memor@@ anda of Understanding and bilateral agreements , they may be able to give data on their own nationals .
I thank the majority of Members that have given us support in this very difficult situation .
He talked about these people wanting a &quot; privileged &quot; position .
We will also have to revise how we use our financial resources .

Shor@@ tly we will have four hem@@ ic@@ y@@ cles .
I am concerned that he has agreed to a period of reflection on the Constitution .
With regard to passenger data , Mr Clarke insisted on legal safeguards against abuse , but we all know that the PNR agreement with the US lacks precisely that .
. - We are not able or willing to add or sub@@ tr@@ act anything from the internationally @-@ established Cairo consensus .
In this regard , I ask the House to take serious note of the fact that the profession of farming is in decline .
I appreciate the commitment that Mr de Roo has shown to this issue .
However , I am prepared to compromise on a reduced frequency of the strategic monitoring , bi@@ annual instead of annual .
I happen to believe that it is essential to maintain the flexibility of the commitology procedure .
in writing . - I welcome Mr Cappato &apos; s report on the state of human rights in the world in 2007 and the EU &apos; s policy in this area .
What we are seeing now is a dangerous spiral .
For instance , OLAF has been extremely operational in several cases , in the Philip Morris operation and in the Di@@ abo@@ lo fight against counterfeit operations , and this cannot happen without cooperation at European level and cannot happen without support from specific Commission services .
I can only say that a majority in this House is ready to support the proposals you are making .
We must be clear in our own minds that food security is an integral part of our European national security and the primary public benefit of the CAP which is worth paying for in its own right .
I apologize for speaking primarily about the situation in Great Britain .
Now we cannot allow that to happen in the future .
Where I think we must be careful , however , is in recognising that the many elements which need to come into play to provide a satisfactory response to the climate change challenge - from emission caps to financing - cannot be translated into provisions in our trade agreements .
However , driving down workers &quot; rights , wages and health and safety measures has no part in creating a dynamic service sector and that is why I will be voting for amendments that exclude labour law and free collective bargaining from the scope of the directive .
I sincerely hope that this House , and every Member in it , will support you in writing to Nigeria in the hope that such sentences will be stopped in the future , so that this barbaric method of killing someone under Sharia law is taken up with the Nigerian Government and the latter urged to ensure that it never happens again .
I can assure Parliament that the Commission will continue to maintain an active watch on events in Macao , especially those regarding democratic principles and human rights .
The report refers to sharing the experience gained by PEACE with other regions facing similar problems .
Mr President , the original English text was never translated .
The EU @-@ Canada Air Transport Agreement was initialled on 30 November 2008 , endorsed by the EU @-@ Canada summit on 6 May 2009 and signed on 17 @-@ 18 December 2009 .
I believe it is a balanced package : the environment will be protected , the water quality of our citizens will be increased , and the burden on the economy will be reasonable - and I think that is also important .
Firstly , prior authorisation .
On land registers , the report favours improving access to standardised information , as well as supporting further work on the European L@@ and Information Service .
Sto@@ ck management issues are also important .
I understand that concern , but the rapid reaction facility does not create new responsibilities , it tries to get better mi@@ le@@ age out of what we already have .
In Europe , 16 % of citizens still live below the poverty line .
Other difficult questions , such as the question of the return of cultural goods , were also discussed .
Then there are multilateral dialogues : we have to bring in OP@@ EC ; we have to speak more with OP@@ EC and with the Gulf Cooperation Council .
It will not come as a surprise to you when I say that the discussions on Ukraine were long , intense and very frank .
For far too long PE has been a minor subject , particularly in primary schools , and lessons are often cancelled at the first whi@@ ff of rain .
It should be about what works .
40 million new jobs need to be created in the coming decade just to keep employment levels where they are now .
What was surprising was the sheer aud@@ acity exhi@@ b@@ ited by this individual in provoc@@ atively arrang@@ ing a generous pay increase for his gir@@ l@@ friend , and even more surprising was the sham@@ eless way in which he fought to stay in office , despite the worldwide out@@ cry against him .
Macedonia is a candidate .
However , for as long as the EU is the competent authority , help for redundant workers must , apparently , come from this fund .

He described the Council as being &apos; better than expected and worse than hoped for &apos; .
At the request of the Council and the Presidency , the Commission has organised a public consultation which ended last week .
On behalf of the Socialist group , I commend this report to the Commission and Parliament as an important new consumer measure .
Subject : Waste management in Greece
I welcome the fact that in the last month the Commissioner has authorised her representatives to hold discussions with Syria &apos; s ministries for Foreign Affairs and Economic Affairs and that this week the European Parliament will offer the prospect of signing the association agreement if Syria genuinely chooses to work with Europe to achieve peace in the Middle East .
Mr President , last Friday Mr Eri@@ c T@@ ab@@ arly , a very distinguished French y@@ ach@@ tsman , was kno@@ cked over@@ board in heavy seas off the Welsh coast and is missing , presum@@ ed dro@@ w@@ ned .
We need to safeguard the existing requirements in terms of workers &apos; rights and environmental protection when transposing the IMO Convention .
It was the result of an unprecedented unilateral concession made by the European Union , and a logical step given our commitment to the development of these countries .
The previous presidency had given its commitment to resolving the matter .
If they are prevented by some unavoidable catastrophe that is a breach of democracy , but if they do not bother coming , they do not deserve the vote .
It is a somewhat curious fact that the Conference of Presidents waited so long to put this report on our plenary agenda .
Most people are now acting as their own travel agents with online boo@@ king on sites such as Tri@@ pad@@ vi@@ sor , where they effectively become their own travel agent .
Indeed , I believe he even took the wheel when going to Dun@@ o@@ on on one occasion .

For example , aviation in the UK contributes GBP 10.@@ 2 billion a year to the UK GDP and generates and supports 380 000 indirect and induc@@ ed UK jobs .
Our group wanted to have some flexibility .
Instead the EU , like a w@@ ol@@ f in sheep &apos; s clothing , is cover@@ tly abandoning cooperation and compromise in favour of consolidation .
It must be said with regard to Israel that at the moment at best it is not being as cooperative as it could be in providing full details on the origin of all products and their component parts to customs authorities .
As well as in the European Parliament , Fair Trade products are available in many Council buildings , te@@ a and coffee served at meetings is Fair Trade and awareness days have been held to inform staff about the benefits of Fair Trade .
They are particularly important in terms of socially useful employment and it is an omission that they are missing from the report .
I heard particularly disturbing news through the newspapers recently that Pan A@@ m may be resur@@ rec@@ ted as a different company but maintain the same name .
There are , however , a number of recommendations for new European measures in this report which we are unable to accept .
I am afraid that , then , we will give a message which will mean a split between the big and small countries , and this will undermine any dream of unity , fairness and inclusion .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , as others have mentioned , Canada is indeed a solid trading partner for the EU .
For instance , Latvia is suffering a deep economic crisis and it has faced severe budget cuts in the country &apos; s 34 higher education institutions with a threatened 50 % cu@@ t@@ back to the higher @-@ education budget .
This was , and is , an extraordinary event .
In that sense the agreement is an opportunity as much as an achievement .
We cannot expect real lasting peace in the region unless they are able to play their full and proper part in the dialogue .
Our people need to be assured that Europe is part of the solution , and not part of the problem , when it comes to tackling the issues raised by globalisation , demographic change , climate change and other global challenges .
We wanted to guarantee the rights of disabled people and psychological assistance .
My point is simply that I think that , if we do this in an intelligent and coherent manner , it would be possible to choose tools that could , at the same time , benefit climate change and emissions reductions , energy efficiency , energy security , and innovation and job creation .
This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur .
We reject the figure of 10 million animals slaughtered because farmers have only claimed for 6.5 million and this is a fant@@ asy figure being used for political gain .
EU fisheries investments can be found in many countries .
I think Parliament was right after long negotiations to take the position that we would like to confirm and get clear commitments from both the Council and the Commission that Parliament &apos; s rights are met .
The pilot project is an excellent idea .
Mr President , in January and March we witnessed mass atrocities in Nigeria which caused the deaths of several hundred people , including women and children .
Pi@@ g prices and sheep prices have collapsed .
The test has not been passed .

I also attended the WTO talks in Seattle with a view to promoting the ideas that you refer to , that is the involvement of , and the provision of a voice for , civil society , NGOs and consumers generally in the talks surrounding the whole WTO issue .
We look towards enlargement and encourage good practice , yet here in our institutions we still continue to discriminate .
In relation to disarmament : do we want to include Hamas militias in the Palestinian security and police forces ?
With 1.2 million volunteers in Scotland - with its population of 5 million - and the voluntary sector amounting to 5 % of Scotland &apos; s workforce , we must publicly recognise volunteers &apos; efforts throughout Scotland and the EU .

Inevitably you meet representatives from the developing countries that we are talking about and often others , sometimes Members of Parliament , who make the suggestion that perhaps the European Union is putting in place precautionary barriers in place of tariff barriers .
Today &apos; s news from Hong Kong in this regard is not good .
What will now happen is that we have two Community instruments fighting against each other .
Its aim , of course , is to improve confidence between Member States as the delivery of asylum systems improves on the basis of the practical cooperation between experts , the training and everything else involved .
Whatever it was , it went straight into the wa@@ ste@@ paper bas@@ ket and no reply was sent back to Brussels .
I must , however , reiterate concerns that I have raised repeatedly about earmarking , which remains central to the Commission &quot; s guidelines .
With some success to our name , thanks to the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control , and the opportunity to achieve even more in the coming months in the context of the 1997 discharge , the great majority of my Group want the Commission to get on with its work for Agenda 2000 .
This will constitute an important and additional forum for communicating our messages .
He had discussions with the preliminary government and the presidents of each of the three newly established com@@ missions and met with civil @-@ society representatives .
The answer is very simple : to deny the British people a say on this matter .
A number of amendments from the political groups and the committees have tried to make this clear .
Mr B@@ ini S@@ mag@@ hi seems to imply that the pact &quot; s own rigi@@ di@@ ties led to certain Member States breaking its rules and that the politics of the S@@ G@@ P made sensible economics impossible .
We had a very good example where your colleague , Commissioner Vivi@@ en Reding , Commissioner for Information and Media , took a very tough stand with the mobile phone companies - and we can see the result to the benefit of the consumer .
We must exploit knowledge to promote growth .
Through its framework research programmes the Commission has supported diabetes research in the past .
Finally , I should just like to reiterate my recent call for Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock to intervene once again in the matter of ensuring that the French authorities pay up outstanding claims by national road haulage associations arising as a direct consequence of the blockade of French motor@@ ways last year .
My final point concerns the accession countries .
It states that the Presidency is aware of the ambitious intentions of the Commission in this regard ; it welcomes these and supports the objectives . It can confirm that it is willing to do its utmost to make sure that this alignment is concluded as soon as possible once proposals by the Commission have been submitted .
Member of the Commission . - First of all , I would also like to apologise to the interpreters but I am in a somewhat exceptional situation .
Firstly , what is the history of the culpable recycling feed mil@@ l in terms of compliance with EU regulations ?
I also thank the scientific community , which was not slow in giving us advice and in pointing out that its needs were for simplicity , faster administration and financial care .
We have some - we can improve ours .
Mr President , in August the Norwegian fre@@ i@@ ghter T@@ amp@@ a rescu@@ ed 4@@ 33 Afgh@@ ans and four Indonesian crew members from a fishing vessel that had set sa@@ il from an Indonesian port .
Firstly at national level : those countries that have said &apos; no &apos; or that risk saying &apos; no &apos; must be able to think and tell the rest of the European Union how they see the way forward , what adjustments they think are necessary .
But it is equally important to bring the governments of the Member States along with us , because , as has been seen from the use of Article 235 , certain governments felt this was an imposition on them , and that it interf@@ ered with their democratic rights under the rules of subsidiarity within the Treaties .
We have to implement the European Citizens &apos; Initiative over the course of the next year .
Due to the result of the vote , he chose not to pursue it by introducing it in plenary and I am doing so on behalf of my committee .
For that reason , we propose that up to 15 years of the use can be outside the Community .
Unfortunately , as China &apos; s predominantly bilateral approach to Africa runs counter to the EU &apos; s primarily multilateral approach , the EU is being somewhat left behind .
This approach was endorsed by the European Council ; I see , though , that the Committee on Legal Affairs does not entirely share this assessment .
Its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union can be expected in March .
In addition to challenging the rationale for this Treaty , we have also been very critical of the process that brought us to this stage .
That is the first reason .
What should be the priorities ?
The W@@ FP only expects to deliver food r@@ ations to 110 000 people , 10 % of the worst @-@ affected area &apos; s 1.2 million .

Of course , I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the Green Paper on the review of the common fisheries policy , which is all important , particularly to my own country .
Coming from an agricultural area in Ireland , it is sad to see that in recent times farmers have turned against the EU project for various reasons , one of which is the perceived lack of transparency of negotiations in the Council .
Both must be mutual and complementary .
She took an opposing view and once the committee had adopted the report she asked Mr F@@ ayo@@ t to present it .
We therefore support Amendments Nos 66 and 67 , as it seems to the Commission that good work has been done here .
The timing of an agreement is critical to its success .
A lot has been done , but there is still a lot to do .
Without it , the railways are at a handicap , particularly in relation to air travel .
Do you not know that the discarded fish are dead when they are thrown back ?
Mr Barroso , you and your team have shown a willingness to listen to the concerns of this Parliament .
The President @-@ in @-@ Office has answered my question about how under@@ cutting can be prevented in Europe between EU Member States when they are selling arms to a third country , but perhaps the President @-@ in @-@ Office would like to consider the question of end use which has often created problems in the past in tracing the eventual recipient country .
The mos@@ quito responsible for trans@@ mitting malaria has proved extremely resili@@ ent to the various methods of dealing with it down the years .
It varies from culture to culture .
If it did exercise it in any piece of legislation that I was responsible for , I would take full account of that .
The court heard that the problems for many survivors is that they can never have a chance to say good@@ bye to their relatives .

Terr@@ orists can be financed by a series of small payments below the threshold .
Those words not only fit the tenor of that time , but I think they have proven to be true - and they are no less true today .
Effici@@ ent cooperation between the institutions should make it possible to adopt this proposal in a single reading .
I am very grateful for your statement in September recognizing that children and young people may well be understood to be legally citizens under the European Union , but we want to have clarification on this important issue of the development of the single European market and on whether those bad effects on children can be mitigated by proper action at European level .
In order to achieve this we want more transparency , better regulation , a renov@@ ated and functioning grid , a European energy strategy , debate on self @-@ sufficiency and solidarity between Member States , and rules that enable consumers to decide on their own consumption in a workable way .
The quantitative , as well as qualitative , returns that the EU would reap as a result of its commitment to training are un@@ questionable .
I have one brief question .
When I say the position of lawyers , I mean not just lawyers but also their clients and their clients &quot; access to justice .
By his own standards , Mr Milosevic has learned the lessons of Bosnia and is applying them .
. Madam President , I welcome this motion for a resolution , which highlights the detrimental effect that high fuel prices are having on the fishing industry , resulting in job losses and severe problems in fishing communities .
When the OECD is forecasting in its annual employment outlook , published last Monday , a deterioration in the levels of employment in European countries such as France and Germany over the next 18 months , can the Council really be arguing that Europe should carry on the same policies regardless of the results , in the hope - not in the reasoned expectation , but the hope - that things will somehow turn out to be all right ?
I would examine this during the deliberations of the forthcoming Health Council in Slovenia , and I would also make another addition to this suggestion : that I would like to see representatives of patients and of professionals included in this task force .
Either we create space for a European dimension in knowledge and the transfer of knowledge and we improve together or , as I said before , we will lose time and momentum .
The proposals for training on a healthy diet have already attracted widespread ridi@@ cule in the British press .
Other measures that could be considered are supplementary investment aid for farmers under 40 , production rights , assistance with credit terms , better education , training and networking opportunities - one could go on .
Finally , I hope that in our committee , we will be able to stop fighting each other and get on with fighting fraud .
I particularly welcome the comment that whilst healthcare is a matter for Member States , nonetheless we can all learn a great deal from each other .
I am happy to announce that S@@ ch @-@ eval , the Schengen Evalu@@ ation Group has now found that Bulgaria has done that work .
This mission has troops coming from Sweden , the Netherlands , Poland , Austria and Ireland .
I know that it is a particular problem for the United Kingdom , but it is not exclusive to the United Kingdom .
The Commission and Europe can act as the honest broker in bringing together these sides to ensure that we deliver the best possible remedies for people within the European Union .
Over the past year , the Commission has made a major contribution to approxim@@ ating the legal frameworks of Member States in this work .
At one time , the Chinese authorities paid heed to our resolutions , but no more .
Our rebate will never be given up until the CAP is radically reformed , with the funds freed up , used to address modern priorities like research and development , combating climate change and external action funding to stabilise the Western Balkans , help Eastern European countries like Ukraine and fle@@ dg@@ ling democracies in the Middle East such as Iraq .
I would also reiterate the point that the British Muse@@ um tru@@ ste@@ es are the appropriate body with whom these discussions should be taken forward , rather than it being a matter for national governments in the first instance .
I therefore welcome and support calls for policies to encourage greater economic participation by women with the aim of further improving their status and boosting their income and assets .
Therefore it is most important that these funds reach real people who need help .

Mr President , we could go on all night discussing rural development , agricultural subsidies , gender equality , land reform , increased ODA as part of rural development and so on , but I am sure you would not want us to , even though those serious issues deserve our full attention .

We now have an opportunity to strengthen the partnership between Tunisia and the European Union on the basis of an affirm@@ ation of democracy and economic and social reform .
I share Parliament &apos; s concern over the slow implementation of internal market directives .
Already in 1967 , 1977 , and again in 1992 , at the time of the introduction of the internal market , the Council decided to authorise the Member States concerned to maintain these derogations .
The Commission highlighted in its communication of 9 February &apos; W@@ inning the battle against climate change &quot; that we should focus on leadership by example .
If the answer is that we have to address , because of the urgency , some of the issues that are inside the already agreed financial period , then I am sure that area of science and research would be one of the candidates that needed to be addressed .
It should be a useful means of ensuring that the aviation industry plays its part in the fight against climate change .
I have not seen that yet .
C@@ loser coordination between the Commission and Member States is needed and Parliament therefore supports the development of joint strategy papers .
We have gone through the implications of it , we have gone through the reasons that it occurred and whatever else .

That matter has always been an issue of dialogue with our American partners .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , although the issue does not fall within in my portfolio , I feel privileged to substitute for my good friend and colleague Jacques Barrot , and to participate in this debate , because I am convinced that this is a very important issue .
I would also support the call for Member States to urgently ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Be@@ ings .
I am much more optimistic than the rapporteur .
Our task is to bring an end to the crisis for all those affected and not , as the British Government seem to be doing , continue down paths which deepen rather than solve problems .
Therefore , procedures to improve security standards must be put in place as a matter of urgency .
Jer@@ zy Buzek has therefore received the absolute majority of the votes cast .
I want local economic development to be first in line when European programmes are planned , managed and implemented .
Whether it is timely or not is , of course , a matter that should be looked at by Parliament itself .
It is a shame that Conservative MEPs sided with the mobile phone industry to oppose consumer protection , making the case for higher charges to be levied .
Not to mention the enormous amount of paperwork that is translated into 20 different languages and not to mention that approximately half the European Parliament &quot; s budget for running costs is spent on interpretation and translation .

Parliament was represented , I was present , and I think you struck exactly the right note for Parliament .
The funds : I am pleased to say that actually , these are very well @-@ run funds . They are managed through the UN or through the World Bank and I think honourable Members receive a state of play report .
Mr President , we debate these subjects under the general heading of urgencies and some people would argue that land mines are not exactly an urgent problem because they will be with us for many years .
On the question of the so @-@ called golden rule on investment , we can support references to Article 104 ( c ) in the relevant paragraphs within the multilateral surveillance proposition .
The interpretation and application of the law is being further harmonised and staffing levels in the judicial system are increasing .
Let me note that it does not make much difference whether we talk about partnerships or deals .
When a society like Turkey experiences fundamental political changes , it is rarely the case that there is always full clarity or a direction ami@@ d@@ st events .
However , there is not yet reliable information on the impact of corrective actions , and the Court concluded that corrective actions cannot yet be considered effective in mitig@@ ating errors .
Sir Leon mentioned the need for closer cooperation between regulatory authorities but I would respectfully suggest that competition is a rather different matter .
So , to summarise : in the Commission &apos; s view the Court of Auditors &apos; annual report for 2007 shows that there is steady , gradual progress .
The warning bel@@ l is r@@ inging on the DDA .
Many more internationally @-@ recognised refugees need a fair chance for a new life , and I find it incredible that the Council and Commission try to prevent Parliament from exercising its parliamentary rights .
Thirdly , we want to see a rein@@ statement of the 20 % reduction proposed by the Commission in sustainable mobility .
Will it interfere with the rights of people who are unhappy with the status quo and want to change things ?
No Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge leaders has ever been tried and only two are in detention , one being the person who ran a notorious torture centre in Phnom Penh from which only seven out of more than four@@ teen thousand inmates emerged alive .
We must first make sure that existing legislation in the same field is being implemented across the European Union .
I have my criticisms of the Treaty of Nice , but it is important that we be brave enough to say , &quot; Of course , we have problems , but it is important that the enlargement process gets under way &quot; .
Let me conclude by saying that I shall move a revised oral amendment to a foot@@ note in my report in order to take away any excuse for those who oppose free movement on a nationalistic , racist or xenophobic basis , but who do not dare to declare it openly , to vote against my report .
And I am convinced that a solution similar to free allocation under the Emissions Trading System can be included in the ET@@ D revision .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , I had the pleasure a few weeks ago of meeting some of the UK returning forces from Afghanistan and I heard the same story over and over again that they were ill @-@ equipped .

Mr President , computer entrepreneurs are amongst the most independent spirits in the world .
We need these extra resources to repeat the successes , like the extension of the primary health care system to 80 % of Afgh@@ ans - including far better treatment for women and girls - and recent success in turning provinces poppy free .
I have yet to meet a business operator who would admit that he or she does not know the origin of the ingredients he or she is using .
This is also a very good instrument that we have in addition to mere dialogue .
In whatever walk of life , we must work together : there is no cherry @-@ picking , there is no free ri@@ ding in the real world .
Firstly , the question of the non @-@ parties : I think there are three states which have so far refused to adhere to the treaty .

We believe when it comes to matters of food safety the European Union should adhere to the precautionary principle .
I can assure them that we will vigorously oppose that tomorrow .

Then will come the withdrawal of UN@@ T@@ A@@ ET and the declaration of independence .
The expectation of many was that there would be such leadership on budgetary questions .
Finally , I would point out that it was always through the Lebanon that many of the contacts were made with the other Middle Eastern countries .
Moreover , this provision already exists in current legislation .
It would need to be accompanied by a reform to the Special Administrative Region &apos; s political institutions .
Those expectations are confirmed by public opinion polls .
So we foresee that this could be presented to the college on 5 May .
What is it about you , Mr Verhofstadt ?
The president was forced to flee , accused of corruption and ste@@ aling the election .
However , 6 % of people who contract SARS will die .

We have here legislation that will make a real impact on the lives of the 12 to 14 million third country nationals living in the European Union and the 4 million black Europeans .
Clearly a significant downturn in fishing activity can be expected in the next few years , and clearly with that significant downturn in activity will come a significant downturn in the income of many families and many communities in our fishing areas , both in the catching sector and in processing .
However , the Commission will ensure , during the ongoing negotiations on the Cohesion Policy intervention for 2007 @-@ 2013 , that the specific constraints of these territories are duly taken into account in the corresponding programmes and that suitable measures are programmed to tackle them .
Of course we must patro@@ l Europe &apos; s borders .
The report explicitly supports the reopening of trade talks with the Mercosur countries .
It was aggravated by the loss of one of the processing factories due to a fire last June .
Concerning ethics , it is quite clear that we have to maintain the high ethical standards and principles that we have always followed and pay proper attention to that .
However , one must at least try to make a start to change things to some extent .
That has not happened , and the Commission has failed to enforce this Directive properly .
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us .
As regards your paper , the European Parliament and the Commission should be partners in the construction of Europe , not riv@@ als .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , as many speakers have said - and as I also mentioned - similar initiatives and proposals were tabled and actions were adopted by Parliament and the Commission before the 2006 World Cup organised in Germany .
As I see it , the practical problem is how this resolution will be perceived by the Iranian regime .
I must point out that the Commission is not bound in any way by the ES@@ C@@ B CESR standards , and any policy decisions which might be enshrined in a future directive on clearing and settlement will take precedence over the ES@@ C@@ B CESR standards .
What we are considering here is the question of animal welfare and the treatment of animals and birds in these circumstances .
We need a mixture of legislative and market @-@ based responses .
Under this bilateral track , a number of Member States initially signed a memorandum of understanding with the US .
In 2003 the Court of Auditors looked at the LIFE scheme and found that financial beneficiaries failed to keep sufficiently transparent and detailed accounts .
The question of coherence is very important .

As we have been reading in our newspapers , there have been violent confron@@ tations in refugee camps , where the bulk of the Western Saharan population have been confined since the Moroccan invasion of the 1970s .
In short we really can do a lot more together but the central point remains that the political will on the part of the Member States is sometimes used as an ali@@ bi .
Fifth is the European Union &quot; s work on global security .
I called to the attention of the Chair the fact that my machine did not work .
I have here the Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission agreed just two years ago .
Sweden , Denmark and the UK have not adopted the single currency , so they are not s@@ add@@ led with a single interest rate .
Let us carry those words through so that we really can influence what is happening in the United Nations .
I hope that you will agree with me , Commissioner , that in the current context that will be a small price to pay .
However , the people who have not been involved - as is so often the case - are the people most likely to benefit or suffer from our decisions .
We must seek to build a new peaceful world in partnership with Russia , not in opposition to it .
The British government took the view that if other states wished to go ahead on their own using the institutions and mechanisms of the European Communities then it was not Britain &apos; s place to hinder them .
Furthermore , a very limited number of posts are granted on a flexible basis , in particular in order to account for changing majorities after elections .
They are quite different and must be dealt with quite separately .
However , we are of the opinion that such an important report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs concerning a global power like China needs to be re @-@ examined and re @-@ discussed in detail .
They enjoy working extra hours .
My concern is rather that we do not currently have any standardised mechanism for making an attempt to do so .
To quote my colleague Mr Gahler , however , the US is one step behind the events , the Member States are one step behind the US , and Brussels is one step behind the Member States .
Please would you give a clu@@ e about that integrated approach ?
It seems to me that the EU should be ideally placed to be a strong spoke , if not the actual hub of that important wheel .
The term &quot; pay &quot; should continue to be defined in the national law of the Member States .
They are not obliged to be here , but we did of course expect the Court of Auditors &apos; highest representatives .
Since I took over the rapport@@ eur@@ ship of this report I have tried to involve all the interested parties from the manufacturing side right through to the user side .
So I join in supporting the compromise package which has been put forward , particularly by my distinguished colleague Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt , not least because independent observers tell me that this package is in line with the ITRE Committee &apos; s position .
As you said , we have indeed proposed a significant number of measures to promote economic development of the outermost regions in line with our communication of last year .
We need more grassroots action like that , with European Union backing .
Mr President , I very much welcome the Commission &apos; s communication and the report which Barbara Schmid@@ b@@ auer has produced on behalf of Parliament in response to that communication .
That is why - even if in theory all technologies should be equal - I still believe that the second generation is worthy of particular attention .
There is no crisis of human rights in the European Union , but there is a crisis of democratic legitimacy .

How soon can we expect a clear and definitive view on the potential or otherwise of genetic research as applied to practical farming ?
I have just been informed that Dr. Carlos Rob@@ erto Reina , the President of the Central American Parliament , and his wife have arrived in the distinguished visitors &apos; gallery .
This would facilitate greater understanding and mutual respect .
But behind the controversy about this report lies a human tragedy , the tragedy of the Palestinians who long for moderate and in@@ corrupt leaders who will bring them peace , security and prosperity through a settlement with Israel .
Mr President , just to understand , what you are telling us is that , for the vote on a Vice @-@ President , it is impossible ever not to get a qualified majority , because , if you can only vote in favour or be taken down as abstention , and if abst@@ entions do not count towards the total vote , then by definition , you always get a qualified majority .
He said at the beginning of his contribution that it would be our last opportunity to hear him .
We have to make sure that the long @-@ term commitment is there for as long as the long @-@ term risk of the nuclear facility in Chernobyl remains .
This is now EUR 400 million since 2000 , so this is quite a good amount .
I think Geneva is the place to continue talks about the political solution .
In the working group of economic govern@@ ors in the Convention of which I was a member , we had a majority of members who thought that the European Parliament and the European Commission should have a role to play and that the methods of open coordination and processes should be included in the Constitutional Treaty .
We cannot hob@@ ble that search and yet we must also uphold the dignity of the human person .
Mr President , I too want to support the application for funds from the European Commission .
Far from sending ship@@ loads of money to Eastern Europe , they would do better to make sure that the prosperity of Europe as a whole is not compromised .

However , the atmosphere this time was different .
Every day counts in this situation .
I will not speak on Japan because we now have a new item on the agenda .
More controls would be placed to prevent oil sp@@ ill@@ ages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Bis@@ c@@ ay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils .
Against this background , the report has now developed these concepts and my group will vote for it .
Nevertheless , overall GDP in the euro area increased by only 0.5 % in 2003 .
It is hard to find anyone who believes that the existing drugs policies are a success .
We asked for one month &apos; s extension , but the Council was simply unwilling to give us that extension ; and the fact that the Council is absent today , and has not been interested in talking to the European Parliament , only demonstrates that they simply do not want to involve the European Parliament ; it demonstrates their in@@ sincerity .
It is other parties that are the problem here and they will have to find out if they want an alternative , should there be one , or how they will cope with the continuation , the second commitment period .
In a common market we need to work together because we have one common interest .
We are open @-@ minded about it .
The leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia refuse to give the people the right to choose their own government and to respect elections , as has been the case in Ethiopia .
What has happened since - and Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner and I met representatives of the Sun@@ ni community and discussed the matter with members of the Shi@@ a and Kurdish communities - is an effort by the Iraqi Government to bring Sun@@ nis in .
I support the main thrust of this directive as we must strike a balance between promoting commercial enterprise and protecting European consumers at all times .

I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here .
I am quite confident that the steady progress in this area will continue under the forthcoming British presidency .

I urge anyone who has not been to L@@ ap@@ land to go and see what a real outermost region looks like .
We have rejected .
But I fail to see why it is urgent in the sense of our rules .
The two main blocks of the draft action plan are : first , the setting up of appropriate coordination machinery to ensure that Member States , the Commission and other key actors are part of the process of working towards common data @-@ gathering methods and harmonised definition ; the second element concerns the implementation of developing comparable statistics .
Perhaps the reason for this calm political talk is the fact that now it concerns not only Russia but also Ukraine , and this is not correct .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the European perspective of the Western Balkans .
The Irish Government continues to aim for top @-@ quality healthcare for its citizens , including appropriate , prompt and safe healthcare in the right setting : healthcare provided in a way that is fair to patients , taxpayers and health professionals .
It was exactly these issues I discussed very directly with the Russian Government during my visit to the region at the beginning of February .
We were told then that the Turkish authorities condemned state torture and that they were making serious efforts to respect fundamental human rights and democracy .
Madam President , now that this vote is over and the arguments have been made , I would like to come back to something that ran through the debate here and in the committee .

I am one of those who are convinced that the prospect of eventual EU membership is indispensable to driving further political reform and pushing for democracy .
Commissioner , it is within your and the Council &apos; s powers to at least take a balanced position on this and to achieve the aim over a longer term so that we do not hurt a lot of people on the way .
On non @-@ discrimination akin to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , for example , there is the right of people undergoing second line checks to have those checks conducted with dignity and , if necessary , in a non @-@ public area .
A common interinstitutional understanding can also play a significant role in this important part of the better regulation agenda .
This week &apos; s developments will make it harder than ever to relaunch the six @-@ party talks , but , in the medium to long term , this framework remains the best chance for a lasting solution .
It is more useful to look for a pan @-@ EU solution to this problem than for Member States to seek a solution individually .
It can also accept amendments which would bring forward the review of the directive and widen the scope of that review .
However , we have to say that the task force proposal keeps the semi @-@ automatic character of the sanctions and maintains the reverse majority rule that was proposed by the Commission .
We also provide for the Rules of Procedure to be re@@ written , where necessary , in gender @-@ neutral language .
It would be unfortunate if , in the end , we were bo@@ unc@@ ed into ill @-@ thought @-@ out or ill @-@ conceived solutions without due reflection and debate because this will be crucial to our effective ability to cope with enlargement - a point , again , which the Taoiseach quite correctly emphasi@@ zed as the next major challenge beyond the IGC .
I call on the Commission to act on Parliament &apos; s recommendations with urgency .
St@@ ar@@ ting off in Britain , which still has a poor recycling record , the WEEE Directive looks like the future .
I am not sure if I would have felt that I was justified in taking up the time of the House , had that been all that there was to the matter , but I want to add to the point we are discussing today .
Mr President , this report creates a depressing picture of the situation of women in some Mediterranean countries .
We as a group have always maintained that we should uphold those agreements which we have entered into .

It also rightly reiterates the role of an integrated transatlantic market by 2015 .
in writing . - Aviation should be brought within the scope of the Emissions Trading Scheme .
P@@ re @-@ election politics also got in the way of the implementation of the IMF stand@@ by arrangement , with Ukraine failing to meet required conditions .
For a medium @-@ sized slaughter@@ house killing 2,@@ 500 pigs a week , this adds £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 a year to costs , very little of which can be rec@@ ou@@ ped .
More generally , and quite apart from this specific case , I am also concerned about the environmental and human health problems related to ship breaking , in particular the implications for non @-@ OECD countries .
That is why it is important , as the previous speaker has said , that the study of minority languages should be encouraged in the Socrates programme .
If such an eventu@@ ality were to be negotiated , it would not adversely affect the wellbeing of the Turkish people ; through the establishment of long @-@ lasting stability , it would bring peace and prosperity to the whole of Turkey .
Why make the non @-@ GMO label almost un@@ ob@@ tain@@ able by speci@@ fying un@@ achievable levels of pu@@ rity ?
I would like to remind everybody that the Council and Parliament confirmed e @-@ Europe as a priority .

We are also against biometrics in European passports .
It has its logic , as so clearly explained by Mr Ger@@ bran@@ dy .
. Mr President , I have a purely technical point concerning Amendment 13 .
Amendment No 18 suggests that some financial support and incentives might be given to manufacturers .
This own @-@ initiative report of the European Parliament represents a very good basis for further discussions .
We are all in development mode and our commitment must be to drive our policy forward and faster .
It needs a shot in the arm .
It has to be adapted to the EU 2020 strategy , where raising employment is a key goal .
No other major changes were voted .
If ICAO will not deliver then the EU will have to develop its own emission limits .
I recognise that Parliament is not convinced on this .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I should like to thank Members for their comments , which have deepened and enriched my understanding of Parliament &apos; s priorities for 2011 .
Finally , I thank the European Parliament once again for its own contribution and I look forward to continuing our discussion on the regular reports in the coming months .
We in this Parliament must speak out strongly to send a clear message of condemnation of the acts of violence that have taken place and the kidnapping of a man who has gained a reputation as one of the world &apos; s leading media broadcasters .

Making a new , peaceful Europe was Monnet &apos; s greatest dream .
Are we putting forward schemes which are simple , with clear objectives , realistic to execute and whose accountability lines are clear ?
Should we close them , their members will be forced to join a larger group , thereby complic@@ ating affairs and increasing the in@@ coherence of those groups .
Do not bring in any more bureaucracy from Brussels because all you do is give everybody here a bad name , and we do some good work .
In the last year the Commission has introduced a number of qualit@@ atively new initiatives .
The guidelines now clearly express the important contribution of parliamentary bodies for improving the governance of the employment strategy .
In particular , the process through which priorities are set needs to be made more open and more transparent .
We have a situation in which Member States in the last five years have so far failed in their Treaty obligation to establish a common asylum and immigration policy offering a reassurance of orderly control of asylum and immigration , a level playing field and responsibility @-@ sharing .
The proposal before us today for an amending directive on falsi@@ fied medicines will , subject to Parliament &apos; s approval , take us into new territory .
We will raise these issues not only within the United Nations process , but also in other sett@@ ings in order to help build the necessary momentum .
