Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I should like to thank all who contributed to this interesting debate .
Could you comment briefly on the implications for the agenda this evening .
In 2004 it was , of course , the United Kingdom that bore the brunt of the EU enlargement , because it was the only one not to put up any barriers .
We must look together with Russia to a new global security arrangement or agreement .
I would like to ask the Commission to make use of Article 7 of the EU Treaty , which makes it possible to start an investigation into such incidents - I am not even talking about sanctions - but I would like there to be an investigation to see if these ministers can be held responsible for violations of fundamental rights .
It matters to me .
I would like to draw this to your attention .
I have not heard enough - either in this debate or in the committee - about that important right .
Ad@@ ded to my list is the European Commission .
I want to commend the rapporteur on a very fine report : a report that reflects the views of the vast majority of the Members of this House and , indeed , of practically all citizens of Europe .
For that reason , candidate countries are put on an equal footing with Member States in this programme , which has special objectives to meet the needs of those administrations .
. It is very important to note that this energy question shows that today we have an interdependent relationship with Russia .
The Commission therefore welcomes the report by Mr Schröder and will provide a detailed reaction to the points raised in due course .
For the sake of transparency , the programme moreover includes 150 other proposals which the Commission is working on .
In this respect , therefore , I am proposing that one of the permanent features of the Single Market forum should be to carry out an annual appraisal and audit to g@@ au@@ ge the state of play of the Single Market , primarily , whether the objectives and aims set out in the Act have been achieved or not , thus convincing European citizens that the Single Market truly represents their interests and aspirations .
At all events , I can emphasise once more on behalf of the Council that it is important to us that Parliament is regularly informed and involved regarding not only all the issues in which its involvement is a constitutional right , of course , but also all the issues concerning the functioning of this Treaty .
in writing . - The European Parliamentary Labour Party supported this resolution and gave support to underpinning the progress made last month in Pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh .
Conclu@@ ding next year would mean that the European Institute of Technology could start its work in 2008 . This should be our common goal .
I am convinced that Parliament and the Commission share the same analysis : all of us would have preferred a more ambitious compromise , especially as far as the approximation of tax rates is concerned .
I think we did a good job .
So our group will vote in favour of the report at the final vote today .
The question is whether , in this vicious circle of aggression , the present Israeli authorities are able to take the lesson from the six @-@ year year @-@ long long history in the area , and apply the sc@@ al@@ pel @-@ like like strategy for two states .
Secondly , we will not be able to continue to construct a European project , European cooperation , if we do not have people behind us , if we are not working in a democratic , open and transparent way .
Finally , the proposal will give the possibility to adopt not only directives , but also decisions or regulations , as the latter are more appropriate for certain provisions , such as lists of authorised substances .
Madam President , human trafficking is , quite rightly , a pe@@ j@@ or@@ ative term because it descri@@ bes a dis@@ g@@ usting practice .
As Mr Bertens said , Parliament supports the initiatives taken by the eight countries in the New Agenda Co@@ ali@@ tion .
The proposed European External Action Service must complement and not compete with or undermine Member States &amp; apos ; bilateral diplomatic activity and must draw its authority mainly from the Council and not from the Commission .
There also seems to be a linguistic problem surrounding the concepts of &amp; quot ; public policy &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; public order &amp; quot ; in the French and English versions .
The Commission , with the support of the scientific agencies and with the Member States , because this is a shared competence with the Member States , is committed to moving forward on these issues .
It is the responsibility of the official institutions of European Union .
Our support for international organisations , not least United Nations Women , and for civil society , will be instrumental in supporting change from within .
Europe is changing and I hope that the new President will recognise and respond to this .
On behalf of my group I would like to propose that we do not agree with the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s request to send this back to Strasbourg for voting .
We should respond to that .
Does he think that the guidelines he has adopted today can be a ra@@ ll@@ ying point for the Heads of State ?
The European policy against trafficking in human beings is a priority not only for this Parliament but also for the European Commission and myself .
It is clear that NATO will want to retain its nuclear deter@@ r@@ ents while keeping with the objective that it set itself on a nuclear @-@ free free world .
We must be aware that the eleven &amp; apos ; in &amp; apos ; countries can eventually accept , according to terms which remain to be defined , to inform their &amp; apos ; out &amp; apos ; partners .
I would certainly hope that the remit of the Safety Agency would cover responsibility for looking at the impact of new technology in many areas of aviation safety , and a capacity to make recommendations on the testing of new technology and on requiring higher safety standards to be met .
Madam President , on principle , on these matters it is very unwise to accept oral amendments however worthy they may sound .
That is why I await with interest the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals in this area , taking into account the recommendations of EFSA ( European Food Safety Authority ) and EG@@ E ( European Group on E@@ th@@ ics in Sci@@ ence and New Technology ) .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , thank you very much for this debate .
But perhaps without in any way bel@@ it@@ t@@ ling what confron@@ ts us , for &amp; apos ; crisis &amp; apos ; we should probably read &amp; apos ; challenges &amp; apos ; - challenges to Europe to really step up to the mark and fulfil its role .
This present Europe , as your presidency demonstrates , Mr Juncker , cannot work .
Not in 2011 , not in 2012 , but in 2013 , when we have the possibility to do so .
Common standards are required and perhaps it is time for the European Parliament to take the lead .
Yet they are saying to me that the EU is lagging significantly behind the US and the UK and national authorities .
The time has come to make those who engage in the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms legally responsible for damage to human health and the environment .
However , the internal market can achieve its goal only on the basis of decisions taken by European citizens .
It is proper to revisit that Directive , for example to close loopholes such as using alternative legal entities like foundations to escape its provisions .
I will only do that if I have to and will return straight away to the debate .
I welcome wholeheartedly the Commission &amp; apos ; s views .
Why is it that we congratulate ourselves on being substantial donors of aid to developing countries and , at the same time , we devise partnership agreements that force poor countries to lay b@@ are their markets to European economic ambition ?
This is obvious , so it is also obvious that Parliament , the Commission and everybody involved has shown a great deal of goodwill .
We must be able to offer industry and SMEs a better deal to ensure that the protection of intellectual property is genuinely an opportunity to create and encourage innovation .
Does the Commissioner still believe that his statement of 28 June was a necessary and sufficient answer to the concerns that have been raised ?
Perhaps it is because both the other institutions are not used to Parliament having codecision in this particular area - I am sorry , but you will have to get used to it !
However , let me stress that there are also a number of positive issues to note from the summit .
It also emphasises the good cooperation between the EU and NATO .
Much work has therefore gone , in this report , into improving and re@@ defining our legislative procedures .
The successful launch of the euro in recent days must clearly be an indication to the German Government that stability is the key to the success of European Union policies .
I might need an extra minute or two , and I shall be happy to take it .
Thirdly , we wanted the possibility of a future legal framework for the period beyond 2012 to be reflected in the text .
They have done a good , serious job .
I am proposing to table an amendment on that because , as the rapporteur knows , this is a subject particularly dear to the heart of UK Conservatives .
Nothing new , they said .
We see a similar position with the US , the Japanese and the European markets acting to some extent on their own .
As was pointed out in his report from last year , the crucial work is about building citizens &amp; apos ; trust in the EU , and we can all subscribe to that .
We need courage and imagination - imagination to fill the gaps or to clarify the ambiguities of the treaty .
To obtain access to certain basic social rights under the Staff Regulations , non @-@ married married hetero@@ sexual partners must , as indicated , have document@@ ary proof that their partnership is recognised in a Member State , they must not be married or in a non @-@ mar@@ ital mar@@ ital partnership with another person and they must have no blood relationship with their partner .
While acknowledging that the agricultural budget represents a significant proportion of the overall EU budget , it seems wrong that proposed restrictions are based more on what remains after we provide for the agreed 8 % annual increase in structural funds rather than the actual needs of European agriculture .
It must be said , given the broad range of views , that is going to be quite some challenge .
Secondly , on constitutional reform , we all know that it is both necessary and delicate .
I should like to comment on the proposed amendments .
Now we all accept that fishing activity must be limited in line with declining resources , but the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals are unfair and contradictory .
The neighbourhood policy is very important for the European Union , the Mediterranean region , the Eastern Partnership and , first and foremost , the Western Balkans .
The majority of Members of this House have agreed to a ban .
Whatever the response , the ideas that we have put forward are now a central part of the debate , a central part of the dialogue with these countries .
Does it mean that you can still suffer discrimination in the workplace if you engage in homo@@ sexual activities in your private life ?
I want to look further , at the whole situation of climate change , which cannot be overlooked , either in the short or the long term .
in writing . - I supported Parliament &amp; apos ; s decision to postpone granting discharge to the Council as I believe the Council has not provided Parliament with sufficient information regarding its accounts .
. Mr President , I welcome the interest of the honourable Members of the European Parliament in the human rights issues in our neighbourhood , in particular in Egypt and in the case of Mr Ay@@ man N@@ our .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the next EU @-@ United United States summit .
Gebhardt Report ( A5 @-@ 0317 0317 / 2000 )
As I have just said , the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal was a response to a parliamentary resolution in which Parliament made use of its new powers under Article 192 of the Treaty on European Union .
If money has been given to the government through budgets and not spent in an appropriate manner the people will know and will report .
The situation is of doubtful legality , but the Commission is in discussions with the American Government to try and rectify .
We have to answer to the public on the legislation that we produce in Parliament , and we cannot afford to be complacent about risks to children &amp; apos ; s health .
Your concessions on state aid and public procurement are reasonable , alongside your commitment to accompany them with the structural reforms laid down in the Lisbon Strategy .
I would like to congratulate Mr Simpson on the report and thank Parliament for this debate .
I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent support and cooperation on this file .
We will continue to review the extent to which the instruments of human rights clauses , sanctions and dialogue - all of which have been scrutinised extensively by this Parliament - can play an effective role as part of our overall external policy , whilst ensuring the highest standards of respect for human rights .
In particular , I want to stress the importance of the amendment to remove the reference in the report and in the Commission proposals to the right of Member States to ex@@ pel third country nationals , not only if they represent a threat to public order or public security but also if they represent a threat to Member States &amp; apos ; international relations .
I am encouraged by the first exchange of views with the European Council .
Second , I would like to stress that special procedures are at the core of the United Nations human rights machinery , playing a critical role , especially in the Human Rights Council , civil society and democratic states .
This directive obliges the operators and masters of vessels carrying dangerous or polluting goods to provide the competent authorities of the Member State of destination or of departure with detailed information about the ship &amp; apos ; s intended route and c@@ argo .
If we were to favour a minimum rate , I suspect we would lose valuable support from both Member States and business , which will , after all , be the major beneficiaries of a common consolidated corporate tax base .
Hopefully , things will go in the right direction .
Any difficulty , even temporary , that has the effect of reducing supplies of energy from third states also causes serious disturbances in the economic activity of the Union .
The submission of a draft law setting up an independent human rights institution and the much awaited anti @-@ corruption corruption strategy , adopted in principle by the Turkish Government on 21 January , are also promising .
The honourable Member may rest assured that this forms only part of our overall deliber@@ ative process and does not in any way commit the Commission to making a proposal one way or the other .
I believe that I am proposing a balanced solution that deserves the backing of Member States and this House .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , the negotiations with Croatia have entered an important and demanding phase .
Madam President , Greece , a long @-@ standing standing Member of the EU , and its 11 million citizens , do consider that they have a serious and legitimate problem with the name of their neighbour , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , and we have to respect that concern .
Let us ask ourselves whether this is ambitious .
I hope that sooner or later we will do that .
I shall try to concentrate on a small number of topics , which are very important .
I believe that our proposals offer that .
On the contrary , they can help us and we urge India to also be proactive in the coming Poz@@ na@@ ń Conference to prepare post @-@ Kyoto Kyoto and in the negotiations on an agreement in Copenhagen .
My last point concerns Amendment No 7 .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , I consider the Committee on Petitions one of the most valuable committees in Parliament , if not the most valuable .
Therefore , that particular issue is there because it affects a large number of people .
Let me now say a word on human rights .
Mr President , I had hoped that the extra time taken by the Commission to fine @-@ tune tune the proposals would have resulted in documents which would fully reflect the concerns raised by this House when we adopted our opinion earlier this year .
Rules for trade are needed , but I will not be sorry if consumer preference s@@ lows the pace of GMO development and allows us more time to assess the full consequences of their use .
We were discussing earlier in this forum how important that is .
I ask people to reflect overnight and when we come tomorrow to vote in the light of the Commission &amp; apos ; s opinion , to give to those charged to represent this House the widest , most thorough mandate possible to say : &amp; apos ; This is what is available ; this what we bring forward ; and this commands the support of a great majority of Parliament &amp; apos ; .
That is a quote from their report .
Seppänen report ( A5 @-@ 03@@ 50 03@@ 50 / 2001 )
This is not true ; we are anti the European Union .
On the other hand , it is important that we insist that the results of the inquiries on all the deaths should be made public and the responsibilities made clear .
Europe is not an end in itself .
I hope the Commission will resist in bringing forward legislative proposals as it is only right and proper that the industry should be given sufficient time to implement fully this agreement .
A@@ m I correct in thinking that the European Commission has now changed its views on its own competences ?
Thanks to your per@@ sever@@ ance , and not least to the personal contributions of Professor Trakatellis and of Vice @-@ President President Im@@ ben@@ i , a realistic agreement was reached in the conciliation procedure .
Madam President , I will state my point briefly and simply .
This proposal improves upon the 2004 Directive ( 2004 / 18 / EC ) currently in force by increasing flexibility , transparency and , vitally , fair competition .
I suppose it is not entirely a coincidence , given that today , 8 March , is International Women &amp; apos ; s Day , but , in any case , we welcome your initiatives in this regard .
It amounts to an abuse of authority .
Point 5 ( j ) . The main guidelines of the code of conduct governing the behaviour and operation of the new Commission have already been endorsed by my team .
All these issues impress on us the need for an end to this crisis , which has been going on for nearly 30 years .
We will be working hard to do that , but we will see when we meet here at the end of our Presidency whether we have been successful or not .
In other words , the fish that can be caught sustainably , beyond what local fishermen can themselves catch .
It needs to be a shared endeavour between the Council , the Presidency and Parliament .
Europe that is unified and prosperous , peaceful and attractive .
In addition , for the first time in the Commission &amp; apos ; s report they also highlight the fact that the European Union is largely an internal trading community .
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997 , the work on the draft M@@ L@@ A Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997 .
I wish to put on record , as someone who has a long @-@ standing standing interest in that policy question , that I ask whether I am entitled to receive a copy of the written and oral submissions which were made on behalf of the House on an issue which is of grave concern to many Members .
I voted &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; on the first vote and &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; on the second vote .
By the Commission &amp; apos ; s own admission a new protocol was not negotiated because a scientific survey had not been conducted .
The use of innovative financing needs to be approached with caution , and the moves by the EU to leverage its own budget need to be taken into account , knowing all the risks and the potential for moral hazard .
However , I recognize that we have serious ethical considerations in this directive .
President , speaking on Mr De M@@ el@@ o &amp; apos ; s excellent report , I commend to you my own amendments from the Development Committee in support of the UN &amp; apos ; s work in relation to indigenous people , Amendment No 13 ; the UN High Commission for Refugees , Amendment No 23 ; and our call to revive the UN Centre for Trans@@ national Cor@@ por@@ ations , Amendment No 24 .
In particular , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Lechner , on his constructive report .
. - Mr President , the Commission shares Parliament &amp; apos ; s concerns on the political situation in Côte d &amp; apos ; Ivoire .
I strongly urge the House to support the ECON Committee &amp; apos ; s compromise because these amendments are essential to remedy or , at any rate , reduce some very serious problems caused by the Commission &amp; apos ; s original text .
I look forward to working closely with Bulgar@@ ian MEPs next year , following elections in the spring , and I also want to thank Parliament for the privilege of being its rapporteur these past six years .
Therefore there is success concerning the decisions that have been taken .
By facilitating them in har@@ ming themselves or assisting them to avoid putting themselves in danger ?
K@@ FOR is doing its best in extremely difficult circumstances and it deserves , for example , all our support in trying to ensure that there is no repetition of the sort of atrocity against both sides that has unfortunately dis@@ figured life in Kosovo in the past .
This will also require financial efforts , which we are ready to consider .
We are concerned by the proposals for constitu@@ tionalisation of the Union , by the proposals to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty , by the progressive diminishing of the distinction between the first and second pillars , by the proposal that the Council should adopt broad guidelines of economic , employment and social convergence policies by qualified majority .
I have to say that it is very much considered now at global level that the appropriate way of looking at things is that through price stability and credible price stability over time you are paving the way for sustainable growth and job creation .
I would like to remind the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office that the United Kingdom has implemented all the directives that he mentions .
As a former member of the Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , I obviously have no problem with the development of human rights , but I have a problem with this proposal .
We can only call for European citizens to have more rights if all their rights are upheld irrespective of origin and without discrimination .
There are other groups involved in paramil@@ itary activities , be@@ atin@@ gs and shoo@@ tings .
We ask the Commission and the Council to act together .
Now is our chance to prove that we are serious .
Mr President , I too am sorry that the vote will not now be taking place .
With 27 Member States the EU &amp; apos ; s rules on this issue need to be updated .
Mr President , we cannot be silent before the killings in Tibet and the Chinese attempts to hide their extent .
So there is no clarity on this issue but , once again , the problem for the European Parliament , for the EU in general , is that there is no consistency across Member States , and yet our citizens are accessing services outside their own country , and they want to do that .
. Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of my colleague , Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner Waldner , who is unable to be here this afternoon .
So be it , the Commission can accept that .
As the report clearly outlines , Central Asia requires active EU energy cooperation in a bid to find mutually beneficial solutions to the current state of play in the energy market .
We have crucial decisions to make in the Union and in the regulation of information technology over the next five years .
Croatia &amp; apos ; s future membership is a logical next step , following the accession of Slovenia in 2004 , to increase EU involvement in the region and encourage neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as all the other Western Balkan countries to continue with the consolidation of democracy .
The time is coming for the elected Members of this House to exert more pressure on both the Council and the Commission to attach greater urgency to this essential task .
However , if we can reach some level of agreement , if we can show that we can achieve compromise in the interests of continuing progress in these areas , that will go down very well .
It must certainly be a source of great encouragement to you .
This has to be taken into account .
In introducing a general clause on fair trading , the detail of the directive will be vital if it is to work for the benefit of consumers and not to be perceived by businesses as more red tape and bureaucracy .
In particular , the Commission is encouraging participation by women in the various stages of implementation of the European Fisheries Fund , including the design , monitoring and evaluation of the Member States &amp; apos ; operational programmes for the next programming period .
That surely is the key point .
That is why this directive is so important : bigger , bolder , clearer health warnings , a ban on misleading descri@@ ptions such as &amp; apos ; light &amp; apos ; , &amp; apos ; ultra &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; mild &amp; apos ; , a maximum tar content for products used in the EU as well as for exports , and , for the first time , a disclosure of ingredients .
Second , the joint programming of aid : the EU now has at its disposal a joint framework adopted last spring .
Work is continuing in the Council on this issue , and I will do all I can to convince the Member States of the importance of this target , knowing that this House shares our determination .
I also think that the Commission really ought to look back at the evaluation of that third @-@ sector sector initiative .
What has happened today has strengthened European democracy as well as the European Union as a whole .
Indeed , some steps have been taken to launch a debate in the country over the usefulness of the death penalty as a deterrent to he@@ in@@ ous crimes .
When we have international conflicts or problems , we need international governance .
I note also your comments on achieving , by next March , an end to the Agenda 2000 negotiations .
. The European Commission supports the strengthening of core labour standards and social governance in the context of globalisation .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman .
Finally , I urge you to take up the issue of debt cancellation for developing countries .
My contribution to the air of unanimity will be to agree with everything that has been said so far .
The European message of support for further integration as one of the responses to the present crisis is confirmed by our strong commitment to intensify and accelerate negotiations for an Association Agreement between the European Union and Mercosur .
It is because of a sense of urgency .
All that information is extremely important .
The fact is that if the laws on drugs which apply in most countries across the European Union were applied consistently , then tobacco manufacturers would all be locked up behind b@@ ars and condemned as murderers for deliberately making their products ad@@ dic@@ tive .
There is a strategy for this part of Central Asia , it will be reviewed , but I am looking at it in the context of the External Action Service and what we should be doing within this region to pull together the different elements of Commission and Council support .
We must learn from this experience and ensure that we do not repeat the same mistake .
Parliament is asked to take into account the need for this consistency and we are in favour of ensuring better coherence .
This would extend the benefits from such access to include poorer developing countries , as well as countries that already have good intelligence about what is going on in the European Union .
My third point is a very important point of principle .
I am aware that businesses , the Member States concerned and the European Parliament have great concerns in this regard .
I would like to say one other thing .
Mr President , on a point of order . I am sure I speak on behalf of all my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , some of whom are still here .
Many people who saw the convergence criteria within the Maastricht Treaty supported it because they believed it would be impossible for the countries of the European Union to achieve this level of convergence .
I especially dislike the fact that the EU is ho@@ over@@ ing up fishing rights on the cheap for rich and mainly Spanish fishing fleets to abuse , and thus I voted against this particular report .
( For the results and other details on the vote : see the minutes )
I think that it is very good to bear these figures in mind so that we can keep this discussion and the size of the problem in proportion .
We must continue at all levels to promote greater public awareness of the need to protect and enhance the environment .
To conclude , this situation needs to be urgently tackled .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , this is a very timely report .
We look forward to the implementation of the Arab Peace Initiative .
This situation leads to human suffering and social tension .
First of all , what we are doing now in the task force and indeed in the Commission - a communication on 12 May already mentioned this - is examining the possibility of reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact , including by broadening the arsenal of incentives for compliance , as I prefer to call it .
There is indeed a European crisis in research funding .
But even I have to admit that , over the process of this last time period for the CAP , there have been some minor improvements .
However , the role of parliaments should not be forgotten .
Hungary has already contributed significantly to its preparation , including producing policy papers and hosting a conference in Bu@@ d@@ ap@@ est which I had the pleasure of attending .
I believe that this is the case here .
Last but not least , I want to express my gratitude to the Presidency for its commitment and very positive input , regarding not only the first historical summit , but also the development of cooperation between the EU and Brazil and between the EU and Mercosur as a broader area .
In my time as a Commissioner , I have been very conscious of talking with Member States about the issues that they are most concerned with and have tried to react when I could see an issue of importance .
I fully support the notion that national authorities and port authorities play a vital role in identifying risks involved in this area and am on the whole satisfied with the measures adopted by this House today .
The ethical , legal and social aspects of research issues are increasingly important , if not as important as actual research .
I did wonder some months ago whether to table amendments , which would suggest a less ambitious outcome , but which would perhaps be more acceptable to Member States .
So we are av@@ ailing ourselves of that opportunity to make our submission .
I should like to thank Parliament for the support we have obtained over recent years , for the good cooperation that I have always enjoyed from you , the representatives of the citizens of the European Union .
We owe it to our tax @-@ payers payers , the European public .
The importance of this can hardly be exaggerated .
In this respect , therefore , it would be more beneficial to support the postponement motion - within a specific timeframe , since this could offer greater possibility for a broader consensus to be reached .
I must thank the Parliament for its continued strong support .
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments .
Thus , to facilitate the adoption of the directive , the Commission intends to adopt a modified proposal before the start of the Polish Presidency .
At the same time , there is increasing complementarity between the two .
Now in Britain we are told such a constitution is essential .
I look forward to working with you in the vote tomorrow .
Is it a priority of the Commission ?
Mr President , you just responded to Mr Wijsenbeek and stated that he was chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities .
Therefore , on the one hand , one could argue : why not wait for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force and handle a modified proposal already under the ordinary legislative procedure ?
We endorse many of the proposals in the Sz@@ e@@ j@@ na report on developments in and prospects for company law , in particular , the need to apply better regulation principles , the necessity to take account of the needs of SMEs and the importance of developing best practice which respects the different traditions and systems of Member States .
Muslims around the world have unreservedly condemned these terrorist attacks .
So long as our refin@@ ements do not put us at a competitive disadvantage , so long as they reflect the EU &amp; apos ; s economic interests , why should we not pursue further reform ?
So we should call on Russia once again to reverse its decision and to maintain that Russia cannot be regarded as an impartial moder@@ ator in the peace process .
And to prevent the European Union frac@@ turing again as it did over Iraq , we need to start debating and planning now our approach to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
Yet , there are good ideas .
All Member States , Switzerland , Bulgaria , Romania and Turkey participate in that mechanism .
Tonight we are pleased to be able to offer our full support to the rapporteur , Mr Sten@@ mar@@ ck , who has , as ever , worked on this proposal for a directive with great skill and has steered the proposal through the committee with great speed .
The fact is that the Union requires a larger budget and a budgetary policy cra@@ fted to promote economic recovery .
Well , Annex II , which is quoted by the Presidency , applies to questions by MEPs regulated by Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure , and the oral question with debate is regulated by Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure .
I hope that the threat of those safeguards will be sufficient to ensure that they are not used .
The Council of Ministers has accepted this recommendation and invited the Commission to prepare a negotiating mandate .
The report makes very welcome proposals here .
Secondly , we now need to follow the Commission action plan and apply the principles of a single market as far as possible .
Under Commissioner Flynn &amp; apos ; s initiatives , the Commission has looked into the problem of the future of social security and , I am glad to say that , at the further and recent instigation of both the German presidency and the European Parliament , we will come forward very soon with a communication on pension funds , drawing the conclusions from the Green Paper exercise .
I proposed a solution in both cases .
I welcome the broad support for this urgency but , on behalf of my group , I would like to indicate that we strongly oppose the two amendments tabled by the Green Group .
The strategy paper , which has been under consideration in the Council , has enabled a serious analysis of the many aspects of migration and asylum to be undertaken so that constructive solutions can be found .
We hope that you will confirm what you said earlier , that we need a strong European Commission .
The communication on human resources for health has been debated and strong conclusions are due to be adopted by the Council .
I support the rapporteur and therefore voted &amp; apos ; in favour &amp; apos ; .
Certainly the British people , and the people of many other countries , do not wish to sub@@ sume their nation@@ hood into some state called Europe .
I will vote in favour of this report as it is going a long way in the right direction , if not quite reaching my final destination .
Secondly , NGOs feel that they are being unfairly denied access to core funding .
The point of this exception is that a public body may , in carrying out its public duties , come into possession of information about the private and family life of individuals .
The need for action in this area thro@@ ws into sharp relief the weaknesses and the contradictions of the European Union post @-@ Amsterdam Amsterdam . These were not dealt with properly at Nice .
I would therefore also like to express my appreciation to everyone whose work contributed to the establishment of a single position here in Parliament and , in particular , to Mrs Franç@@ oise Grossetête , with whom I have been sitting almost side by side in this House for a year , and to all co @-@ rapporteurs rapporteurs , without whose cooperation this legislative process could not have succeeded .
All of this , perhaps , on a decreasing budget .
National agencies operate in Member States in concrete national languages .
The e @-@ Europe Europe initiative , launched with much fanfare at Lisbon , highlighted how it would increase the competitiveness of European industry ; increase employment opportunities ; and acknowledge that a knowledge society is indis@@ pu@@ tably a fundamental prerequisite for future economic prosperity .
We need to start work on the longer term position of agriculture , vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis the present CAP reform end in 1999 and also the next WTO round .
They have to stop any use of threats , abuse , violence , terrorism and killing .
The Commission response to this , however , has been st@@ ony @-@ faced faced and ideological .
Their application on the ground often appears to be unclear and disproportionate .
As you know , Mr President , this is against the rules .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , we take note of the vote here today .
We must make sure that we get the reforms right .
I would say that in the European Commission we are , by definition , in favour of a European dimension in regulation and in supervision .
What relationship will you be able to have with Member States in order to ensure coordination of their independent activities ?
Although the inclusion of such a provision in Community legislation for the very first time represents a major step forward , the Commission and Member States still have to gain experience with its implementation .
The Commission knows that this is a difficult subject as Member States are rightly concerned about the need to protect their tax revenues , but at the same time it is clear that it cannot accept that obstacles to the internal market continue to hamper companies from making investments and creating growth and employment in line with the objectives which it has set itself as part of the Lisbon Strategy .
The Irish presidency will contribute to the process of setting up a meaningful evaluation of the Agenda , in cooperation with our partners , including the incoming presidency .
We cannot achieve that in the short term without financial support at EU level .
I understood that we were to have a response from the Commissioner to the previous debate and that we would not just move on to the next debate .
We must be realistic about the state of play of European Structural Fund recei@@ p@@ ts for Ireland after the conclusion of the next Community Support Framework .
The bilateral discussions and the exchange at the European Council last week have pointed to a broad consensus on the purpose , scope and flavour of the Declaration .
As a consequence of these developments and of the commitment of successive governments to the path of closer ties with the European Union , relations between the European Union and Ukraine have acquired considerable momentum .
Also , very importantly , there is the declaration by the Council and the Parliament on the issue of stateless citizens which states that &amp; apos ; the European Parliament and the Council request the Commission to bring forward proposals , in the framework of the revision of Regulation ( EC ) No 539 / 2001 , in order to exempt holders of ali@@ ens &amp; quot ; and non @-@ citizens citizens &amp; quot ; passports residing in a Member State from the visa obligation &amp; quot ; .
I am of course referring to Turkey , which , despite much pressure put upon it by the EU , continues not to implement or ratify the Ankara Protocol with respect to Cyprus , thus effectively imposing an embargo on all shipping and air transport with Cyprus .
There have been a number in recent years .
We could probably reduce the chemical use on these crops by even more than 50 % , but , of course , we have closed our minds and our ears to the whole debate and , again , we are going to reduce the competitivity of European agriculture .
Mr President , this is obviously an important debate and I share the concern of Members who are anxious to support research to enable the genuine and continual advance of medicine and the improvement of the quality of life for the individual and society , while at the same time , safeguarding the dignity of each individual from abuse , resulting from breaches of the ethical standards necessary for the implementation of these safeguards .
We need a strong , competitive European defence industry .
They have been recognised by Article 6 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I do not expect an answer from those parties like Sinn Féin who have consistently opposed Europe and the steps we have taken , but I really believe that it is time that they stood up and said what exactly they think and where they stand on the whole issue of Europe and our economic future .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , one point I wanted to make was very similar to what Mr Fava has just said about the absence of any major emphasis on the need for an EU policy on legal migration .
This question has arisen during debates on this directive , although it was not in the Commission &amp; quot ; s original proposal .
Mr President , on a point of order , following Mr Co@@ ates &amp; apos ; point , I think I can help the House .
We need to find better ways , but this needs to be properly handled .
We must also respect the fact that it is for the High Representative and Vice @-@ President President of the Commission to make a proposal in agreement with the Commission .
The European Union is very concerned about the threat posed by the spread of HIV / AIDS in India .
Therefore , whilst I recognise that I looked at the British consequences , I am extremely concerned about the effects on those jobs across Europe .
Could you please clarify , Commissioner , what the situation is at the moment as far as the other Member States are concerned ?
In Ireland we are holding a referendum on the Treaty which will , if passed , give an enhanced role and power to national parliaments in EU law @-@ making making .
We all share the goal of a more open , transparent China , adhering to international standards on human rights and working together to address global challenges .
It built on prior ideas by our Czech , Polish and Swedish friends , and it built on many of the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s suggestions , including deep free trade agreements , more mobility of people and greater funding .
So I cannot support the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s amendment which would allow healthcare professionals to distribute additional , un@@ approved material from the pharmaceutical companies directly to patients .
UN inspectors in Iraq are due to report back to the United Nations Security Council at the end of the month with their findings as to whether or not Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
( comments off @-@ microp@@ hone microp@@ hone from Mr Toubon )
Mr President , can I first of all , on behalf of the Party of European Socialists , welcome the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s initiative .
I come from a different political culture and do not use phrases of this kind about a fellow parliamentarian .
Thank you Commissioner for your response , and a happy New Year to you in the eleven working languages of the European Union .
Secondly , I want to urge the Turkish government to take an initiative towards a political settlement with the Kurds .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I should like to welcome my former colleague and good friend , Cecilia Malmström .
We share the same view : that we need to make the transition from traditional to sustainable fossil fuels .
For some time , with the support of the European Parliament , we have been endeavouring to improve the governance arrangements of the IAS@@ CF tru@@ ste@@ es , noting that they are an independent organisation .
So there are some measures that we can take at European level , Community level , to complement the action of our Member States regarding the problem of youth unemployment .
This statement stressed , apart , of course , from the natural sympathy that we wanted to express , that this had to be tackled by the United States of America and the European Union and many other countries in partnership .
Women &amp; apos ; s organisations play an essential role in the fight against violence .
This is because we need to have it in the regular political discussions at all levels : EU issues have to be integrated better .
At its February meeting , the Council endorsed the implementation of the SIS II analysis and repair plan , which will allow for the identification of all issues and their immediate solution , as well as the evaluation of the technical architecture so as to ensure a stable and f@@ law@@ less SIS II system .
I am not satisfied - and this was confirmed to me by the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s remarks - that EU Governments are serious about this issue .
Unfortunately , I do not agree fully with what he has written in his report .
Taking into consideration the agency &amp; apos ; s high value , Parliament should ask the Commission to change the agency &amp; apos ; s mandate , which is scheduled to finish in 2008 , and transform the agency into one responsible for implementing certain EU external actions , in particular in post @-@ crisis crisis areas .
I believe that a country seeking to join the European Union must clearly comply with all aspects of the Copenhagen criteria .
We need future presidencies - both of the EU and of the G8 - to carry on this work , keeping climate change high on their agendas and tackling the major threats it poses to our economies , our society and our environment .
We can accept 38 of the 60 amendments - 28 in full and a further 10 in part .
While the inclusion of binding human rights clauses in the EU &amp; apos ; s international agreements is an admirable practice , poor monitoring and implementation seems to render them virtually useless , and this has to be seriously addressed in all future agreements .
It is therefore very worrying that the bee@@ keeping sector continues to report that the mortality rates are aston@@ ish@@ ingly high .
So the accession countries have to be warned about the possibility of sanctions being imposed on them if they continue to violate human rights .
The briefing and exchanging of views will set a very good precedent for the Irish presidency . We look forward to this continuing throughout the presidency .
I agree that we need to review what the EU does , what tools we have available to us , whether we have enough , whether we need to think again about what we are able to do .
The Commission must be subject to censure , not only for what it does but equally for what it does not do .
It also encourages the Member States to correct delays in investing EU funds and to develop more efficient action plans to deliver the agreed results .
We have also to congratulate our colleagues on the trialogue who got the agreement within the interinstitutional agreement on the declarations - although they do not use that particular word .
Madam President , this excellent report by Ms Valenciano Martínez @-@ Orozco Orozco brings together , in a comprehensive fashion , Parliament &amp; apos ; s analysis of the potential , but also un@@ fulfilled potential , of the EU human rights dialogue .
In my view , it does not .
Strengthening supervision is , therefore , important in itself .
It is a particular pleasure to be able to make some comments on the directive which we are discussing today and to build on what a number of colleagues have said : in that this is a crucial measure in that it is the first of a series .
Therefore we have a collective responsibility to ensure this issue receives the attention it deserves from Parliament , the Commission , the Council and society as a whole .
Is there an error in some respect in the title or is the report broader than that ?
As you know , the Commission made a commitment to review all existing codecision basic legal acts , in addition to these 26 priority acts , with a view to bringing them into line with the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny .
We are also committed to a multilateral approach to trade policy .
Let me close by thanking this Parliament for your support in this area and , in particular , for this helpful and constructive report .
I was pleased to support it .
The urgent adoption of a comprehensive Small Business Act will contribute greatly to the development of the SME sectors in all Member States , thus also contributing to the reinforcement of the leading role of Europe in sustainable and technology @-@ oriented oriented industrial production .
I feel that we share a common view on most of the problems you have raised .
That is why we need to act together .
In the General Assembly , the role of the Third Committee in protecting and promoting human rights has been confirmed , and the EU took an active role at the 6@@ 3rd Session of the UN General Assembly .
The Commissioner would , in any case , have had no legal competence to stop approval and therefore I am glad that , at the end of the day , common sense has prevailed in our vote .
Throughout the whole process , we have resisted heavy pressure from manufacturers to weaken the regulation and , in particular , to reduce the ambition of the long @-@ term term CO2 reduction targets .
For over 30 years we have been waiting for this work to be done .
The second demand goes so far as to demand that the EU national parliaments make appropriate legal and constitutional provisions to allow for referenda .
. Mr President , the Commission is grateful for the general support it has received in this debate .
Of course we should not endanger the poor people in Pakistan , but we have to go about things in the right way .
One of the aspects that has been touched upon has been that of information about third countries - the countries of origin of those seeking international protection .
We have to monitor the strict implementation of this directive .
Is this another aspect of the policy of non @-@ cooperation cooperation ?
We need to ensure that those competition authorities are adequately staffed , conscious of their European responsibilities and prepared to buy in to the coordination process that is being proposed in this report , because they will have that crucial responsibility .
I understand the argument of mutual recognition , but one has to be very careful when using it .
You are now the elected President of the European Parliament .
Some claim that the amounts involved at EU level , compared to national health expenditures , are so tiny that it is argu@@ able whether we can achieve anything meaningful at EU level .
Parliament and Council have adjusted the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal on mergers , master @-@ fe@@ eder fe@@ eder @-@ structures structures , fund notification and key investor information , but the high @-@ level level ambitions set by the Commission in its original proposal was fully respected .
In our report we consider this to be a serious test case with regard to the depth of legal reform in Turkey , which touches upon trade union rights , language rights and the rights of minorities in Turkey .
Mr President , speaking as the coordinator for the Socialist Group , I want to address my remarks to three of the reports before us today .
The European Council welcomed the presentation by Mr Wim Kok of the report of the high @-@ level level group he chaired .
I think Parliament has constrained itself too tightly , and we should more properly reflect the interinstitutional agreement of 2001 in our procedures to permit committees to talk about substantive changes to parts of directives or regulations that the Commission is seeking to recast , but in a very restricted form .
With regard to Mr Teverson &amp; apos ; s report on multilateral co @-@ operation operation in the NA@@ F@@ O area , the European Community , as you know , being a contracting party , is required to incorporate into Community legislation all the recommendations made by the NA@@ F@@ O fisheries committee , which is why the two proposals for regulations in question lay down certain monitoring measures , as indeed you mentioned , including observers , which follow up the recommendations made by the fisheries committee of the NA@@ F@@ O .
I speak as rapporteur on the first of these measures on interpretation and translation for defendants on which , I am pleased to say , I reached provisional agreement with the Spanish Presidency this very morning and I hope that our respective institutions will endorse that result .
Only the establishment of an open , comprehensive and result @-@ orientated orientated dialogue with the Cuban authorities will enable us to make the best use of the variety of instruments the EU and its Member States have at their disposal to further cooperation in the fields of political relations , human rights , investment and trade , development work , scientific research , educational exchanges and culture .
This makes negotiations very challenging .
We also look to the experience that you and your constituents bring to bear on the policies formulated in Brussels .
Insofar as this presidency is concerned it is a key priority and we are putting a lot of attention and focus on it .
She has cited the United States and Japan .
As you know , this agreement is not perfect : it has positive elements but it also has elements that are not so positive .
There are clearly a range of areas where the Commission has yet to act to improve matters .
In particular , I want to draw attention to a number of points that have been highlighted by the Commission and which Mr Gasòliba has taken up in his own text .
I am glad that the shadow rapporteur from her group was very constructive .
It is also regrettable that the EU still needs to find a role .
That requires finance - as the Commissioner outlined in his statement - and it requires open markets .
I would like to underline the fact that the current text strikes a balance between the necessary protection of workers and the autonomy of the social partners , as contracting partners .
At the development level , the EU is already the main aid donor for Somalia , providing medium- to long @-@ term term support for establishing a peaceful and self @-@ sustainable sustainable society .
I strongly support the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s idea of creating a European agency to assist the various aspects of language policy .
This is a very important time for the European Parliament .
The whole regulatory package is not yet clear : for example in relation to liability and the export to non @-@ GMO GMO states .
Parliament &amp; apos ; s report , prepared in response to the Commission &amp; apos ; s report , has elaborated on that analysis and identified a number of weaknesses in the operation of the directive and it proposes a series of changes to address those weaknesses .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate both the rapporteurs , and especially Mrs Jensen , who took on responsibility for her report halfway through the year .
Apart from our financial commitment , Europe is also increasing its political role in the conflict .
Finally , as we all know , the relationship has to be strategic .
We have the instruments , but we need to carry them out .
And in spite of all this , we agreed to Israel &amp; quot ; s plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip .
in writing . - I very much resent the idea that people &amp; apos ; s freedom to work would be restricted to a 48 hour working week .
We thank you , High Representative , for your speech and we wish you well for all your dangerous jour@@ ne@@ ys .
The Commission considers that the compromise package that will be voted on shortly improves both on the Commission proposal and on the common position .
The very existence of our Union rests on the basic values of democracy , the rule of law and human rights that we share among ourselves .
My services are actively working in five areas to have proposals ready , where possible , later this year .
I do not have the papers with me so I will look carefully again .
It is not an attack on the Commission per se - let us get that straight .
On the whole , the conclusions reflect the priorities the European Union set out ahead of Seoul and the European Union should be proud of the very important contribution it is making to this process .
That we know is virtually impossible , but some Member States may wish to coordinate their referendums within a certain time period .
Dear Minister Mar@@ ton@@ yi , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , dear Chairs , rapporteurs , today we are considering legal matters : the very important signing into law of a very important piece of European legislation .
Mr President , I should like to thank you for the very valuable and constructive contribution you have made with your opinion on the rural development regulation .
I have two specific questions , Commissioner .
There is no viable alternative to a Union of nation states , intertwined with a clear recognition of an un@@ mistak@@ able historical fact : Europe &amp; apos ; s Christian roots , values and heritage .
It is a matter of urgency .
Good governance is surely an issue for all of us .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , honourable Members , I have found the debate interesting and inspiring .
However , in view of the lack of resources and in line with the general trend of cutting small budget lines , these activities will be phased out .
I pay credit to you Mr Prodi , and to your colleagues Mr Patten , Mr Barnier and others , for having succeeded in restoring this po@@ ise after the resignation of your predecessors .
I want to thank my colleagues , the officials in committee and the officials in the Commission for their assistance in drawing up this report and I want to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on the presentation of her very comprehensive report .
In particular , I am pleased that the European Parliament accepted the general approach of the proposal , which is to ensure the animal welfare legislation applicable to slaughterhouses is in line with the hygiene package which was adopted back in 2004 .
I believe that is the only acceptable way to go .
I believe that those who favour a fortress Europe policy , limiting cooperation to within the Union , are making a mistake .
We are extremely grateful to Parliament for that .
Now we must call back the United Nations with its agencies , including the civilian police , but this time both they and the international troops of Australia and Malaysia and others must stay to ensure stability , and this time the European Union must be closely involved again and certainly not cut its aid as dramatically as happened after 2002 .
There was no proposal and , therefore , there was nothing to overturn .
Madam President , I will be supporting the new Commission tomorrow at the vote in the European Parliament , but my heart is heavy .
However , the European social model is a mish@@ mas@@ h that ple@@ ases no one : a bit of free market here and a bit of welfare state there , mixed with a little green posturing .
It is , frankly , deeply disappointing that the Council has not acted with equivalent seriousness and speed , but I hope I can ask you once again , Commissioner , to do all you can to ensure that the Council does move swiftly on this .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s involvement in the reconstruction phase will naturally depend on the outcome of these discussions in the Security Council - this is self @-@ evident evident .
We are just not ready , and I would say : leave it to 2012 or beyond .
in writing . I welcome the vote today on the Services Directive and support the compromise reached .
It is for this reason that we are requesting that the Commission produce implementation guidelines to aid employers &amp; apos ; understanding of the risks and necessary preventative measures to ensure a consistent application of the directive .
The parallel negotiations which will be going on at the WTO and between the ACP and the European Union must be used as an opportunity to show that the European Union clearly understands that trade and market access and tariff levels are directly and inextricably linked to our understanding of how we meet those critical millennium development goals .
The Casini report on the interinstitutional agreement on a common transparency register between the European Parliament and the Commission represents an important step forward in regulating relations of MEPs with outside interests .
Mr President , I hope the Commissioner will take heart from the vote we had this month on bluefin tuna .
They envisage a common fisheries policy which is geared more to the short @-@ term term interests of some Member States than to fishermen .
Within the EU we have strict rules on maritime safety and the condition of the vessels , but we are also concerned about what happens in international waters both because it could easily affect the European Union and because we are concerned about the global environment .
As a result , safety procedures have been improved .
However , that should not be used as an obstacle or a block to development .
The process that the Commission is leading to develop an EU response to the human resources crisis demonstrates the strength of greater European coordination .
Of course , much remains to be done in the field of human rights and respect for the rule of law and democracy .
It has been , for a long time now , a priority of my group to revitalise the railways of the European Union .
While the detailed position of the European Union has not been finalised yet , I can explain the principles and priorities which will guide our decisions on the most sensitive issues to be discussed in Doha .
However , Article 52 of this Treaty provides that the Ministerial Council must present Parliament , and also the national parliaments of the contracting parties , with an annual report on the work of the Energy Community .
This is really significant work in terms of thinking through how we are going to move forward in a process that it is currently extremely difficult .
I am delighted that the Irish presidency has highlighted the importance of continuing to implement the Lisbon agenda , and I hope that in the next social summit meeting , as well as at the March summit , those ideals will be en@@ s@@ con@@ ced into every Member State and that they will all move forward and move away from the old ideology of increasing taxes .
I believe the basis of the EU waste policy should be the protection of the environment and not to facilitate the trade of waste .
We believe that intergovernmental action still has the upper hand , and that is at the expense of the méthode communautaire in the transatlantic relationship .
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund @-@ users users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration .
The Commission considers these amendments to be either unnecessary or not sufficiently justified .
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated .
Health services fall within the competence of Member States . There is no question about that .
We can look at what we do in the committees ; we can improve what we do on registers and on a number of points that Mr Cappato has raised and that are helpful to us .
The Commission was very supportive of a Troika statement issued by the European Union immediately after the sentence .
The proposed Fundamental Rights Agency would be the practical tool in this work .
Mr President , this debate has been slightly live@@ lier than some of us might have anticipated .
There is no conflict presented by the wording of this amendment .
We all know the target we must reach to comply with the provisions of the Kyoto Accord and reduce the excessive use of greenhouse gases , which only result in a depletion of the ozone layer .
In a lot of ways this is mirro@@ ring what the European Union did at its very early stages , when the vision of the founding fathers of the European Union came together after the horrors of the First and Second World W@@ ars .
The communication and the draft regulation provide for a degree of conditionality in this respect , but we should not be too dogmatic .
That said , we respect very much the subsidiarity principle in the European Union .
I should like to thank you for this really good and genuine debate today .
That message is important , but we are also concretely facilitating people @-@ to to @-@ people people contact , enhancing business opportunities and cultural exchanges , and giving people the opportunity to get to know each other - giving the people of Bosnia and Albania the opportunity to get to know the European Union and vice versa .
It is not the criteria which are being questioned , but the in@@ sufficiency of guarantees that they will be properly enhanced , and of corrective measures to be applied when imbalances are obvious .
A number of proposals by the Green Group have been included in the final text .
We would have welcomed a high increase in milk quota but in line with our view on the Jeggle report we have accepted the consensus opinion on a 2 % increase for the coming marketing year .
It should rather be a comprehensive framework where guidance can be found for all European Union activities in the region .
He says , among other things , that strategic environmental impact assessment should apply to agricultural and livestock development programmes .
Mr President , as the first Member so far to actually refer to the Rules can I raise a point of order under Rule 137 ( 1 ) which relates to explanations of vote .
Mr President , my comments relate to the remarks made earlier on fair trade .
Cor@@ porate social responsibility can also have beneficial effects in terms of building good relationships with consumers , suppliers and others . If we can deal with the question of taxation , we can all support this report .
I think that the EU &amp; apos ; s strengthened external role should be used to enhance dialogue with key partners and to build a stronger EU .
Clearly , these points of view diverge .
We need to talk about the quality and affordability of those services .
We will not see disabled users being able to take advantage of new technology and new services in the way we would like them to .
I find it important to emphasise that with the treaty , the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be binding , so human rights ( including gender equality ) and anti @-@ discrimination discrimination issues will have a better chance to be upheld via the law .
. Professor Landsbergis , I can only answer this question with a clear &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; : of course the European Union shows solidarity with a Member State .
Mr President , I have an oral amendment .
. I welcome Mr Mitchell &amp; apos ; s contribution , but would like to point out that the matters referred to come under the remit of my colleague , Mr Sp@@ id@@ la .
If this House does not give assent to the general regulation , there can be no agreement for the regulations that follow on from it .
This moved us towards restrictions on the fundamental rights of European citizens based on popular racist and xenophobic hysteria .
We must look at solving our own problem here .
The adoption of the regulation to make the .@@ eu top level domain a reality is now reaching its final stage .
As soon as the opinion has been received the matter will be addressed .
The programme under consideration today responds comprehensively to the shared concerns which the Commission , Parliament and the Council have expressed in the past about the shortcomings of the previous programming approach .
Furthermore , there is a great expectation that the Council will be as good as its word - as will the Commission - in supporting the voluntary initiative to make transparent all payments made by companies in the extrac@@ tive industries to all governments .
. I would not talk about injustice ; I would prefer to talk about freedom , which we have , and responsibility , which is the best part of freedom , or the other side of the same coin .
The Greens / EFA have voted in favour of the proposal .
We should be working together and coordinating .
He gave a good response but it is not clear to me what the Commission &amp; apos ; s view is concerning the main point of difference between the two sides of the House .
Let me now say a few words about some specific items mentioned in the debate .
Let us leave it to President Barroso to decide on the final date , but we are ready and this Commission is ready to do its job .
Turkey &amp; apos ; s cultural , linguistic and strategic influence in the region is one of the arguments for Turkish membership of the EU .
We need a complete overhaul of the legislation framework in this area and I hope the Commission will move quickly in that respect .
The difficulty will be with the referendum in Ireland , with the risk - as in the previous referenda - that our electorate will take out their increasing frustration with the present government by being tempted to vote against the Lisbon Treaty referendum when that is not their intention at all .
in writing . - We vote against the motion for a resolution &amp; apos ; The Commission &amp; apos ; s 2009 enlargement strategy paper concerning the Western Balkan countries , Iceland and Turkey &amp; apos ; by G@@ ab@@ ri@@ e@@ le Albertini , because we believe that neither Turkey nor the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows any progress in meeting the Copenhagen criteria , nor do they demonstrate any political behaviour which would allow them to become EU members We hope to improve their efforts in order to meet the accession criteria , a fact that will be examined in the future .
in writing . - As a woman and politician dealing with gender equality , I am disappointed with the Commission work programme for 2011 . Women are completely forgotten by and left out of this programme .
The fight against fraud and corruption should be made a condition for allocating debt relief and development aid - not my words , Mr President , but the words of President O@@ bas@@ an@@ j@@ o of Nigeria in Abu@@ ja at the opening of the 13@@ th session of the ACP @-@ EU EU Assembly .
This amount would be in addition to Member States &amp; apos ; commitments , constitu@@ ting a fund to help offset the widest possible range of economic and social consequences that the European Union fisheries management decision will inflict .
The Cam@@ dessus report also contained a number of good suggestions on increased alignment of EIB external activity with EU policies , and on how to enhance the cooperation of the EIB and the EBRD , building on Parliament &amp; apos ; s resolution on the EIB and EBRD Annual Re@@ ports for 2007 .
In the case of asylum applications at the border , the principle of non refoulement has in particular to be fully respected by Member States in accordance with Article 18 of the Agreement .
It is high time we recognised the importance of food security and the value of the work carried out by farmers across Europe .
Mr President , in joining others in welcoming this compromise which our rapporteur is recommending tonight , I just wish to make three brief points .
Re@@ conciliation was also the priority theme of the gender equality programme in 2002 .
Such guidelines are on course to be adopted by the Commission later this month .
The plans , of course , will vary from one Member State to another but it is important for us all to recognize the need for common themes among our various approaches .
I would like to begin on a positive note .
- The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and rape as a war crime .
Whether it be this issue or the environment or the application of the precautionary principle , we must have the democratic freedom to be able to insist on some minimum standards acceptable to the majority of our citizens .
We , Members of the European Parliament , once again stressed our main objective of a strong and decisive Parliament in foreign policy , particularly now having in mind the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty .
If human rights are of any importance , there can be no impunity for those who organise a reign of terror .
Mr President , I am very grateful to you and all Members for your continued strong support for concluding the IGC , as expressed by Mr Poettering , Mr Barón Crespo , Mr Watson and many others .
We also need a serious political dialogue with China .
In my view this is the right balance to strike .
I would say that there are two keys to finding a way forward .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner would confirm that to the House .
You can count on our support .
- Madam President , I recommended to my delegates from Ireland to abstain in the votes on both the von Wogau and Vatanen reports , because Ireland has retained its neutrality .
So let us try a little bit more to get the whole directive into place because that would be very valuable in the fight against discrimination , for disabled people , but also for other discriminated people all around Europe .
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions .
Last but not least , the Commission needs to follow up on the G8 leaders &amp; apos ; statement on global food security .
It would be nice if this happened , but let me remind you that it would be an error to think that it was only because of US attitudes and resistance to multilateral agreements that these were so difficult .
President of the Commission . - I can give an assurance that we will try to achieve it .
This seems to mean that the rise in the number of complaints reflects the fact that citizens know about their rights , rather than any worsening in the administrative behaviour of European institutions - at least , that is what we hope .
The experience of the painful negotiations , and the frustrating failure of Parliament , at the end of last year should likewise be remembered as a warning .
The rapporteur is right .
As the Director of Elections for Fine Gael in the recent referendum campaign , I want to make it absolutely clear that the Irish position is , and should be , that we want to be at the centre of Europe .
It is crucial that , apart from government @-@ to to @-@ government government cooperation , there be cooperation with the population , which is clearly there , and there is also the parliamentary aspect to things .
Mr President , I welcome this proposal .
We have adopted a flexible , coordinating approach rather than a rigid , centralising one .
The two major problems facing the European Union are high unemployment and severe debt burdens .
Allow me to give you some practical examples .
Our proposals meet the ambition set by all Heads of State and Government in last year &amp; apos ; s Spring European Council , who called for precise and legally binding targets .
It makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for its strong support in this area of strengthening EU disaster response capacity .
The report adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - which is the basis for the motion for a resolution before the House today - contains several findings and recommendations .
in writing . - I voted for this resolution , which underlines that the Europe 2020 actions are of crucial importance to the future prospects of all European citizens , delivering sustainable jobs , long @-@ term term economic growth , and social progress ; fears that the Europe 2020 Strategy will not be able to deliver on its promises due to its weak governance structure , and strongly urges the Council , therefore , to strengthen the Community method ; reiterates the importance of integrating the EU 2020 goals into the economic governance framework and calls for the European Semester to be part of the legislative governance package , while including national parliaments and social partners at an early stage in order to foster democratic accountability , ownership and legitimacy ; stresses that the achievement of Europe 2020 is essential and not optional .
Based on the declarations attached for the interinstitutional agreement on the new financial perspectives , the modalities of a democratic scrutiny dialogue have been fl@@ es@@ hed out in an exchange of letters with the committees concerned .
I returned only last night from a trip to Syria and Lebanon , and I will certainly also say something about that but , in particular , let me say that what we need to do is to make clear to all Israeli leaders that the EU expects sustained commitment to the peace process and to the two @-@ state state solution .
But the truth is that the European budget , anyway cos@@ ting only EUR 3.3 billion , is a simple 1 % of GDP .
On Turkey , I would like to thank your rapporteur , Ms Oomen @-@ Ruijten Ruijten , for her continued efforts towards a fair and balanced approach in her report on Turkey .
Furthermore , the Commission has succeeded in letting Kosovo benefit from the various instruments of the European Union &amp; apos ; s stabilisation and association process , even without a decision on its future status , to ensure that it does not fall behind in the region .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , it is vitally important that fishermen have work conditions that are reasonable , as safe as a high @-@ risk risk occupation like fishing can be and that offer a decent return that allows fishermen and women to support themselves and their families .
Cou@@ ple this with the economic effect on SMEs - in the UK , £ 2.@@ 6 billion ; Germany , EUR 1.@@ 7 billion - and this report is positively dangerous in today &amp; apos ; s economic climate .
A lot of the tackling of the problem of drugs is a matter for Member States individually , but there is a role for the Union .
Obviously it was not tabled within the deadline and I have yet to receive a very clear explanation .
Furthermore , its credibility must be assured .
I know you are a strong and firm Prime Minister .
It is important that we seize the opportunity to get our economies together to prevent future conflict .
I could also underline that the European law already prohibits incitement to hatred on grounds of sex , race , religion or nationality in TV broadcasts and in TV online .
We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross @-@ border border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating , innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development .
The European Union is , of course , strongly against discrimination affecting any religious groups and our dialogue with third countries is expected to reinforce the respective governments &amp; apos ; own efforts to pursue and apply human rights principles , including , for instance , through national institutions for human rights .
It seems that the one Head of State holding out against it , the vali@@ ant President V@@ á@@ cl@@ a@@ v Klaus of the Czech Republic , will be bro@@ w@@ be@@ aten into giving his consent shortly .
However , the contradiction comes that , as we seek to remove these subsidies , European policy allows fish imports of unregulated fishery and aquaculture products that undermine the sustainable and economically viable fishing industry we strive for .
Finally , let me just briefly reiterate that Parliament is provided in writing with a full list of the Commission &amp; apos ; s positions on each of the amendments
There is an important principle that taxes should remain set by Member States .
Perhaps if we had the passerelle in foreign and security policy , we would be able to promote European values further and better .
I also note the emphasis on awareness raising through initiatives such as the European Day of Languages or the European Langu@@ age Lab@@ el .
Mr President , I wish to begin by expressing the regret of Mrs Schreyer , my colleague , who cannot be here .
In light of the information provided , the Commission will assess the situation in each Member State and decide upon the appropriate steps .
The increase in size of the Union , with the welcome arrival of many small states , makes it ever harder for a party like the European Free Alliance , which has been in existence for many years , to satisfy threshold requirements of the kind that are now being set .
Madam President , as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs I have been fully committed to helping shape this new right to political initiative for the citizens of Europe with a view to really empowering the people .
Does the Commissioner acknowledge that there are questions of urgency in some of the research involved , as well as the fundamental debate on first principles and that this should not be an area in which there is unnecessary fili@@ bu@@ stering by any ethical committee or group ?
We are trying to ensure that the rights and interests of victims of crime are better respected in all EU Member States , even when the crime itself has been committed outside the victim &amp; apos ; s usual country of residence .
I am very disappointed , and I would ask you to write to the President of the Court of Auditors to express the disappointment of the House .
But what is vital is that the people across Europe have a debate about the future , a debate about political union .
What , though , is the European Union doing in the real world ?
We can be pleased that an agreement on the fuels emission standards applicable to two and three wheel vehicles has been reached .
The Commission cannot dictate to the Member States what specific taxes they can increase or reduce .
I refer particularly to the points about asylum and immigration with regard to the United Kingdom , which is not perfect on these issues , but which is faced with a real challenge .
Madam President , it is clear that our political group and particularly the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are pretty critical about the procedure .
Mr President , it is a pity that the rapporteur has sung his own pra@@ ises because otherwise I would have done so and coming from me that would have been even more exceptional .
I say that with regret because I am a keen enthusiast of monetary union and would have liked to see it go ahead on time but the positions of the German and French governments will be such that if a Euro is created on 1 January 1999 it will be a soft Euro and very quickly come under attack from the currency markets .
Mr President , I speak today not only as a representative of my political group and a member of the EU @-@ Russia Russia delegation but also as the only native Russian @-@ speaking speaking Member of this Parliament .
As a matter of fact , a recent D@@ H@@ S @-@ funded funded report raises substantial doubts over the usefulness of behav@@ ioural surveillance as a tool to identify potential terrorists .
The Community is asking that they reduce the fishing effort , their tonnage of boats and their intake .
I should like to recall that the Commission will present a report on this decision to the European Parliament by 30 June 2008 at the latest .
The EPLP has voted for the motion for a resolution on the Stockholm European Council .
Mr President , I am encouraged by the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s fresh approach to this topic .
The Paper suggests a coordinated approach , involving policy @-@ makers makers in different services at European , national and regional level , to provide a coherent response to the needs of entrepreneurs .
We do not want to undermine what is a very important sector in our economies - the financial sector - but we believe that some more measures are important to restore confidence in the financial sector .
Mr President , we also want to include a reference to &amp; apos ; development cooperation &amp; apos ; so the sentence reads : &amp; apos ; To analyse and evaluate the current implementation of Community legislation in all the areas concerned , including development cooperation &amp; apos ; .
Work has been done and a report is anticipated .
The question also arises whether such an initiative could be justified by reference to existing Treaty provisions .
The content and organisation of education is the competence of Member States .
Mr President , I want to express my welcome and thanks to all those who voted with our resolution this morning .
We should hope as well that it will be possible to deliver humanitarian aid quickly and effectively , under international auspices , where it is most needed .
It is therefore important to highlight the role that women play in farm businesses and in rural areas , taking particular account of its multifunctional nature .
However , the new Constitution contains a reference to our religious heritage and other her@@ it@@ ages , and its values are Christian values and also the values of many others .
For , come 2009 , when qualified majority voting is in place , when Parliament holds power of codecision and vetoes can no longer hold Europe hostage , the progressive majority , the centr@@ ist majority will succeed in making Europe &amp; apos ; s choices black and white , un@@ bl@@ em@@ ished by any blo@@ t@@ ch of bro@@ wn .
The mainstreaming of children &amp; apos ; s rights in European Union development policy has not been achieved .
We have every right to expect that all Permanent Members of the UN Security Council realise their responsibility in the future security and stability of Europe .
deputising for the author . - I wish to thank the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office for that comprehensive answer , and would simply ask what plans there are to ensure the synergy between the two different years - 2007 and 2008 - so that a holistic approach is adopted and that they benefit one another and interact , rather than being organised totally separately .
We are not going to step on your to@@ es .
I fully agree that the Union must plan its course for the future .
It goes right across the entire European Union .
Yes , there are similarities but our distinctive difference is something we wish to ensure that you respect and you work with &amp; apos ; .
If we do not take action , it can have an impact on demography trends which are already extremely complicated , so in the next term , in a kind of alliance or cooperation with the Hungarian Presidency , we will discuss this in the context of a demographic discussion , because demography and family policies also have to be looked at in the same context as job security and income security for young people in Europe .
Madam President , is not the real reason for this glo@@ ss@@ y bro@@ ch@@ ure and this debate today the fact that the Treaty of Nice is dead ?
We believe we need something more to ensure that passengers are better protected from delays and canc@@ ell@@ ations .
Wijkman report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 54 00@@ 54 / 2001 )
Commissioner , I hope you will take up the issues in the committee &amp; quot ; s question .
If some countries wish to persist in this , it is of course up to them .
This is also important in order to protect the rights of individuals .
I am rather sorry that the Regional Policy Committee did not incorporate that in the report themselves , but there it is .
We all know the reason for this , but it will be those countries who can afford it least that will be affected the most .
That said , some elements within the body politic , such as the Chief Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary , do appear somewhat committed to the cause of reform .
in writing . - Despite the disappointment of Copenhagen , some good progress was made , including the short @-@ term term financing we secured for developing countries .
I make two further points of principle : first , it is for those who proposed the agreement to justify why there should be a different standard of legal protection given as of right to the investor , in comparison to the responsibility he or she has in relation to human rights , labour , social or environmental standards .
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue .
As previous speakers on this issue have indicated , the individual Member States have not implemented the criteria properly .
This area is one of the missing links in the internal market , and I very much hope that Parliament and the Commission will speed up one of the important directives proposed under the Consumer Rights Directive , which aims to have a set of rules that will bring more certainty and more confidence - from the point of view of consumers and of businesses - to improve this really very poor level of cross @-@ border border trade in Europe .
While the proposal for additional credits is currently being discussed by the budgetary authority , today &amp; apos ; s debate focuses on the legislative proposal .
Let me be clear : this crucial transatlantic friendship is not a one @-@ way way street .
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter .
Thirdly and finally , there are some amendments which relate to longer @-@ term term issues such as the creation of an EU platform for cooperation and development , or the reflections on longer @-@ term term perspectives for cooperation and development financing , that are not strictly related to the implementation of the current mandate .
If we remember our core principles of the promotion of democracy , human rights , freedom from torture and above all of dialogue , then we will speak with a loud and clear voice .
Mr President , in looking to the future development of Europe , the Berlin Declaration quite rightly underlines the importance of solidarity and social cohesion in a European model combining economic success and social responsibility .
&amp; apos ; Concerning the proposal for a directive to establish a new financial services committee organisational structure , presented by the Commission on 5 November 2003 , I would like to clarify a few points which have been raised during the contacts between the Council and the European Parliament .
We agree with the honourable Members that this dialogue should be regular and substantive , and that the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of a climate of confidence .
in writing . - The directive as it stands excludes a lot of categories such as seasonal workers , intra @-@ corporate corporate trans@@ fe@@ re@@ es , refugees and posted workers , etc . I totally oppose the further segregation into categories of workers and the differential treatment granting some workers and their family members less rights than others .
The European Union has made clear that we are willing to work with Iran and , as part of a long @-@ term term agreement , to open the door to closer economic , political and social cooperation .
I think there is broad agreement on the aim and the purpose of this fund and I hope we can find a solution to the procedural issues very soon so the proposal can be adopted without delay .
I support adoption of the Buzek report , which will enable the common position compromise agreement between the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission to put in place and implement the Seventh Framework Programme , despite my disappointment that the budget allocated to research and technological development has been reduced .
One final comment : this House has now begun its work on the question of transparency and the regulation on access to documents .
We - in the applicant countries - must thoroughly prepare for membership and , together with the EU members , we should alleviate the doubts concerning enlargement .
Everybody will soon be able to move freely around Europe except police and justice officials .
The answer to this paradox is not simple .
Two days ago Mr Aznar told Mr Sharon that the Palestinian conflict could only be solved by political means under the premises of the mutual recognition of the States of Palestine and Israel .
There are , however , two points that I must strongly oppose .
Of course , it is possible , as some have suggested , for a small group of Member States to act as a driving force to give Europe a coherent , high @-@ profile profile foreign policy .
But it is big .
To a large extent , the modifications of the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals were concerned with transposing the provisions of the agreed Framework Programme into the Specific Programme texts .
rapporteur . - Mr President , this is a real report this time .
We seem to be faced with one series of proposals and counter @-@ proposals proposals after another , dealing with a transitional regime in which the Commission first proposes tariff rate quotas based on historical periods , reference periods , but then moves to a &amp; apos ; first @-@ come come , first @-@ served served &amp; apos ; calculation .
This reform will improve the competitiveness of the EU sugar sector by removing the artificial supports to production that have encouraged over@@ production and dumping of subsidised EU sugar on world markets at prices often below the cost of production .
I appeal to this Parliament to support the compromise proposed by the Industry Committee and not to support restrictive deadlines .
The European Council has asked the Commission to put forward some ideas on that , and we are preparing it .
We need proper studies that are independent and will give us the whole story and it is the responsibility of the Commission to carry that out .
Needless to say , we are re@@ tabling those amendments and we hope that the full House will do justice to them in the vote on Wednesday .
That is unacceptable and puts at risk the Millennium Development Goals , which must be achieved .
We were very clearly advised that the most effective way , certainly in the middle of the crisis , of eliminating further spread is the cul@@ ling of the animals concerned rather than the use of vaccination .
This legislation will reduce the risk to human health and the environment posed by pesticides and is aimed at halving the quantities used within a decade .
We are in full agreement with Recommendation No 6 on the cooperation with Eurojust and OLAF and with almost all of No 4 of the Recommendation regarding democratic control .
I must admit that Member States have responded very positively by including the Roma issue as a cross @-@ cutting cutting issue in many national strategic reference frameworks and also through direct references in operational programmes .
In the interest of simplification , the Commission has proposed a recasting of four existing directives merged into two new ones .
We will also come forward with further measures to help the population , but we must also be clear on one point : the key to preventing a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories lies with Israel and the Palestinian Authority , not with the international community .
Finally , on the likely impact of the election aftermath on EU @-@ Moldova Moldova relations , it has brought to the fore the unfinished nature of Moldova &amp; apos ; s internal reforms , particularly with regard to the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms .
I tried to explain that , although the needs of the Commission are paramount , I recognise that it has to make commitments , put money in the trust fund and then start spending those funds on whatever projects we have undertaken .
I would , in general , encourage the Commission to publish information of this or any other nature on the views of Europeans , to show the importance of opinion on our continent .
I do not want to go into detail on many of the issues because I will leave that to both rapporteurs , who have mentioned several items .
Unless the European Union is prepared to take clear initiatives to revit@@ alize these talks , we risk jeopar@@ di@@ zing the whole process .
The key issue is the efficiency of the executive board in Bonn , and the European Union is already providing funding , but more support is clearly necessary .
The overall fishing effort must be controlled as well as fleet size so as to correspond to the resources available .
For example , there are the huge structural funds which are used to favour SMEs throughout the Union , including my constituency of Ch@@ es@@ h@@ ire West and W@@ ir@@ ral in England .
To conclude , I would invite Members of the House to support the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal .
Mr President , can I first of all join my colleagues in offering my sincere congratulations to Hu@@ gues Martin for his excellent report on aquaculture .
A recent meeting of Baltic prime ministers and the decisions taken there are so vitally important that the Baltic countries will no longer be an energy island .
Opening up not only regionally , but also globally , should make price differentiation more difficult .
The amendments it proposes clarify and , in some cases , develop various aspects of the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal , including some useful additions on force majeure subsidies and sanctions .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I rise to ask for the postponement of the vote on the Fernandes report .
It will include important elements of mutual recognition , alongside harmonisation .
Will the Court please look early at the proposals from the Commission , which the Committee on Budgetary Control is now considering , to see if , in the Court &amp; apos ; s view , they will meet the problem .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , I am grateful for this opportunity to address the European Parliament once again and at such a crucial time .
I will keep the European Parliament informed on the preparation of the draft mandate , which I expect to get before the end of March 2007 , otherwise taking the position that travellers must be informed when their PNR data may be transferred to competent authorities of third countries .
So , Commissioner , we therefore have to make it clear to our Turkish partners that it is very difficult to speak about Turkey &amp; apos ; s European integration until problems related to Turkey &amp; apos ; s religious and ethnic minorities are solved .
We must , of course , put safety first , and also make moves towards rebuilding public confidence .
Mr President , I would merely like to ask the House to support Mr Hume &amp; apos ; s resolution .
That is an interesting and important point , which I shall follow up .
They need to implement transparency in government contracts , which are subject to gra@@ ft .
We have to understand how crucial it is that we balance this kind of support in practice .
I do appreciate very much the work that you , Mr Albertini , and the other rapporteurs have done in producing what I think are really useful and helpful reports in terms of addressing the breadth of European action .
Generally , I am very pleased to say that I can accept a large majority of the amendments proposed , at least in principle .
In the context of the application of world trade regulations , I call for greater transparency in the application of these measures .
Give us at least one week to consult and consider how we will vote .
I therefore ask the presidency to contact the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva before the urgency debates start this afternoon , because this House would be ill @-@ advised advised to start a debate on the basis of information which cannot be shown to be factually correct .
I have just one or two brief questions .
So I will try to give some indicative time @-@ frames frames with regard to the various market measures that we are envisaging .
It is not very satisfactory , and our two committees ought to work together on this annual report .
Far too often , we are prepared to support one against another group to the long @-@ term term detriment of peace in a particular region .
The European industry believes that recent imports from a number of third countries , especially from Asia , were made at very low prices .
Mr President , should I be unable to speak about the content , I would only say that the previous remark from the PPE side of the House is complete bal@@ on@@ ey .
I would also like to express my warm gratitude to the rapporteur for Serbia , Jelko Kacin , for his report on the European integration process of Serbia .
In addition , the EU has important experiences to share when it comes to overcoming conflict and building stability through shared interest and mutual understanding .
I commend them to the House and trust that they will have the support both of the Commission and , more importantly , of the Council .
The Stockholm Programme provides a new policy framework to enhance the fight against violence on women and calls for concrete action .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , with decisive and timely action towards Libya , the EU and the Human Rights Council have indeed shown that they can take action when needed .
It should be explicitly stated that the Member State is not required to enforce the conviction handed down in another Member State , but just to draw the appropriate conclusions from the earlier case in the new proceedings .
We were thinking of introducing a pilot project and putting aside a bit of money , under the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , to run this and to finance the impact assessment from EU funds .
Then the EU brought in this legislation , following very similar principles , about five years ago , and it has proved a great success .
You are aware of that , Mr Ombudsman .
Therefore , the proposal to eliminate that has no support from the Council .
Make sure that the people who do the job are equipped to do that job .
Much still needs to be done .
As far as my group is concerned , the purpose of the European process is to ensure that this kind of horror never happens again .
On &amp; apos ; Parliamentary scrutiny &amp; apos ; , it includes new rules of participation of Commissioners in election campaigns , the Commission &amp; apos ; s obligation to seek Parliament &amp; apos ; s opinion when it intends to revise the Code of Conduct , and nomin@@ ees for the post of executive directors have to come before the responsible parliamentary committees for a hearing ,
Indeed the European Union and the wider international community have an interest in preserving the economic and institutional framework of the Palestinian Authority , which we have helped to create and which we have helped to fund more generously than any one else .
It is also wrong because in fact the next piece of legislation to come from the Commission will be one on GMO seeds , after the two reports that are to go through Parliament , one of which is Mr Trakatellis &amp; apos ; s report which is currently before the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , and of which Commissioner Byrne is well aware .
I congratulate you on your election and wish you a good new year .
If this means reform - reform of the institutions , reform of the International Monetary Fund - let us do it .
When the Commission brings forward a proposal for such an early warning , then it will help to restore credibility to the Pact .
In addition to that , I wish to reply to the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s question .
The mechanisms and procedures provided for in the directive update the existing ones and should ensure its efficient implementation in the years to come .
As regards the Western Balkan states , as you are aware , the Thessaloniki European Council last year fully supported the European perspective of the Western Balkan states becoming an integral part of the European Union once they meet the conditions for accession and the so @-@ called called political and economic criteria and they can demonstrate that they are ready to assume the obligations of membership .
We should add that .
Mr Van Rompuy and the other Commissioners are , as honest federalists , exactly agreeing with the case that was made by British sceptics , which was that you cannot have monetary union without fiscal and economic union .
Any new direction by the EU should take account of Parliament &amp; apos ; s unique voice on the matter and should move to assist not just Alzheimer &amp; apos ; s sufferers but also the many carers who work to increase their quality of life .
But what happens ?
If there was binding legislation that major European companies had to adhere to , then you would not have the situation we have at present .
The appropriate financial resources must be made available to facilitate this process .
We should actually be able to vote our amendment quite within the boun@@ ds of the financial perspective and should our amendment fall , we as a Group will , of course , reserve our right to consider whether the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal is the right one .
Let us not forget that one of the biggest demographic challenges we have is an ageing population who will inevitably want health care in their own loc@@ ality .
It is un@@ ethical to use environmental concerns in order to achieve political objectives and , for that reason , I will vote against it .
On Amendment 1 we fully share Parliament &amp; quot ; s concern and appreciate the speedy procedure undertaken notwithstanding the short time @-@ frames frames given to them .
It is a decision that you will regret .
We need flexibility of application in the rules on state aid .
The Council , after having examined the Commission proposal aiming at postponing for one year ( from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000 ) the introduction of a compulsory beef labelling system and maintaining during this period the voluntary labelling scheme provided for in Regulation ( EC ) No 8@@ 20 / 97 , has adopted the following conclusions :
We will continue to keep Parliament informed about any further development .
Mr President , I am going to have to interrupt this consensus debate , because I am afraid I cannot support Mrs Hon@@ ey@@ ball &amp; quot ; s report .
This cooperation forms part of our overall strategy to strengthen relations between the European Union and Russia .
Even the six EU Member States which two years ago signed a letter of intent on cooperation have still not agreed a framework agreement to implement that letter of intent .
Certainly this will have our attention in the future also .
The last estimate was EUR 20 billion , which is quite a lot to anybody .
Iran &amp; quot ; s decisions about its relations with neighbouring countries can affect the security and prosperity of peoples well beyond the region of the Middle East .
Mr President , this relates to the situation we have with the Council .
At the same time , we are very aware that , especially with such urgent issues as the one we are discussing today , we need to work very hard to find a solution between Parliament and the Council in order to avoid unnecessary block@@ ages .
Last week Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy engaged in a lively debate in the wake of the referenda result and on that occasion Commissioner Verheugen stressed the commitment of the EU to come forward with comprehensive proposals to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community .
. I would like to highlight some important points regarding my report on the European Commission &amp; apos ; s Annual Report on the Cohesion Fund for 2001 .
The other point I want to make concerns the format in which the budget is now presented .
I totally support the report , especially in the context of human rights violations in the Latvian Republic .
We are now faced with a budget where the only flagship policy is agriculture .
We all believe intensely in the importance of social justice and social cohesion , but the greatest social injustice is unemployment : one of the greatest sources of social exclusion is unemployment .
- Before the vote on Amendment 2@@ 58
In the third report there is a list of actions proposed by the Commission but its observations are rather disappointing : to continue with monitoring , to examine industry &amp; apos ; s complaint , to remain open to eventual proposals , to pursue efforts , to continue to encourage , to continue to work closely with the industry or to examine the possibilities of measures .
Mr President , to be completely clear , it means that we have oral amendments on recitals Q and paragraph 19 of this document .
This is simply not acceptable .
The ratifications will bring the protocol into force .
Mr President , the report we have in front of Parliament today rightly states that tax competition in the EU has led , and continues to lead , to EU @-@ wide wide economic gains by way of a dynamic corporate environment .
The press conference following the talks will be an important part of the summit since it will provide an opportunity to send a positive message to the European and world public about progress in transatlantic relations and planned joint projects .
This is the major issue ; it is not a question of political differences or an ideological problem .
Finally , it is quite evident that the Council of Agriculture Ministers needs to make a special effort actively to incorporate the gender dimension in rural development issues .
We always speak about a competitive , knowledge @-@ based based Europe , but some people put so little trust in Europe &amp; quot ; s potential that they prefer to strengthen a non @-@ EU EU body - the European Patent Office - to the detriment of European Union interests .
We hope that the Lisbon European Council will endorse concrete , focused policy actions providing a strong signal that European leaders are determined to transform Europe into a dynamic and competitive economy .
Although the Commission will deploy the money as fast as is necessary , Parliament retains control as one half of the budgetary authority .
The agreement will provide us with new possibilities for cooperation on the basis of the guidelines laid down for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 2006 , whether on strengthening the rule of law , judicial reform , tackling poverty or investing in human resources .
The EAS is a direct product of the Treaty of Lisbon , a treaty I do not approve of and one which has no democratic legitimacy .
We are also addressing the concerns of some stakeholders by means of an efficient and effective safeguard regulation .
It is also curious because the European Union has some claims to be a democratic body .
It wants the debate to focus on the problems at stake so that we can also concentrate our efforts on providing concrete solutions .
I believe Member States must address themselves to the fact that there must be better coherence but we need the flexibility to ensure that we are getting the right areas for state aid and Objective 2 .
A final deal would not have been possible without the assistance and commitment of Parliament .
The Commission &amp; quot ; s 2005 comprehensive monitoring report on Romania , to which the honourable Member refers , is still being examined by the Council .
This is what be@@ dev@@ illed the relationship between our Parliament and the previous Commission : the fact that we , under the Treaties , have access and the right of access to all information in principle .
I recognise the need for a strong Turkish army , and I recognise also the key geostrategic importance of Turkey .
It has also been discussed recently in the ACP @-@ EU EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly Social and Environmental Affairs Committee .
The vote will take place at midday tomorrow ( Tuesday , 15 February 2011 ) .
How right that is !
But they must also understand the need to make an effort to integrate and to live by the rules of the society they join .
in writing . - MEP S@@ ender &amp; apos ; s report proposes to improve road safety in Europe by making penalties incurred in one Member State applicable in another . The establishment of an EU Network data exchange where details of four particular offences , speeding , drink driving , breaking red lights and failing to wear se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts - actions which needlessly endanger the lives of all road users - are registered and transmitted to the Member State where that person legally resides and the appropriate penalties for these offences , be it fines or other penalties , are applied .
The neighbourhood policy is an important part of the security strategy , because we really try to export stability by working together with Ukraine , the Southern C@@ aucu@@ ses and the Mediterranean countries .
I do not see that anything we are suggesting here would actually endanger our capacity for quick action .
Mr President , like many other things in this world , if we were designing from the beginning a common agricultural policy today , I doubt very much it would take the shape or form we presently have .
I wish to be known at the vote and so therefore I wish to be recorded before the vote takes place .
I know my colleagues are thinking about how to deal with that .
It also has a track record , no doubt worsen@@ ed by its desperate self @-@ inflicted inflicted poverty , of exporting arms , including weapons of mass destruction , to any willing bu@@ yer irrespective of the danger posed to world security .
What we are considering here is the question of animal welfare and the treatment of animals and birds in these circumstances .
We must encourage them to learn about others and about the European Union , as well as developing their own values , ideas and skills .
The European Union may allow itself a few moments of satisfaction .
I would also like to remind you how much we as the European Parliament have done to make this year a year of hope and we are setting political priorities that emphasise that the clash of cultures is not the law of nature .
We feel that the EU should do more and therefore we are talking to a number of key countries to explore how we can enhance our cooperation .
Why should we , every five years , have a half @-@ year year period where the EU &amp; apos ; s work comes almost to a halt , while we first have the European elections and then an outgoing Commission that needs to be replaced by a new one that can only start work the following year in January ?
In keeping with the spirit of the resolution , I would like to suggest four things that we could do .
She is right that a majority in the Conference of Presidents voted to have the report on during the night sitting ; she is wrong to suggest that the majority of groups shared her view that it was somehow in@@ opportune for the subject to be discussed in view of certain changes in Member States .
Madam President , I should like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mrs Lambert on her tremendous work on what was a very difficult brief .
That way the much @-@ tru@@ m@@ p@@ eted tru@@ m@@ p@@ eted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform .
The Economic and Financial Committee the other day also presented its own report to Ecofin .
Parliament was right to push Member States to put more resources behind the ambitious programmes that all the governments and political leaders have signed up to .
The integrated approach is welcome , but the stringent rules in this report are of concern , and I am concerned that the implementation costs should not be so heavy that they undermine the environmental protection provisions .
The Commission will also send experts to carry out a study of business safety measures in the supply chain , and will report further on this in the first quarter of 2008 .
It will not be so much a technical report as a political one , concerning also the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty , which finds a strong supporter in Mrs Herczog .
Therefore I should like to make a proposal to the Commissioner .
Safe@@ guarding supply is paramount , but how do we reassure the public that we have security of supply ?
Mr President , I refer to the decision you have just made at the request of the rapporteur to put this off until March .
It shall ensure the application of the treaties , and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them . &amp; apos ;
We must implement the rules that are in place .
It is those young people who will assist Romania in implementing the correctly and improving the absorption capacity for the funding that the Commission is putting in .
The best way is often to show the text as it is so that people can read for themselves what are actually set out as fundamental rights for European citizens and explain what that means .
We cannot deny ourselves the means to deliver effective action .
As you know , this approach was also clearly supported by the legal services of all three institutions , the Commission , Parliament and the Council .
In this context , the Commission is preparing a proposal for the development of a rapid response capacity of the European Union , which will permit it to enhance its assistance in future humanitarian disasters and other crises .
Secondly , I commend this report for the concern it expresses for the Galileo Programme , which has been under @-@ funded funded in the 2007 draft general budget .
I am thinking of proposals relating to the Galileo project which have military implications .
We will put that help at their disposal and we are talking to them about this at the moment .
What was written into the Treaty this time was not the right to opt out but the right for Member States to pursue integration within the single institutional framework without being blocked by a veto .
They should not try to escape their duties in ensuring free movement by asking for a revision to water down the Directive .
There are few areas where our policy pretensions and our actual effort stand in star@@ ker contrast than in the area of common foreign and security policy .
This , then , is a balance between learning from the problems we had and creating better @-@ functioning functioning financial markets , but also the discussions and the decisions needed to get better competitiveness and better @-@ functioning functioning labour markets here in Europe .
I want to thank my fellow negotiators because it is a major achievement to table this resolution - I almost said revolution ! - and to have a large majority in the Chamber .
My interest is to assess the efficacy of the EU in giving development aid to any of the third world countries .
Member States are going to have to face up to that principle no matter what approach they take .
I trust that we will vote in accordance with that in the Karas report at noon today .
But we need to underline that the European Union clearly has a big stake in this process .
But that is not nearly as relevant , Mr Barroso , as convincing the European citizens in the next five years .
Much of this has been carried out with assistance from the European Union .
We want to work with you as a reliable partner for Europe now and in the future and that requires respectful dialogue .
Personally , I can understand that there are times when concessions are necessary , but not these compromises , not now in a Europe where there is an obvious need for economic reform .
Mr President , I rise on two simple points .
Mr President , the questions are very important in the context of the current debate on GMOs in Europe .
S@@ election of such centres will be based on a criterion of excellence . I support this , because this way the EIT K@@ IC@@ s will give the best kic@@ ks to European innovation .
For the first time - with the European Semester - we have the tools we need for early and strong coordination of our economic policies and structural reforms , before each Member State sets its own policies and budget for the next year .
So the Union must bring together the Lisbon agenda with its focus on competitiveness , the Cardiff agenda with its focus on social rights , and the Gothenburg agenda with its focus on the environment .
I also call on the UK Government to raise the issue with other Member States , as it is the Council &amp; apos ; s responsibility .
Madam President , thank you for your contributions , and many thanks too on behalf of the Commissioner .
Instead of engaging in this sort of interference , we should be addressing those issues where it is constructive for Member States to work together and develop some common standards .
The Commission is working with the World Bank and the local authorities to prepare a &amp; apos ; Kosovo Development Plan and Strategy &amp; quot ; for the medium term .
In addition , our own energy sources are either low or , in certain cases , less competitive .
What could it learn about fundamental rights ?
We are pleased that it took on board proposals from this House in the field of justice and home affairs on combating terrorism and indeed that it reviewed the Union &amp; apos ; s policies in other areas to ensure that we have joined @-@ up up thinking in our approach to this very serious problem .
It is important to underline that enlargement is good not only for the newly acceding Member States but - as Mr Brok reminded us - it is also good for the present Member States .
The challenge at the beginning of this millennium is to enlarge the EU in a way that creates stability , peace and prosperity for all .
The Commission stresses that it will play an active part in maintaining that balance .
You know that we are currently negotiating a free trade agreement with India , where the whole matter of sustainability also has to be addressed .
There is a crisis in the fishing industry of Europe .
At the same time , the Presidency welcomes the recent positive steps undertaken by Turkey , including the recently adopted national programme for the adoption of the acquis and the appointment of the new chief negotiator .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution on the G20 Summit in Pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh .
When Commissioner Bangemann responds , and certainly when the Central Bank responds to us , we need to ensure that they understand it is their responsibility to monitor this process and to ensure transparency .
However , I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Palacio for the work she has put into this report and for the extremely honest way she made her contribution to the report and has presented her views again this afternoon .
In this way we can encourage the market to respond to the needs of society .
We are aware that none of the Balkan countries will be able to join the European Union on its own , which makes it clear we have to develop good neighbourly relations , free trade and collective security structures first .
We entirely agree with the report &amp; quot ; s emphasis on the role that regional advisory councils can play in the promotion of environmentally friendly fishing methods and with the necessity of affor@@ ding them increased technical and financial support .
The issue is not as black and white as it is being presented .
Mr President , I can reply very briefly because my honourable friend Mr Beazley - and I use the expression in both a personal and a parliamentary sense - asked me a direct question in a speech which perhaps would have been better received in Berlin than in Paris or London .
Unfortunately , this is not yet the case and the European Union will therefore stress the need to have an honest and useful dialogue for which a review of the consultations &amp; apos ; modalities is necessary .
Would the Commission be willing to undertake to propose the creation of a European Union agency , under its control , which would coordinate the work of the relevant national agencies in our Member States in the field of communicable diseases ?
There is an urgent need to comprehensively address the multiple problems in the inshore fishing sector in the European Union .
We must agree what is good for the EU as a whole , and we do not want any tinkering with national systems .
Hence , we intend to use it in a strategic fashion focusing , in particular , on support for the various international environmental conventions .
I do not want to have a debate on this .
The Commission needs to address this .
I return to the issue of give and take in relation to one specific point - the budgetary powers of the European Parliament .
However , there are some controversial elements in the report , essentially because of the Commission timetable in issuing its report .
. Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner very much indeed for coming today .
We must also make sure that Member States invest in social security and social protection systems as well as guaranteeing access to rights , resources and universal services .
In discussing food security , we should also be careful about terminology , and distinguish food security from food sovereignty and food self @-@ sufficiency sufficiency .
Member of the Commission . Mr President , the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Members of Parliament regarding the recent shoo@@ ting by China &amp; apos ; s People &amp; apos ; s Lib@@ eration Ar@@ my of Tibetan refugees at the border between the People &amp; apos ; s Republic of China and Nepal , the subsequent death of one of them and the imprisonment of some of those refugees .
We can argue whether this is sufficient or not , but the main thing at the moment is to check this legislation and be absolutely sure that Member States are complying with it , because we know , for instance , that there are problems in some Member States between national governments putting the legislation in place and the regional governments having to implement it .
Some of the proposals will be explored in the Committee of the General Assembly , in session from now until the end of this year .
We have to very carefully weigh the pros and cons in deciding how we go about this .
Internal taxes have d@@ win@@ d@@ led as a result of the economic slowdown .
We call upon the Commission to submit a new proposal and withdraw the current one in order to have a text more in sympathy with the recently adopted energy tax directive .
Full cooperation will also be expected from Russia as much as from Georgia at the Geneva talks .
I therefore abstained in the vote .
We need to be in a position to implement the full policy agenda as set out by the Lisbon process .
For both of us - the United Nations and the European Union - the most important word is &amp; apos ; united &amp; apos ; .
. Mr President , I should like to start by commending the rapporteur on the job he has done .
Mr President , I would expect the Commission to respond to this practice because it has to do not just with air passengers &amp; apos ; rights but also with the human rights of European citizens .
Meanwhile , we will continue to follow developments in Mauritania , while fully supporting the efforts of the African Union to re @-@ establish establish constitutional rule in the country .
I know that lobbying can be useful for the Commission , as lobby groups often think up important points and provide information or even whole , ready @-@ made made , policy solutions .
The Commission intends to follow up these issues through existing instruments and in cooperation with other donors .
in writing . - Coun@@ terfe@@ it medicines are already widespread in the developing world where 20 @-@ 30 30 % of medicines on the market are fa@@ ke .
I hope that this position can now lead to conclusive negotiations in the European Parliament so that the European Union can finally benefit from this long @-@ awaited awaited regulation and , once again , we will be in a position of leadership on that matter in Seoul .
Their focus is on economic reform and flexibility , to the detriment of quality employment , better pay and conditions , greater attention to caring needs , the sustainable use of resources and creating an inclusive society .
Let me also thank the members of the Committees on Agriculture and Rural Development , International Trade , Budgetary Control and Development for their strong commitment , their helpful input and the very constructive debate .
Indeed , if anything , you want the European Union to do even more ; to be more coherent , to be more efficient .
But that is de@@ pendant on the ability of every single judge in the European Union to understand and apply ECHR provisions . We have no coherent EU programme to ensure they do .
For example , one of the paragraphs which has been weakened from the original draft emphasised the need for enhanced appropriate levels of transparency towards the public , investors and supervisory authorities , including , in the future , any new EU supervisory body .
. Madam President , I just wish to make a few points about this debate .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the politicians involved throughout this long and painful process , which has involved successive governments on both islands , and in particular to commend the courage of those Northern Ireland politicians who have taken that extra step which has got us where we are today .
That is , of course , one of the topics that will be addressed , but it is clear that at this moment , there is no decision on that yet .
Mr Barroso in particular could not have been clearer on this issue .
Until there is a single currency , with all Member States which host agencies participating , the problem of exchange rate fluctuations will be a real one .
We would have to respect such parameters and bring a maturity to our work of monitoring and controlling Commission spending and policy implementation .
. Mr President , my colleague , Mrs Lynne , asked for a new Human Rights Commission to be set up in Sri Lanka and I am very pleased to announce that the President yesterday did just that , in anticipation , I suppose , of our resolution in this Parliament .
Baroness Ashton , you said there will be duty @-@ free free and quota @-@ free free access , which is fine , but the issue is that the agreements that have been signed with Central America , and subsequently with Mercosur and the Andean Pact countries , will reduce the tariffs for them , and nothing we do is going to make it possible for banana producers in the ACP to remain competitive .
In George L@@ y@@ on &amp; apos ; s report on the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013 , which was adopted on 8 July 2010 , Parliament called for &amp; apos ; a fair distribution of CAP payments &amp; apos ; and insisted &amp; apos ; that it should be fair to farmers in both new and old Member States &amp; apos ; .
De@@ signing a reform package for European political parties as a means of mobilising the democratic energies of individual and organised citizens is not an easy task , not least due to the EU &amp; apos ; s systemic complexity .
Mr President , the future of the common agricultural policy will see increased focus on connecting it with climate change policy .
On Iraq , I welcome the forward @-@ looking looking nature of the European Council conclusions , bro@@ kered by the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , and their focus on humanitarian assistance , on rebuilding Iraq and the central role to be played in this by the United Nations .
. Mr President , could I say how grateful I am to the honourable Members from all parties for putting down motions for resolution on the tragic effects of the ear@@ thqu@@ akes in both Turkey and Greece .
The Treaties provide us with a basis for this cooperation . Article 20 states clearly , and I quote : &amp; apos ; Every citizen of the Union shall , in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of which he is a national is not represented , be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any Member State , on the same conditions as the nationals of that state .
There are these inconsistencies that we have to tackle for the good of our citizens and the good of consumers .
I would like to comment on a few things which you have not really dealt with in detail .
We have to help the fishing community who , at the moment , are in a severe economic crisis , particularly with the 30 % increase in marine fuel prices .
As I have already said , on behalf of the Commission , I appreciate the positive tone of the report and I will therefore be able to accept a number of amendments set out in the Committee on Agriculture report .
The EU @-@ ACP ACP partnership remains a model for North @-@ South South cooperation in our world and one which we celebrate properly in our vote for ratification in the European Parliament this week .
At the meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on Information later today , we must reflect on the amounts proposed in the amendments and the practical implications .
I refer , in particular , also to Amendment 16 .
So , I shall state quite simply and briefly what my own message to the Commission and Council would be : please give your encouragement and support to the creation and development of women &amp; quot ; s networks , at both domestic and pan @-@ European European levels .
Again , we are ready to make the preparations , and in the next few months the Commission will come up with a proposal .
We should be careful , because the negotiation on these amendments might delay the adoption of the decision , and we might consider not engaging in lengthy and complicated negotiations in the framework of this decision .
We have also looked at tabling amendments .
It is at times like this that the EU needs to face up to its responsibilities and act as a world leader .
It comes in only three forms : the general arrangement ; everything but arms for less @-@ developed developed countries , which remains unchanged ; and a new special arrangement to promote sustainable development and good governance .
Nevertheless , we are ready to accept the amendment by Parliament , which we believe will also be adopted by the Council next week .
How and by means of what measures does the Commission intend to deal with the current crisis which is now damaging the development of the national economies and reducing household incomes , leading the public at large to call into question the role of the euro in relation to the price of oil ?
The admirable report by Malcolm Harbour invites us to look at our research initiative and we particularly welcome and support that aspect .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank Mr Sterckx for his report which addresses an important aspect of the civil aviation industry .
For this reason , it is important to support and complete the comprehensive set of reforms to the financial architecture of the EU and , in particular , the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board , a body designed to act as a watchdog , giving an early warning of any systemic risks of instability in the financial ...
I look forward to welcoming our new colleagues from these countries to our Parliament next month so that we can begin building together the Europe our 500 million citizens deserve .
There is an amendment here by Mr Donnelly which I shall be accepting , to tighten up that provision , but it does give them some responsibility to ensure that their actions are appropriately reported .
However , I mentioned in my statement here that the Czech presidency takes this as one of its priorities , and we will do whatever we can to find a solution and compromise between the Council and Parliament .
But , anyway , he will not come now - m@@ erci@@ fully .
Mr President , 18 months ago when I had the honour to serve as chairman of the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , this House adopted a resolution on judicial cooperation between the Union and the USA .
To the EU leaders I say : make the right choice ; listen to Ireland and hear in its voice the echo of France and the Netherlands , the demand for reform , for renewal , the demand for change .
In this investigation , different Commission services maintain close coordination to ensure that there is a comprehensive analysis of the situation .
One of the specifically stated purposes of comprehensive reform is the development of strengthened administrative performance which will , amongst other things , enable the Commission to deal more effectively with changes in the current and the future Union and in the wider world .
Mr President , this really is a very sorry tale , though I want to thank you and the Commissioner for at least allowing us to have that statement before we had the debate .
I congratulate Mrs Plooij @-@ van van Gorsel , the rapporteur , and Commissioner Busquin , both of whom have realised the importance of this gap .
He has asked me to thank the rapporteur , Mr Al@@ ves , and the shadow rapporteurs of the European Parliament for the excellent work which has been achieved in the adoption of this proposal .
It is very important that Member States make their own decision nationally to legislate on the rules for co @-@ existence existence and the rules for liability .
After all , the Council is there to give a strategic lead .
We have a long way to go in this regard .
The Hampton Court summit identified six key areas , backed up by a range of specific policies , in which the joint efforts of Member States and of the Commission can bolster Europe &amp; quot ; s economic prosperity and collective security .
Mrs Rühle agrees with me on that , so again in that area there is consensus within this Parliament which , I am bound to say , all too sadly is not often shared by the Council .
We must ensure that that never happens again and we , as politicians , and particularly here in the European Union , have to take control because we are supposed to be in control and everybody else should fall into line bene@@ ath that , observe the law and ensure that proper practices are operated on a daily basis .
Our laws now must reflect this change in consumer behaviour .
I am a bit happ@@ ier with the attitude of the Council today than I was in July because , as on many occasions in situations of crisis , the European Union seems always to be the last authority to arrive on the international scene and make its voice heard .
This is a vital subject for European citizens . This has been a dead debate , where few Members have been able to ask questions , but even fewer have received answers .
It will also be important for businesses in facilitating greater cross @-@ border border trade , particularly of course , for SMEs .
We could then prepare a statement that could be read and understood by Members of this Parliament , by members of national parliaments and students of European politics .
As others have said , this is an aspir@@ ational directive about the sort of Europe we want to create .
To pick just a few of the points , security , freedom and justice for our citizens constitute a real priority for the European Union .
In practice , most vehicle producers are likely to introduce carbon @-@ dioxide dioxide @-@ based based systems . But the important point is that we are allowing the development of these new systems without being technology prescriptive and without infringing our obligations under the WTO .
In this respect , the Commission supports the joint declaration of the Council and Parliament .
So far , it has never been activated by the EU institutions . This clause would apply only if there were a complete breakdown of national juris@@ dic@@ tional orders and fundamental rights systems in a given Member State .
This demonstrates yet again Europe &amp; apos ; s commitment to create an environment for entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish across the EU .
We will be looking very closely at whether the government &amp; apos ; s pledge to respect human rights and the rule of law is met and whether there are moves towards democratisation that will result in the establishment of a democratically elected executive and legislature .
I hope that this oral amendment can be accepted and that it will maybe even allow the rapporteur to accept the amendment .
For example , it is also applicable in the emission trading system in some Member States .
We also reject Amendment No 12 which proposes making a reference to Council Directive 91 / 6@@ 89 / EEC on hazardous waste , and Amendment No 13 , which seems to suggest that there are gaps in the coverage of mining sites through the two proposals .
Fourthly , there is a need for a wider approach at EU level on the collection of health data related to cross @-@ border border health care in order to better monitor the effects of the proposed measures and enhance our ep@@ i@@ dem@@ i@@ ological surveillance .
At the moment these women - and we are mainly talking of women and girls - have no guaranteed protection .
Mr President , as I said , the Commission is awaiting the proposals of the British Government .
I am pleased to note that there is strong support for the proposal , with only a small number of amendments .
Finally , some elements should be per@@ mis@@ sive rather than mandatory to cater for different Member State practices .
Additionally , if we are to learn any lessons from the current deb@@ ac@@ le and dis@@ array in which the European Union finds itself , then the European Convention and the subsequent IGC have to consider the arguments advanced at the heart of this report .
We need to stabilise Europe as a whole but we have to look beyond Europe to even more vulnerable parts of the world and we will not build new demar@@ cation lines within the European Union .
As I mentioned earlier , the Commission is fully aware of the areas in the Commission itself in which the Court of Auditors has found a lot of mistakes in internal policies and in research and development .
This is the message which I will be putting forward to the Member States and to the country so as to take the process forward .
The Commission did this not just because it wanted to develop the best possible policy , but also because IP@@ P needs the active involvement of all stakeholders to succeed .
I totally agree with the Commission &amp; apos ; s objective .
In short , we should not try to reinvent the wheel .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in particular the rapporteur , Mr Radwan , for the considerable work that has gone into this comprehensive report .
I would like to know what the Council &amp; apos ; s response to this is .
The Commission took good note of Parliament &amp; apos ; s resolution of May 2005 .
We would be much better concentrating our efforts in the next few years on recycling , re @-@ use use and other methods of reducing the waste he@@ ap .
in writing . - I wish to support the endeavours of those in this House who have brought to our attention the crucial problems particularly facing those in the Gaza Strip and in the State of Israel and Palestinian areas .
The report highlights the progress achieved by Croatia in meeting the criteria for accession but , at the same time , recognises the efforts that are still necessary for concluding the negotiations .
But I believe the smaller regional airports of the EU should only be regulated when they are found to be operating anti @-@ competi@@ tively competi@@ tively .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , thank you very much for making it possible for me to exchange views with Parliament at an unusually early stage this year .
The honourable Member might be interested to know that we have arranged , in cooperation with the Austrian presidency , a major conference on demography and the impact that it will have on the whole social fabric of the Union .
I can assure you that , in all the contacts that we have with the Member States , this is one of the priority areas that we discuss .
The idea of compatibility between a precautionary principle and the World Trade Organisation seems to be gaining ground and that is to be welcomed .
On the other hand , the role is not merely one of being a chairman , giving the floor to one or another member of the European Council to speak during its meetings .
However , this will all be swept aside and lost if the EU embar@@ ks on the ma@@ dness of a Constitution .
Therefore , whatever the EU and the US are saying about this issue being sui gener@@ is , clearly not all the countries of the world agree .
author . - Mr President , I rise here today to ask this oral question on behalf not only of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development but also of the Animal Wel@@ fare Intergroup , because I believe that we have a very strong agriculture in the European Union .
Building this new paradigm for a Neighbourhood Policy brings with it the necessity to change the Eastern policy in the same direction .
But , at the same time , we will continue our work on analysing what impact speculation has at a particular moment and whether there is really the ability to diminish volatility and have more supervision in the energy market .
In the second place , soft @-@ law law measures should be considered , and finally , if there is no improvement otherwise , then we should turn to legal , new regulations .
Firstly , when a new Commission is appointed , we need some vision and strategy of how to handle the internal problems of the Union .
On the one hand , I recognise that the Fund is doing fantastic work , reaching those most in need .
This merely supports the comments made in Annex 1 of the Commission &amp; apos ; s own information note concerning strategic considerations .
They are asked to cooperate and , in fact , are bound to do so in preparing their cross @-@ border border solutions .
I welcome Parliament &amp; apos ; s support for the Commission &amp; apos ; s communications on the taxation of persons and passenger cars , a subject dear to the heart of Mr Vatanen , who spoke to me at length about that .
I commend this report to the House and also thank it for supporting my amendments to it .
This is the balance we will have to strike .
. The Council would like to inform the honourable Member that the implementation of the IDABC Programme falls within the remit of the Commission , which is assisted in this by the pan @-@ European European eGovernment Services Committee .
There is no other option than to work together in the face of this deep crisis .
But I do not support the use of simplified procedure in the future and I think it would be a good idea for us to have a hearing on the S@@ lot Al@@ location Directive , perhaps in the autumn or winter when we come back .
We should not make the same mistake when it comes to innovation .
in writing . - I voted in favour of motion for a resolution R@@ C7 @-@ 01@@ 36 01@@ 36 / 2010 on the Goldstone Recommendations , mainly because it insists on asking for a strong EU position on the follow @-@ up up to the Goldstone report and that implementation of its recommendations and accountability for all violations of international law should be publicly demanded , it asks all parties to conduct investigations that meet with international standards within five months , and it demands active monitoring of the implementation of the report by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice @-@ President President of the Commission and the EU Member States .
United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Re@@ li@@ gi@@ on or Be@@ lie@@ f . - Madam President , distinguished Members of the European Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , dear friends , it is a great honour and an immense pleasure to be here with you today .
We will need to provide incentives for many third countries to cooperate with us , rather than threatening them with economic sanctions , as Mr Blair and Mr Aznar proposed in Seville .
This is not an argument for business as usual . It is an argument for avoiding the trap set for us by terrorism .
She said so in order to stress the importance of the report by Mr von Wogau and there again the Commission agrees with Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath Plath .
We also now have meetings at a technical level with your services in Parliament to compare notes on the different activities in the different Member States .
We shall listen to the arguments that are being put forward in this debate and then review our position again , but our group is le@@ aning towards accepting Amendment No 14 from the PPE @-@ DE DE Group , the first half of Amendment No 15 from the Verts / ALE Group , and possibly Amendment No 16 from the Verts / ALE Group .
Madam President , in support of this resolution , it is right that this European Parliament maintains its criticism of violence and human rights abuses on all sides in the Colombian conflict .
We are obliged to do that because reform of agriculture has l@@ agg@@ ed behind the progressive changes that have swept through the rest of the international trading system , with that benign and beneficial impact on industrial tariffs .
The country has made important progress in putting in place its legal and institutional framework .
We recognise that the political context in which discussions on future financing should take place would be better served by having had a prior conversation about the future direction of Europe , which is why we have organised the informal Heads of Government meeting tomorrow .
We will compare notes on the G20 results , especially financial and banking reforms and the need to deliver a global trade deal , and look for EU @-@ US US added value there .
I am sorry , on this last occasion , to have to differ .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I understand the urgency of the Commission in addressing the economic crisis and the high levels of debt which are a threat for the stability of the euro .
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disap@@ pointments on the way .
Yes , let us have an internal inquiry in the Commission .
I would like to emphasize that the problem is that there is a considerable lack of experience .
At the same time , we must ensure that we have policies that stimulate sustainable growth in those sections of the economy which will produce the greatest number of jobs .
In this process , the European symbols are a crucial linking element for developing a positive identity at European level , complementary to and not replacing well @-@ established established national identities .
What we want from our side are those policies which will stimulate employment , which will build social cohesion and which will protect the environment - objectives we can all agree on .
We will need to see a strong continuing commitment on the part of Croatia and on the part of other governments in the region to refugee return - a point which a couple of honourable Members referred to .
Fortunately , the vast majority of this House rejected these statements and has given a strong voice to criticism of at least two Member States and to racist acts in others .
. Mr President , I should like , in a tel@@ eg@@ rap@@ hi@@ c way , to respond to and summarise what I think is the message from today &amp; quot ; s debate concerning innovation , funding , risks , ethics and the regulatory framework .
We should be clear about the internal challenges we face : one in five of Europe &amp; apos ; s youth is out of work , unemployment among women is consistently higher than among men , long @-@ term term unemployment persi@@ sts as a scourge of modern society .
I just would like to confirm again our full respect and to testify to this I would just like to let you know that it is our firm intention to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the new Hungarian Constitution .
Secondly , we hear a lot about needing this to fight terrorism .
Policies in these and other social matters are best delivered by Member States , taking account of national circumstances .
The suggestion that , rather than simply coordinating plans for economic development , the European Union should be able to establish compulsory economic policies with sanctions or corrective action against Member States who do not comply is deeply disturbing .
In other words , what we are talking about here is an amendment to cut out the offending elements of the patent , thereby rendering it lawful , and not its re@@ vocation in its entirety .
The latter option might be very difficult .
If the EU had the same road safety records as these two countries there would be 17 000 fewer road fa@@ ta@@ lities a year , a reduction of 39 % on current levels , going a great way to achieving the 50 % reduction in fa@@ ta@@ lities by 2010 .
Let me address this to the Slovenian Presidency ; I think they have been great in their presidency .
We have suffered in recent months and over the last year from the global economic crisis .
The European Union is , in every sense , a global player .
The role of national parliaments and of the European Parliament are , and must be , complementary .
Mr President , with all due respect to Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit Bendit , I should like to say to the High Representative that I have very strong objections to what has been said by the two gentlemen .
In the ten years since the clause was introduced it has stood up to rigorous examination by the European Court of Justice and has been introduced into more than 50 of the EU &amp; quot ; s agreements .
It is quite clear that we need an approach to measuring media pluralism in a broad sense ; one that will bring together legal , economic and social aspects , rather than treating them quite separately , as has often been the case up until now .
We recognise also that selling the euro to the citizens of the European Union is essential .
This sort of democratic o@@ dys@@ se@@ y is trying to establish one thing : the appetite of the peoples of the Arab countries for democracy , the rule of law , civil society and so on .
It is of the utmost importance that the new agreement should contain provision to ensure effective dialogue and cooperation with Russia , and should be based on common values , compliance with the existing international commitments , the rule of law and respect for democracy , human rights and fundamental freedoms .
Having dialogue does not necessarily imply that we always agree , or that we agree on everything .
We need very clear guarantees that we , as Members of Parliament , will be fully involved and be taken seriously in the planning of the pre @-@ conference conference before the New York meeting .
This report states that the presence of NATO is essential in order to ensure the country &amp; apos ; s future .
The EU will continue to support and work closely with the US via the Quartet .
In order for us to be successful in our efforts , we must ensure three crucial principles .
The European Union has a lot of work to do , as recent data presently points towards slow economic development within the Union .
Therefore , Ms Thomsen &amp; apos ; s report will play a crucial role in the formulation of the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal for promotion of the use of renewable energy that I intend to present to the College by the end of this year .
The European Union will continue to encourage all efforts to implement Article VI of the NPT , as well as paragraphs 3 and 4@@ c of the 1995 Declaration on &amp; apos ; Princip@@ les and Objec@@ tives for Nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Proliferation and Dis@@ arm@@ ament &amp; apos ; and the practical steps agreed in the 2000 final document .
That could meet in Strasbourg , which could confer upon Strasbourg just as much prestige as the sessions of the European Parliament .
Me@@ antime armed groups unlawfully kill , m@@ aim , ab@@ duct and torture civilians in pursuit of their political aims .
in writing . - I voted for this report , which calls on the Commission to present before 2009 a master plan for enhanced airport capacity in Europe , in order to promote and better coordinate European initiatives for building new airport capacities dedicated to international traffic and to make better use of existing capacities .
The countries benefiting most from the initiative are by no means the best perform@@ ers or the poorest countries within the group .
The competitiveness of the European defence industry is vital to the credibility of the nascent European security and defence policy .
In the treatment of Poland and other candidate countries , fundamental principles of democracy and subsidiarity and the political values of this Parliament , as indeed of the new Europe we are in the process of creating , were not respected .
Member of the Commission . It is true that this is a very important issue for us and it is clear that no unauthorised product can enter the market in the European Union .
It may well be that in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference we will have to do something more structural to deal with the problem .
Mr President , in Amendment 9@@ 51 , the German text is the correct one .
We should also not forget other sets of rights and groups that deserve attention .
In all this effort , ECHO will work closely with UN agencies , and will participate in on @-@ the the @-@ spot spot information exchanges .
We will study your recommendations very carefully , because the preparatory conference in Vienna gives us an important opportunity to better prepare for the 2010 conference and thus , hopefully , make up for a very difficult conference in 2005 .
Diff@@ er@@ ences can be seen in the income distribution between men and women : 20 percent of women , compared to 40 percent of men in Europe , receive a similar income distribution in the top @-@ range range of salaries .
It is essential that there should be a strong focus on young generations in the CAP post 2013 so to provide for the development of agriculture in an innovative and efficient way .
We are failing in not bringing enough urgency to this debate .
Commissioner , we very much welcome the statement that you have already made on data breach , but I have to say I was somewhat surprised to receive a statement from 13 Member States that seemed to me to rather re@@ interpret the agreement that they had already signed off on 26 October .
I very much regret that the Commission has not agreed to support them .
It is the clear will of the people in this Chamber to have Mr Borloo here and to hear what he has to say before the debate , so let us wait .
I know that at second reading there will be a lot of work between the Council , Parliament and the Commission to find the right balance between these two elements : industry &amp; apos ; s drive and the positive experience we have with this energy label .
Yes , we must hold ourselves to the highest standards and open these dark pages of recent EU history .
So it cannot be said , as Mr Katiforis said earlier tonight , that the Commission is constructing its own framework of rules .
The euro has brought our economies closer together , and national economic policies have become a common concern .
In that respect we would to thank Mr Papastamkos for his excellent report .
But we have to approach this in a sober and well thought @-@ out out way .
This is why we have supported a more guarded approach to the introduction of free market rules in other areas outside of freight , coupled with social protection measures , and with the public service obligation a high priority .
In conclusion , the key element is that of the inclusion of the self @-@ employed employed .
That shows that the European Union finds itself in a better position than it was before and in the immediate aftermath of the Hong Kong Conference .
It has to be approved by Parliament and the Council through an amending budget procedure .
It is very important that the Member States that have responsibility for pension schemes bear in mind the needs of citizens who use their European rights to work and retire in different countries of the Union .
These proposals should also take into account a common programme of structural reforms .
That is now the big challenge .
The December European Council to which I referred endorsed the 6 October Commission recommendation that - and once again I quote - &amp; apos ; Turkey has met the Copenhagen political criteria that accession negotiations be opened &amp; quot ; .
Madam President , I think this report is too optimistic by half .
Madam President , for my group this interinstitutional agreement is another building block in the re @-@ establishment establishment of the credibility of the European Union as regards how it hand@@ les fraud and financial mismanagement .
Based on the results of this wide debate and after a public hearing to be held on 18 October with the full involvement of Parliament , I will issue a policy plan at the beginning of 2008 .
I did not re@@ table my amendment because I knew that the Socialist and EPP groups would not vote for it .
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue .
Thank you , Mr President , for all your kind support over the years for the Budgetary Control Committee .
The world is watching to see how its new government faces up to the very important choices that it has to make in the weeks , months and years ahead .
Our citizens across Europe must see that the European Union is transparent , democratic and open .
The aim has been to ensure the financial integrity of electronic money institutions and to help to cultiv@@ ate an environment which fo@@ sters the development of this new means of payment .
I am also pleased to say that , despite this being only a consultation and not a codecision matter , unlike Mr Mitchell &amp; apos ; s report , the Council has agreed to attach the two interinstitutional agreements on budgetary discipline and democratic scrutiny .
There is a need to revise the regulation of the EGF to enable greater flexibility in the use of the resources provided , particularly with regard to the timeframe .
So to the Council I say please tell us again what the Palestinian Government has to do , and to the Commission I ask , when will you suspend the EU @-@ Israel Israel Association Agreement ?
Following the adoption by the European Commission of the proposal to establish the fundamental rights agency , the Council will place the proposal before a working party for examination .
On no occasion in the past , on no occasion I can think of , has the European Union ever backed up its criticism of the treatment of Palestinians by the Israelis with any kind of action .
I believe it is fair to say that the euro tends to promote economic stability .
President Barroso , thank you very much for a very interesting debate .
Let us hope that we can see the same happening in Zimbabwe , Iv@@ ory Co@@ ast and Togo in the forthcoming elections .
That scheme , like many more , was co@@ funded by the European Union .
This must be dealt with now .
It is on this issue alone that I voted no .
I should like to make two points .
As in the previous case , this requirement can be reviewed in two years &amp; apos ; time to assess its effectiveness .
Regardless of the proposed competences of the agency , I would like to make it quite clear that the Commission will continue to exercise its powers and fully assume its responsibilities .
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .
Of course , Member States also have their responsibility concerning Roma in terms of non @-@ discrimination discrimination , social inclusion and affirmative local measures .
Nevertheless , as my colleague , Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions , when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately , different considerations must be taken into account .
Perhaps they are in absolute terms the tru@@ est European citizens because they are only Europeans .
in writing . - It is timely indeed that Parliament addresses this matter only days after the agreement between President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel to seek to change the Lisbon Treaty in order to provide for an orderly handling of future sovereign debt crises in the eurozone .
The interventions we have heard have reinforced the importance of enlargement in my mind and underlined the benefits it brings to candidate countries and indeed the wider Member States .
It is deeply regrettable that the Commission has still not come forward with the promised initiatives highlighted again and again by the European Parliament : the collective rights of employees , social security for atypical workers , protection against individual dis@@ miss@@ al , revision of the working time directive and of the European Works Council directive .
In the mean time , cross @-@ border border laws , relief and consolidation of losses are urgently needed as an intermediate remedy to some serious problems encountered within the functioning of the internal market .
As regards engaging the regime , there is a consensus that more needs to be done , not less .
I follow Mr Titley &amp; apos ; s suggestion that we postpone all of it , because there is no point in discussing this without the presence of the Council .
We would hope that the Fisheries Council will see fit to take its views on board when it reaches its formal decision .
Earlier this week the Commission adopted a recommendation for a comprehensive agreement that we hope will bring - because we believe it is in our interests as well as Russia &amp; quot ; s - a new quality to the European Union &amp; quot ; s relations with Russia , building on the existing partnership and cooperation agreement .
This has long been a key preoccupation of this Parliament .
I hope that you will appreciate that until the communication has been adopted by the Commission I hesitate to go into detail of its content .
We want the practice to stop , not to be re@@ located .
We must respond to terrorism politically , economically and socially .
And I have also had the chance to exchange views with various national parliaments and , of course , the Member States in the context of the recent informal Health Council in Ang@@ ers .
That can only happen if it lays down its arms , drop@@ s its charter calling for the destruction of Israel and recognises the Jewish State &amp; quot ; s right to exist .
There is no way in which Europe can compete with the Third World without becoming part of it , and it is happening already .
We need to reform the way in which we take decisions in a broader European Community , but we also need to ensure that , in the context of putting in place a new European Union Treaty , vital national interests are protected .
At the same time , we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties .
I would like to highlight a few specific points .
Firstly , on a personal level , I would like to thank those Members of Parliament who addressed kind words to me .
Of course democracy comp@@ els us to take the Irish result into account , which we do .
It has been discussed in the Committee on Petitions , all sorts of promises have been made and we are due to debate it again this week , but so far we have seen precious little action .
The tax burden on middle and lower income workers has been steadily reduced , while sensible tax breaks have been given to encourage business enterprises .
The above measures aim to strengthen the Community &amp; quot ; s capacity to manage and prevent the kind of situations we have seen this year , and should be taken in parallel with the implementation of the global approach on migration adopted by the European Council last December .
Mr President , as you have probably gathered from the number of Irish contributors , this is a very vexed issue in my own country .
We , in the Commission , will contribute to support any peer pressure that Heads of State in Africa , and southern Africa in particular , may put on the Zimbabwe Government to respect the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement , such as human rights , the rule of law and democracy .
Madam President , am I right in thinking that there will be an opportunity for questioning the Commissioner under the catch @-@ the the @-@ eye eye procedure at the end of his statement ?
Commissioner , if no progress is made , I must conclude that Parliament is unable to help the European citizens who ask for its help .
So , the words are good and in a sense I echo my colleague on the other side of the Chamber in that .
That legal personality depends on the ratification of the European Constitution that the European Union intends to stuff down the thro@@ ats of the peoples of Europe whether they want it or not .
I would say to those who voted against it and to the members of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group that I hope they realise they have just voted against greater cooperation in matters of asylum in the European Union ; they have voted against sharing best practice in measures as we move towards a common asylum policy ; they have voted against looking at good ideas and sharing those ideas ...
In this regard it seems vital to have a multitude of good initiatives at global , regional , national or local levels .
. I am voting in favour of rejecting the budget , not because I am in favour of increasing it , but because I do not wish for United Kingdom funds to be spent in this way , or in any way by the European Union .
It is pretty clear that if you are a major multinational you can afford and probably have had experts working on this issue for several years .
I cannot , therefore , comment on that .
in writing . - Mr President , I very much welcome the idea of the establishment of the European Asylum Support Office , as the situation in third countries , especially in Africa and the Middle East , is continuously deteriorating .
There is a feeling in Brussels that democracy cannot be exported and that change must come from within .
The Socialist Group fully endorses , as before , Mr Pimenta &amp; apos ; s excellent report calling for a rejection of the agreement on the grounds clearly set out in his report .
This is because we are dealing with EU e@@ di@@ fi@@ ces which are ver@@ itable fac@@ tories of regulation .
But , as our President of the Commission and the Belgian President emphasised , the process is moving on and I will just address one of the issues , namely the taxation of the financial sector .
It is nonetheless important because , inevitably , the discussion on monetary union must be succeeded by an in @-@ depth depth discussion on fiscal union , which must follow .
It is quite right that we introduce what is known as this fifth jurisdiction for those who currently have their domicile or permanent residence in a European Union country .
The threat of terrorism is a threat to our security , our democracies and our way of life in the European Union .
The Council firmly believes in the valuable role that sport has to play in developing countries in promoting education , health and community cohesion .
This is important for the overall evolution , or development , of the information society .
He mentioned that the J@@ PA is where the spirit of partnership that lies at the heart of the Cotonou Agreement can be witnessed directly , as 15@@ 6 elected representatives from the European Union and from African , Caribbean and Pacific countries discuss together the core issues of their cooperation .
Mr President , first of I all I should like to say that I agree completely with the sentiments and the concerns expressed by my colleague John C@@ ush@@ na@@ han .
That I think is more in line with the tasks that we are facing in that important area and it includes appropriations to involve representatives from accession countries in Central and Eastern Europe which we think is very important .
The EU has reduced its emissions by 3 % below the 1990 level but more has to be done to reach the 8 % target agreed in the Kyoto Protocol .
Furthermore , socio @-@ economic economic indicators change over time and would , therefore , require a continual follow @-@ up up and revision process of each area concerned .
But the Heads of Mission called on the Council to adopt a whole range of recommendations as a result of that report , and I believe that we need to see urgent action from the Council to do exactly that .
However , I would like to stress that this debate should not just be about costs .
This is , of course , timed to coincide with the summit in Lisbon next week , and Parliament has had to work extremely speedily , for which I thank so many colleagues who have helped with this and , of course , the secretariat .
Secondly , we talked about the need to work in partnership with local government and local authorities including , for example , through the Direc@@ tori@@ a event .
In response to some of the points that were made during the debate , of course it is the case that our delegations and the embassies of Member States have to coordinate their activities far more successfully .
For its part , Hamas should recognise that its ability to fulfil its duties and serve the people will be linked to its willingness to renounce violence and recognise the rights of the people of Israel .
Firstly , Russia is today a very important energy partner and , as a result of getting the negotiating mandate for the new agreement , we already have a common EU position on energy , because we have a common mandate .
Mr President , I welcome the Commission &amp; quot ; s Plan D. We need debates and I know from experience in my country that the more people are informed about the European Union , the more positive they tend to be with regard to it .
Another factor is the participation of the European Union under the umbrella of other international actors .
However , Commissioner , you did not answer the basic aspects of the question .
I would like also to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the 2009 budget , Mrs Haug , for her work throughout the year on the implementation of the 2009 budget and her support for amending budget No 10 / 2009 , which is part of the &amp; apos ; package &amp; apos ; linked with the revision of the Multiannual Financial framework and the financing of the Recovery Plan .
We are about to get an aval@@ anche of new laws because of this Lisbon Treaty and there is no question in my mind that there has to be a full , free , fair referendum in the United Kingdom to decide whether we stay part of this Union or not .
There are many areas where the EU seeks competence but has no legal basis , and that has been the subject of much criticism and scrutiny over the years , but are you not concerned that , with the &amp; apos ; passerelle clause &amp; apos ; , the EU can gain new competences without the need to consult national parliaments ?
The minister referred to &amp; apos ; consensus &amp; apos ; , but not to &amp; apos ; majority &amp; apos ; .
As regards the management of the crisis , I want to highlight the excellent cooperation between the Commission and the Council presidency , in particular the cooperation of Prime Minister Juncker , and the European Parliament .
Throughout this Parliament we have been calling for the Commission to introduce more efficient financial management and administrative procedures so that it can deliver external assistance and implement its programmes such as mine action urgently , in times of crisis or when lives are at stake .
. Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , I would like to start by commending the Commissioner for his measured approach to this situation and to express in general terms support for the approach he is taking .
It is important that we have adequate and independent certification to comply with the relevant product safety criteria and clear labelling for consumers .
Of course we shall take their opinion into account before our final proposal .
These efforts have been paying off .
I believe that release of Sha@@ lit would contribute to the Middle East peace process in general .
. Mr President , the Ex@@ trac@@ tive Industries Review , commissioned by the World Bank , is an important report and its recommendations should be carefully examined by the European Investment Bank , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Commission .
There were those who said &amp; apos ; let us meet the crisis by spending more and accepting bigger deficits &amp; apos ; , and those of us who said &amp; apos ; now we need to be in control of public spending in order to secure stability for the future &amp; apos ; .
The Commission and Europe can act as the honest broker in bringing together these sides to ensure that we deliver the best possible remedies for people within the European Union .
Indeed , in many areas of disability rights Spanish law is a model that other Member States could usefully follow with regard to integration , access and equal treatment .
Far from taking a marginal role , the European Union , and therefore , the European Commission will sustain a strong engagement to ensure that the conditions of those people are significantly improved .
This is why the Council should take particular notice of the European Parliament &amp; quot ; s report on climate change , which has been exper@@ tly drafted by Anders Wijkman .
The UK presidency &amp; quot ; s contribution will be essential to the success of this process .
When it comes to transatlantic cooperation , the Commission is committed to further advancing the Transatlantic Economic Council and its work .
( Mi@@ x@@ ed reactions ) As I also said in the Conference of Presidents , it is quite inappropriate that this House should be constantly adopting ad hoc procedures for setting up committees .
Consequently , the European Union aims to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people .
The European Union has a budget it could use .
In fact , amongst the three studies on doping carried out in 2000 @-@ 2001 2001 , one looked at the possibilities for a pan @-@ European European anti @-@ doping doping campaign .
I also welcome the proposals in Mr L@@ age &amp; apos ; s report relating to the structural funds .
The Security Council members need to carry their responsibility for resolving Kosovo &amp; apos ; s status and set up a multilateral framework giving the whole region a sustainable outcome .
Commissioner Lamy , you say that plenary debates like this are to fully inform Parliament about the progress of GAT@@ S negotiations but , in the absence of the document that would tell us precisely what is being demanded of whom , this exchange is almost entirely academic .
Member States have watered down the role and the competence of the European Union &amp; apos ; s democratic and judicial institutions , notably the European Parliament and the Court of Justice , and also the decision @-@ making making procedures for a period of at least five years .
That is not an acceptable outcome .
This is the important thing , and we believe we have reached a very balanced solution .
The budget should not be used as a backward @-@ looking looking tool preserving the status quo , but as a forward @-@ looking looking instrument to shar@@ pen the institutional regulatory framework of the EU which , in turn , should aim at strengthening the single market .
Let me respond to as many of the points raised as I can .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , I am grateful to the Members of this Parliament for the opportunity to provide an update on developments in Belarus , and in particular to report on the outcome of last Monday &amp; apos ; s discussion on this issue in Council .
In a Eurobarometer poll published last week of the people po@@ lled in the 15 Member States and 10 accession countries wanted a referendum .
I agree with the proposer of the motion that this is most urgent and should be discussed here immediately .
But I agree and I am happy about the support given to this idea .
At the same time , social cohesion must remain central to our approach .
In any event , pursuant to Article 13@@ 0@@ b of the Treaty of Union regarding cohesion , the Commission intends that the appropriations in favour of these countries should reinforce the fisheries sector syn@@ erg@@ istically with development policy .
We are not trying to change the rules about competition policy for the sake of it or as a form of bureaucratic exercise .
It is therefore crucial that European citizens are better informed about the activities of Parliament and how European legislation can influence their daily lives .
In conclusion , given 40 amendments of which the Commission can accept 32 in full , in part or in principle , these amendments indicate that Parliament and the Commission are clearly pursuing a common objective to ensure that the &amp; apos ; .EU &amp; apos ; T@@ op Level Dom@@ ain will soon be a successful regis@@ try .
For example , Turkey must open its ports and airports to Cypriot ships and aero@@ planes . This is an obligation that Turkey will have to honour in accordance with the accession negotiations .
For this reason , Amendments 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and the relevant parts of Amendments 12 to 17 , 19 to 21 and 24 to 29 are acceptable - subject to re @-@ wording wording .
We also , of course , need to be sure we have patient safety in terms of doc@@ tors who are disciplined or struck off - doc@@ tors , nur@@ ses , any health professionals - and in my report , I call for this to be facilitated by the Commission .
I must assure these Members that the principle of transparency , and in particular the principle of public access to documents as enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty , in Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , is applicable to the Community institutions and bodies and in particular to the European Data Protection Supervisor .
Mr President , as the rapporteur has pointed out , one of the most obvious things about this Commission communication has been the lack of information from Member States .
Well over 12 or 13 million jobs have been created in Europe over the past number of years , which is more than has been achieved in the United States of America .
One is the question of balance between ecological commitment and the need to reduce our greenhouse gases and , at the same time , the need to address fears that exist in some parts of our industry regarding some effects on international competition .
For example , if Europe as a whole is to prosper in the global economy we have to compete effectively in that global economy .
This Chamber has a responsibility to address the issue and if self @-@ regulation regulation is not going to work , it may well be that the European Parliament and the European Union will have to look at the issue and find a legislative solution .
Politically , we have the full support of our Conference of Presidents , which decided on two different occasions - most recently earlier this month - that in all dossiers negotiators should insist on the application of the delegated acts procedure for decisions concerning objectives , the choice of priorities , expected results and financial allocations in broad terms .
Is it possible ?
Firstly , of course , by humanitarian assistance for the refugees and the international organisations that take care of them .
The Union also pledges to provide financial and technical assistance to countries , international organisations and NGOs , requesting support for these measures .
The Lahti Summit in October should deal with the ten points for improving innovation in Europe . The first two points are education and universities and an institute of technology , and then there are others .
The plan prioriti@@ ses action on the goals on which we have made the least progress , and in those regions and countries that are lagging fur@@ th@@ est behind , including those experiencing conflict and fragility .
Of course - as Chris Davies has said - it is in the interests of European car manufacturers to move fast towards the technological innovations to reduce the fuel consumption by cars because in this way they will take advantage sooner of the social shift towards cleaner cars and , by doing that , they will profit .
in writing . - I welcome this report which :
Obviously the High Representative will be very important but what is crucial is that this appointment should not be a fudge and that we appoint somebody who we know can do the job and whom the Council is prepared to allow to do the job . That High Representative must work with the other institutions , the Commission and Parliament .
Those are the amendments that the Budgetary Control Committee has submitted .
It must maintain the momentum of our work to address the economic crisis , mainly its impact on unemployment .
We have seen the conditions in which many people are kept and while the proposed directive makes clear that detention centres should not be prisons , it is not always clear to us what the difference is between those centres and prisons .
We worked very closely with the Spanish presidency in the first semester of last year to achieve this , and it was a very important step forward .
Rather than lay out a wish list of every new policy or new idea , I want to touch very briefly on some of the points you raised and try to re @-@ emphasise emphasise those within our role and work here in Parliament .
We would like to have the vote tomorrow so that Parliament can express its views in a vote in plenary .
Therefore , when recital F in this report refers to subsidiarity as a &amp; apos ; dynamic concept &amp; apos ; , I think we should add the word &amp; apos ; pragmatic &amp; apos ; , because , as recital G says it is &amp; apos ; an appropriate legal technique &amp; apos ; .
Citizens really worry about these issues .
I have proposed in my report - and it has been endorsed by the committee and I am sure will be endorsed by Parliament - that the Commission and the two banks should come before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on a regular basis to account for the coordination of the roles , and for the implementation of the policies , of both banks .
I therefore welcome the proposal for a Council regulation and the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s report , specifically regarding the concept of prevention in shaping an EU response to natural disasters .
The Comprehensive Nuclear T@@ est Ban Treaty is in the interest of all States worldwide , and the European Union is correct to restate its deep commitment to bringing the treaty into force at the earliest opportunity possible .
At a time when expectations of politicians in general are running so high , I would urge colleagues to demonstrate and prove to the citizens of Europe that we are in step with them , as we were in step with them over the weekend , and play our part in making poverty history .
As for the creation and subsequent implementation of multilateral instruments , the Commission shares the report &amp; quot ; s opinion that the European Union should play a leading role and assist third countries in fulfilling their obligations , as we have done , for example , in relation to counter @-@ terrorism terrorism .
It strengthens the institutional power of the Union .
Let us hope that the solemn proclamation of the Charter on Fundamental Rights today will stand as one side and the Agency will stand as the other side of the same coin : a first practical step towards a future Union policy on human rights and fundamental freedoms .
On higher education , if we do not make progress quickly , then higher education and universities in Europe are really the engine behind everything : the labour and financial markets and , finally , the coherence between macroeconomic policies and structural policies which have to be in place .
Our colleague , Mr Colom i Naval will have considerable support for the issue of having more flexibility and transparency .
We cannot overcome the economic , social and climate crisis we face using the same policies and mindset that created them ; we cannot build a more democratic and more effective Europe unless we do so within the real and changing political climate .
That will no longer be possible .
Our approach must be coherent .
I very much welcome the fact that all the European Union institutions are united in working towards the abolition of the death penalty and am pleased that once again the European Parliament is in the forefront of these efforts .
It is unnecessarily complicated .
All this reinforces the fact that the security of our citizens has to be an absolute priority for the EU but , as a number of colleagues have already pointed out , that needs real action .
The Commission have begun to take a tentative but welcome step in that direction and perhaps the Commissioner will say more about that when he replies .
The preparation of the report has enabled us to reflect on how to effect these improvements without compromising the directive &amp; apos ; s principles .
We simply cannot accept the continuing scandal of 80 million people at risk of poverty in the European Union .
We of course support the Italian initiative and Parliament &amp; apos ; s motion for a resolution , but we have to see - and this is at stake - the tactical nature .
We are also going to see a strengthening of national regulatory authorities .
I can understand that , but it does not change the fact that you were always opposed to the policy .
I cannot vote for this proposal tomorrow if the em@@ as@@ cul@@ ation of Article 4 takes place .
So there is an awful lot of good in it and I think that if we are thinking of having a new constitution , we can learn a lot from what Hungary has done .
Mr President , Transnistria has been an issue in the debate here today , and is an issue on the ground .
They seek to improve the implementation of Community environmental law and have the same starting point : we all recognise that there is a lack of effectiveness in the protection of the environment in our Member States .
Like other candidate countries , of course , Turkey also has to comply with the principles of democracy , freedom and human rights and to adopt its legislative system to the acquis communautaire .
It is true that the budget has been reduced this year , but this should , we hope , not be an impediment to our political ambitions in civilian ESDP , provided that there are no new significant missions this year .
I cannot conclude without indicating once again my personal satisfaction , as well as the Commission &amp; apos ; s satisfaction , with the vote that took place earlier today on the proposal for a regulation establishing the new European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights .
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are prompted by a wish to clarify the demar@@ cation line between the scope of the regulation and other matters , some of which are governed by the Schengen acquis , integrated into the Community .
We know that the negotiations will not be easy .
There has been significant progress , and most recently we received a very positive document detailing changes in the financial regulation and the staff regulations yesterday evening in the Committee on Budgets .
We are trying to have a coordinated , responsible and coherent response to everything relating to migration and borders because it all goes together .
If the Commission does not often make proposals that you have rightly put forward , it was not always because we were sleeping or because there was an ideological bias .
We may want to ensure that those criteria are applied in a non @-@ discriminatory discriminatory way , but companies that comply with all the European rules on environment and on employment criteria must be able to tender in a non @-@ discriminatory discriminatory way .
The procedure established by the two proposals will apply primarily to the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between a Member State and third countries .
Furthermore , the Council established a new open method of coordination which encourages Member States to work together to improve the impact on social inclusion of policies in fields such as social protection , employment , health , housing and education .
Can we have a guarantee - and I am sure the Commission can give us this - that it retains its absolute independence in this matter and will not be subject to bullying from any individual Member State or any other source ?
Turkey &amp; apos ; s active foreign policy is a strong potential asset for the European Union , provided it is developed within the framework of Turkey &amp; apos ; s EU accession process .
It is based on the principle of availability of all data , information and intelligence held by all agencies across the European Union .
My hesitation about broadening the scope of debt cancellation to , for instance , middle @-@ income income countries , is based on the consideration that if we do that we will take money from the least @-@ developed developed and poorest countries and give it to countries that are relatively much better off .
Tax@@ ing the profits and wages of the financial sector could ensure that it is taxed fairly , while also generating much @-@ needed needed revenues .
Clearly this is very complex subject and Mr Nielson did not appear to really know what the Commission position was .
First of all , we should underline that the Commission has been supporting Member States in preparing the transposition of the directive .
However , I have a number of problems with the idea of the EU gathering statistics at this level of detail .
I want to ask him today if he would take up the recommendations endorsed almost unanimously by this Parliament in my report last November , which showed how this could be done .
in writing . - I welcome this resolution , which maps out and summarises the most important concerns on the state of fundamental rights within the Union , and the recommendations it contains on how to improve human rights within Member States .
To establish a fairer division of responsibility we need to ensure that solidarity is truly rendered meaningful .
My second main concern is that we connect and communicate more coherently with the people of Europe .
It is vital that this directive is implemented in a sensible way , both by the Commission , by CESR - &amp; apos ; Ca@@ es@@ ar &amp; apos ; - and by the regulatory authorities in each country .
Mr President , I agree that the report as it stands is now admissible , but that is because changes were made that I and Parliament &amp; apos ; s services asked for and which the services upheld .
We need to explain what the European Union is trying to achieve with the single currency project and with enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe .
Could the Portuguese Presidency confirm that sufficient work has been done to ensure that agreement can be reached in December ?
But , to do this , we need joined @-@ up up thinking and joined @-@ up up action with other programmes - on job creation and on economic growth - in this sector .
But this is not about centralisation - quite the contrary .
. The Commission attaches great importance to the rights of freedom of religion , belief and expression in its dialogues with third countries .
I have to say that it is sheer hypocrisy to continue to protect our own agricultural competitive position with higher resources , while at the same time forcing developing countries to liberalise .
Co@@ st @-@ effectiveness effectiveness is an important principle and the compromise in front of us would be OK as proposed if the objective were to cut 20 % of global emissions .
It is regrettable but understandable that problems have increased in the areas of the structural funds , because we have reached an unprecedented level of spending and the regulations in the first place were difficult , as was drawn attention to last year .
. I voted as I did on this resolution because , along with many concerned London constituents , I believe there should be an objective investigation of allegations , both of the alleged use of EU countries by the CIA for the transportation of prisoners , and the alleged use of European soil for the illegal detention of prisoners .
That is not what the taxpayers and consumers of Europe want .
I have a criticism and I would appreciate your comments in your concluding statement .
We seem to do quite a lot of wringing our hands about the Council &amp; apos ; s reluctance to agree an energy tax and other fiscal measures .
Let us hope that the publication of next month &amp; apos ; s annual report will show significant improvement .
The common systems proposed here will make it even harder for nation states to protect their own borders and easier for untold numbers of economic migrants to cross those borders .
Our aim is to find a solution which provides real added value without creating more red tape and which respects the principle of subsidiarity .
I support Mrs Muscardini &amp; apos ; s report .
I will be voting enthusiastically in favour of this report today .
To do that , we need to give voice to the reasons for Europe in terms of how Europe is relevant to people &amp; quot ; s lives and their worries , their hopes and their ambitions .
Only through that mutual reinforcement of contact will security be guaranteed for the Palestinians and Israelis and the region as a whole .
I will , if I may , try and pick up some of the key points that were made and at least begin to give you responses to that .
Mr President , in tabling this report on regionalisation which is an own @-@ initiative initiative report from the Committee on Fisheries , let me immediately pay tribute to our former colleague All@@ an Macartney whose strong sense of European identity per@@ v@@ ades this entire document .
We have always accepted that , ultimately , in any democratic chamber the majority has the right to get its way , but what we have just heard is the most intolerant position that does not allow any opposition , that does not allow any dissen@@ ting view and , if my colleagues want to understand why the European Union is so unpopular with the voters out there , you need only consider your own intolerant attitude towards anyone expressing any view other than your own .
Mr President , there is great concern , and justifiably so , surrounding the extremely grave situation in the Middle East .
That is the mandate we are giving you here today .
But it is the pro @-@ Europeans Europeans that need to lead the case for modernisation and change .
In this regard responsibility rests primarily with the national authorities .
They do not say that they also want to prevent the European Union having any role whatsoever in standing up for the basic freedoms that support democracy across Europe .
If there is enough political will in the Council , anything is possible .
Accep@@ tance of these amendments would simply mean maintaining the status quo .
I would point out that those amendments which the Commission finds unacceptable are related to the key issues that I highlighted earlier and that are commonly debated by both Parliament and the Council .
We must address the need to boost growth throughout the Union so as to capit@@ alise on the economic recovery that is now evident .
Although I have been a constant cri@@ tic of Turkey &amp; apos ; s human rights record and its treatment of the Kurds , I also strongly support the decision of the 1999 Helsinki European Council to recognise Turkey as an candidate country .
It may also facilitate a non @-@ pol@@ em@@ ical pol@@ em@@ ical and substantial dialogue with the members of the New World W@@ ine Group .
On the question of the adoption of the procedural code under Article 298 , the Commission understands that a working group has been set up in Parliament to study the potential scope and content of such an initiative .
There is still some work to be done in the common space of freedom , security and justice .
That is certainly not the way to ensure that Europe will flourish or that Britain will get the best benefits from its membership of the European Union .
The action plan proposed by the Commission is , unfortunately , more planning and less action .
It is important to say that .
Let me also mention the costs , because many of you have referred to the costs for industry .
We have heard something of that this morning .
But Parliament is right : more progress depends on integrating a political layer to this process , so that the stakes can be properly debated .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like to thank Parliament and the rapporteurs in particular for supporting the Commission on these important agreements . All three have been strongly supported by the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
But on top of that comes a political concern . Within the Commission we had a discussion a week or so ago on the situation in some of the outermost regions in the context of migration and the difficult situations experienced .
This is a fall@@ acy .
Since we have the social dialogue , what knowledge do we have of industrial relations throughout the European Union and what particular safeguards and institutional devices do we need to acquire to ensure the progress of industrial relations throughout the European Community .
The protection of children must be a shared responsibility .
It is why Europe rightly champions UN policies : the 0.7 % target in the Millennium Goals within EU development policy , and Europe providing over half of all support to the UN High Commission for Refugees , which stands up for fundamental rights as a bul@@ wark against the racism and xenophobia now sweeping our continent .
At the dawn of the 21st century , we should send a message to the world that the EU recognises the ability in all , the right to equal treatment and equal access to opportunity .
We should maintain and sanction the leading role of Europe in this process .
In principle I agree with Mrs Thomsen &amp; apos ; s report , which seeks to identify the barriers that account for the under @-@ representation representation of women in science and I agree that most education systems in Europe continue to sustain gender stereotypes .
&amp; apos ; The major cross @-@ border border projects of the last decade , such as the Chan@@ nel T@@ un@@ nel , the high @-@ speed speed line between Brussels and Paris and the bridge / tunnel between Sweden and Denmark , send out signals to the citizens of the European Union that European integration is progressing ? .
Yes , we could go there - we should be trying to go there , but I do not think we should be starting there .
It is also exemplified by the fact that the one Commissioner we have with us this evening is the Environment Commissioner .
One area we must look at is ensuring that the pension is set at a proper , reasonable standard of living to allow people to have independence and freedom of choice .
You will appreciate from this presentation that next week &amp; apos ; s European Council has many substantial issues to address .
The facts are so@@ b@@ ering .
I think it is quite correct that we dropped the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s first proposal to cap or to restrict the number of parliamentary questions that could be asked .
Can I take it that the Commission is actively pursuing the matter at the IGC of treating this as part of the Treaty ?
The Commission also agrees with the rapporteur about cooperation with the national parliaments and with the national administrations as part of the efforts to find solutions to problems raised by petitions .
Despite the creation of the Human Rights Council , the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly remains , of course , an equally important forum for human rights issues .
For instance , one sees such statements as : &amp; quot ; ... the development of a genuine fisheries policy requires that the powers of monitoring fishing activity must be assigned to the Commission &amp; quot ; ; &amp; quot ; ... the establishment of a proper Community system of monitoring fisheries is bound to entail a degree of sovereignty being transferred to the Union institutions &amp; quot ; ; and &amp; quot ; ... the European Union is not a con@@ federation of states but a &amp; apos ; sui gener@@ is &amp; apos ; entity in international law , in which ... there is a desire for economic , social and political integration ... &amp; quot ; .
I would like to specifically draw your attention to a few things .
Those in charge on both sides should be congratulated .
Even in those new Member States where this has not yet been achieved , the joint inclusion memoranda have highlighted the need to pay more attention in this respect .
Mr President , the Commissioner has received a great deal of advice today , so I am not going to repeat anything other than the fact that we all hope that Romania and Bulgaria will meet the criteria and join the European Union .
We should act together against violence and intimidation with the help of legislation and also by setting a good example in our everyday lives .
The problem is that some of the Member States have had Socialist governments , and in all these governments , in all these countries , we have seen the deficit going up a result of the policies you advocated .
I have to ask : why is this proposal necessary ?
But of course , you would rather do that than promote a referendum on the new constitution amongst your own people .
Better labelling would have been sufficient to provide such protection as is needed , but perhaps that would not have been enough to satisfy the big drug companies , which are seeking to control a lucrative market .
It appears to be resistant to treatment by antibiotics , to have a variable development and not necessarily to follow the course one would expect in terms of the vulnerability of the patients concerned .
A number of comments also touch on the need to ensure that developing countries are able to access sufficient and good @-@ quality quality aid for trade to help them build trade capacity and harness the potential of trade to drive their own economic growth and sustainable development .
The general trend resulting from the plenary debates is in line with the European Union &amp; apos ; s common positions , including the articulation with other instruments .
I can already inform you that this mixed approach is supported by a large majority of respondents to the Green Paper .
The Commission is satisfied that this process is carried out in a transparent and independent manner in the EU .
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
We need to improve that .
For that reason , we oppose the GUE / NGL resolution .
I am convinced that , if we have the will to be bold , we can show Europe as the decisive influence in building the right future for our citizens .
Sup@@ port@@ ers of this appeal will be invited to come together to agree upon their plans to campaign for the condemnation of violent and illegal actions by individual states and to establish the sovereignty of the UN framework .
I would , therefore , urge Parliament to reconsider its position on this issue .
The British Socialist delegation ( EPLP ) voted in favour of the Cavada report and the EP &amp; apos ; s resolution on the progress made in the EU towards the area of freedom , security and justice ( AF@@ S@@ J ) ( Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty ) because we support any actions to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the EU institutions and their capacity to deliver for our citizens in the field of Justice and Home Affairs .
This is an anachron@@ ism in a Europe in which we have a labour market where people can move freely from one country to another .
F@@ ul@@ filling the commitments that we have taken would be an excellent start .
So the measures being taken must fulfil certain criteria regarding the long @-@ term term viability and competitiveness of the European industry , including investment in innovation and clean cars etc .
This House cannot extend this crisis into those coming weeks .
There are two simple points I want to make .
I voted against Parliament &amp; apos ; s discharge in the light of many of the press reports that have stem@@ med from an internal audit report drawn up by Parliament &amp; apos ; s services .
The Committee on Economic Affairs is currently working on a report on global economic governance , which I hope will lead to Commission proposals on improvements to the EU &amp; apos ; s external representation in this field .
And certainly the evidence is there for all to see .
Energy mix is up to Member States , but let us be sensible and acknowledge that the energy mix in one country will affect others , and that is why we need targets on cutting CO2 emissions by 30 % by 2020 .
I always feel a certain schizophren@@ ia when working on these matters on the Schengen projects because I am a British MEP , but it obviously would be a good thing both for the European Union and for the Western Balkan region if the UK were to follow suit as quickly as possible .
There was unease , however , because of an amendment on the Armenian genocide .
I understand that the House would welcome further information on this point .
What is perhaps less widely appreciated is the extent to which these lobbying organisations , as my colleague Mr Heaton @-@ Harris Harris has just said , are themselves cre@@ atures of the European Union , wholly dependent on the Commission for their funding .
That is another way in which Parliament can put forward its opinion forcefully and with conviction .
The question I wish to ask the Commissioner relates to the final comments that she made about the Commission not being the final arbiter in private conflicts - that was what I wrote down from what she said .
Internal politics has also been a feature of this debate .
In@@ f@@ lation has so far declined less ste@@ e@@ ply and less rapidly than we expected at the turn of the year .
I have also taken note today of the concerns that have been expressed over the absorption capacity of the Union .
More regulation is the problem , not the solution .
I support the call to the seven Member States which have not yet signed the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Ex@@ plo@@ itation and Sexual Abu@@ se .
I think we , as the European Union , have a duty to make the fight against exclusion and poverty one of our priorities .
The obligations on us , therefore , are clear and we cannot evade our responsibilities .
We need clarity as to how this can be addressed within the WTO rules , because farmers in Europe want access to the best technologies available to them to be more productive .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . Mr President , this could be the right moment to repeat the common set of good governance principles that the Commission wanted to include in an interinstitutional agreement to oversee and help the functioning of these agencies , because it would give a definition of these agencies and would create rules on their creation , structure and functioning , including issues of transparency , evaluation and control .
We try to help those in the West Bank , Palestinians , as much as we can via financial help and in every other way .
Member States are being given a great deal of flexibility , and we hope that all Member States will give this issue the importance it deserves .
Another result of the evaluation was the establishment of a dispute resolution mechanism , but it has taken far too long for the EU to transpose this into legislation .
However , the take @-@ up up of this and other schemes is patch@@ y .
Therefore , it is crucial that all Member States commit themselves to making their full contribution .
The increase in China &amp; quot ; s military spending , particularly in the light of its provo@@ cative announcements of the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan , also provides grounds for concern .
On gho@@ st fishing , we stressed the importance of monitoring the existing transitional measure , to ensure that it is not simply leading to displacement of effort , and the importance of the full involvement of the European Parliament in discussions relating to long @-@ term term controls .
I am not sure that he and I would agree on what that problem is .
However , the agreement reached between the German Chancellor and the French President about imposing political sanctions to ensure financial stability will require those changes .
I speak for some Members on this side of the House in saying that there are concerns about this report .
Madam President , I have a question for the Commissioner .
On the other hand , we need to have an intensified dialogue with , and to support , civil society and citizens - and , in practical terms , that means continuing our assistance to NGOs , the media and students , and perhaps an increased effort to enhance mobility for citizens who wish to travel to the European Union .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I think that I can join all those who have said that this is a nice piece of collaboration in order to get a nice piece of legislation .
Although the report is a step in the right direction , there is still more that needs to be done .
It is exactly what Members of the European Parliament were demanding .
A common legal base is appropriate since our relations with all these countries are based on common values and shared interests .
We will , when we are asked for an opinion , and we have to be asked for our opinion , urge the Intergovernmental Conference to make a reference somewhere in the text to this concept of the Eurosystem , which is the central bank of the European people , something which up until now has not been mentioned , either in the current Treaty or in the draft Constitution .
Thank you very much indeed for allowing us to make this point .
As policy @-@ makers makers and legislators we have a clear responsibility to provide a high level of safety for European citizens and to enable them to exercise choice .
Madam President , I can understand your desire to speed up the agenda , but my problem is that if we accept what you are proposing then it will be a set precedent for the future .
This , of course , means respecting the competences of each institution in its own field according to the treaties .
Mr President , this weekend the European Council will also discuss energy problems , which have become the issue of common security .
We as a Parliament want to see rights of children included within the Intergovernmental Conference and as part of the European Treaty .
In line with those measures , between now and 2013 , the EU , together with Member States and the private sector , will invest more than EUR 1 billion in research and innovation for the ageing society .
We should continue to demonstrate that we are willing to take action at home and internationally , that we believe that a truly global problem also requires a global solution .
I know that the Spanish Presidency is doing everything in order to bring these discussions forward .
I wish to assure you that one of the aims of the Irish presidency is to make the EU more focused , more flexible and more responsive at the United Nations .
The European Union is a political model that has helped to bring peace to our continent .
I am satisfied that this objective is met in the Council &amp; apos ; s common position .
These are obviously issues beyond the direct competence of the European Union , but would it be in our interests to provoke a political back@@ l@@ ash against the international community in the run @-@ up up to the Duma elections in December ?
. Mr President , this powerful resolution calls Parliament &amp; quot ; s attention to the fate of a beleaguered parliamentarian , Al @-@ G@@ had G@@ had opposition party leader Ay@@ man N@@ our , and requests the Egyptian authorities to respect our views .
It foresees the negotiation of association agreements , which might include deep and comprehensive free trade areas .
The answers to these difficult questions - which have ethical , scientific , social and economic aspects - must come from the whole of society .
Many Members are struggling to comprehend and understand this complex piece of legislation , made even more complex by the intervention of the Council .
For that reason I believe that European funding for European @-@ wide wide political activity , be it for or against the European Union , should be considered seriously , so long as that activity remains within the accepted parameters of Western values .
Mr President , I voted against Amendment No 5 to the Lannoye report because of assurances given by the Commission that it was not factually correct and that it had not asked developing countries for binding commitments in relation to privatis@@ ing their water industry .
What is the Commission &amp; apos ; s assessment of the EU &amp; apos ; s progress in its ability to draw on both military and humanitarian capabilities in a coordinated way ?
Can we expect that this is going to be improved ?
There are some issues that I was wary of in this report .
I voted against this report . It sends out the wrong signals .
That is something I would not want to happen .
It is a matter of basic principle : allowing the countries to assume their own responsibility and ensuring that they coordinate all the generous commitments made .
We know that the situation there is far from satisfactory .
I think it is vitally important that there should be such enterprises and I believe those contributing from within the EU can play an important role in the development of the industry in Latvia .
That is why we have decided to abstain on this resolution .
We must have a chance to debate this and to understand why the presidency of this House is proposing in one instance radically different changes to those proposed for the Commission .
It is important to be aware of it .
I would be very interested to hear whether the Commission is in favour of this amendment .
The EU can and should help here .
It is vital to the competitiveness of Europe as a whole that this industry should be a success .
As I have indicated in my previous statement , the project that is being undertaken at the moment will continue until 2003 .
Allow me to now set out briefly the Commission &amp; apos ; s approach to the points raised in the resolution .
Then we have the points about ensuring EU boats only have access to the surplus of fish not used by local fishermen .
They have torn it up , they have not shown good faith and it is now time for the Commission to cl@@ amp down really hard .
What is the Commission &amp; apos ; s view ?
It is time to translate the well meaning objectives into concrete action .
It is essential that this report be adopted today .
As I drew to the attention of the House in my statement of 29 March , the Commission is still holding discussions with the United States on this point .
The protection of a child &amp; apos ; s right to education , health and adoption are all rights that Europe as a whole should continue to recognise and protect .
However , that is not always the case and these actions can easily become a serious and unjustified impediment to our legitimate market access opportunities .
They made a mistake with their votes . It is unacceptable to recall it .
I know they are not covered by the scope of this proposal , but many of Northern Ireland &amp; apos ; s farmers feel let down when they work hard to meet the requirements laid down by Europe , and then have to compete with those who do not have to meet the same standards .
People have realised that this crisis is not of a cycli@@ cal nature and that a thorough overhaul of the regulation and supervision of financial markets is badly needed .
While reforming the CAP post 2013 it is important not to sacrifice pillar one for the sake of promoting new pillar two objectives .
It works to thwart attempts by terrorists to gain access to chemical , radi@@ ological and nuclear materials , through a strengthened Community regime of export controls on dual use , support for the efforts of the IAEA to secure vulnerable nuclear materials and tackle nuclear smuggling - which is very important - and the promotion of a worldwide nuclear security and safety culture using the substantial resources available under the stability and nuclear safety instruments .
First of all , let me thank the Parliament for the excellent work which has been done on the procedural rights .
As we indicated yesterday , the Commission is in a position to accept all the compromise amendments of the rapporteur and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that have already been adopted in the Legal Affairs Committee , that is to say Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 14 and 15 .
The reason , as I mentioned before the Lisbon Summit , relates to those who are in the gallery with us today - the citizens of Europe .
It will also take account of the importance of creating a level playing field throughout the EU for these workers and , thirdly , the importance of showing our partner countries that we are ready to provide for the fair treatment of third country nationals legally residing and working in our Member States .
The Commission should , at least , consult Parliament on this issue and it is , of course , our duty in Parliament to make sure that we develop mechanisms inside our relevant bodies , our committees , to contribute to such monitoring .
However , the Commission has the responsibility to do so while ensuring a level playing field in the European shipbuilding market and consistency in the treatment of companies under restructuring .
So we must always hold that in mind .
In conclusion , the implementation of uniform European rules can play an important pioneering role in influencing world level agreements . Parliament must take this into account when voting on this important directive .
The Council is currently considering an action plan on trafficking in human beings to develop a comprehensive and strategic European Union approach on this issue .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , and the Netherlands presidency as a whole , on the very clear orientation given on the whole issue of competitiveness and delivery of the Lisbon Agenda .
So I have a very simple question for the Commissioner .
Since then , hundreds of people have been sent@@ enced to death and many have been executed .
Then , to adopt any significant legislation , the approval of the Council is needed , amongst other things .
Next , I think that we should , when speaking about the candidate countries , avoid any conditionality which is not linked directly to their capacity to be inter@@ oper@@ able with us from the legal , institutional , political and cultural point of view and to compete with us within the internal market in the broader sense of this concept .
I welcome the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s assertion that he will be open @-@ minded minded about further suggestions we might make as a Parliament .
I was very pleased to read Mr Szymański &amp; apos ; s comments and to see that he considers that the EN@@ PI regulation is adequate and valid for the purpose of cooperation with our neighbouring countries .
Considering the indicators relating to the labour market and social protection , the structural causes of poverty have a disproportionate effect on women .
. I welcome this Council proposal and the European Parliament Report as an opportunity for legal clarity in the area of waste extraction but also as a logical way to combat the very large volumes of waste from the extrac@@ tive industries .
. My responsibility covers the structural funds .
On the question of whether the Commission will present amendments in the K@@ amp@@ ala meeting , here the answer is &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; because the EU , as such , is not a party - it is the Member States who will negotiate the amendments .
It makes a useful contribution to coordinating EU and national policies for project grants .
Can I also ask the Commissioner that if she cannot speak today , she would maybe let us have a statement in writing , because I do not believe this House is divided for one moment .
Member of the Commission . - Regarding the first question , I definitely belong to those who are not satisfied with the pace of our accession negotiations .
The Commissioner has explained to us that there has been quite intense work , with high @-@ level level meetings with interior ministers , visits to capitals , encouragement to run information campaigns - and there is a specific commitment by Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania to inform their citizens .
This resolution which , incidentally , is supported by the European Parliament and by my own country , Ireland , sets forth a new way of thinking for effective measures to forward the cause of a nuclear @-@ free free world .
Conciliation and codecision were long fought for by Parliament and were a recognition of Parliament &amp; apos ; s role .
We must be practical and sensible in our approach , but we must act .
Secondly , our ability to deliver jobs for our citizens and economic security for their families is central to our continuing success .
Our role in this House is clearly to help shape EU legislation that is appropriate and proportionate .
As the President said , both the Commission and the Council have to work very closely together in order to have a comprehensive human rights policy .
This attitude , I find , is appalling .
This is the real test of how serious you are about the principles of subsidiarity .
We in Parliament have voted an additional EUR 5 million from another budget line for institutional capacity building to frame this programme .
- Before the vote on Amendment 9@@ 38
I laugh .
Support for crisis dis@@ till@@ ation holds back competitiveness and we must abolish it completely and not try to reintroduce it through the back door .
It is a country which can be seen as a future member of the European Community .
China should also be made to do it in relation to European intellectual property .
Mr President , like other Members here today , I have been lobbied extensively about this directive and I have been impressed by the degree of support - or at least the support in principle - for it .
As I mentioned earlier , the Commission proposals are now being studied in much more detail .
Although Europe has always had its full share of varying cultures , it has also had a mainstream Christian culture or civilisation , so to speak , in which most of its people , whatever their identities , have shared .
Having said all that , I nevertheless conclude by declaring my support for this report .
But if you would permit me please , I should like to say that , whatever the view of the House on this issue , I do not appreciate the fact that almost constantly today various colleagues , in various groups , for various reasons - which may be sound - have removed our right to vote here in Strasbourg on Thursday , let alone Friday .
Thirdly , on the Rotterdam effect , as the honourable Member knows well , this issue has been discussed a lot in Holland and in Belgium recently .
As we all know , the accession negotiations will not begin until after the Intergovernmental Conference has concluded and after the Dutch presidency .
Lastly , given the initiatives about which you have spoken in the framework of the OECD and the changes by the World Bank , does the Council intend to press for new European Union procurement rules so as to prevent corruption more effectively ?
But even more confusing is the fact that none of the aforementioned territories is actually a part of the European Union .
They argue against any military action without the sanction of the United Nations Security Council .
We are often commended for our work on human rights in this House but I commend the bra@@ very and the courage of the human rights defenders whom we meet and talk to daily , who put their lives on the line for values and standards that are universal in our world and are precious to us all .
For the Commission , socio @-@ economic economic pressures are , I fear , something to be exploited rather than allevi@@ ated , because fundamentally , in pursuit of the common fisheries policy the Commission desires savage reduction in fishing effort .
These challenges can only be met if we ensure that all relevant players are closely involved in the employment strategy and that they all work together .
It should especially hold true for European citizens who have the right to move and reside freely within the EU .
Ben@@ e@@ fiting from significant inputs from the Commission , it has managed to achieve broad convergence on the Commission &amp; apos ; s legislative proposals , and also covered some other very important aspects of economic governance .
Member of the Commission . - What I said about the labelling was with regard to chick@@ en that was imported .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first , a brief remark to Mr Par@@ g@@ neaux who asked what the plan was for the next few years .
This is one of the priorities for the next mandate : to develop a greener automobile industry in Europe which is technologically more advanced .
Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I would welcome this report and the work done in particular by the rapporteur and all the others concerned to reach a first reading agreement and therefore hasten the implementation of this proposal .
I will be voting for this .
Dis@@ eased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment .
Italy has a clear legal , indeed constitutional , obligation not to return a person under extradition to countries where the death penalty still exists .
You will elect a new president and a different Member State will be se@@ ated here as the presidency representing the Council .
rapporteur . - Mr President , it is only about one year since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which envisages considerable changes in the delegation of powers by the European Parliament and Council to the Commission .
There are different views on that matter .
It is understood that a limited treaty change implies the use of the simplified revision procedure based on Article 48 of the Treaty .
Democracy , the rule of law , human rights and fundamental freedoms are key principles that the European Union applies even @-@ handedly handedly to all its partners .
I believe it is a big step forward in the cooperation between the European Union and Tajikistan , which is a very important country for several reasons .
The Commission will therefore now undertake work to outline a path@@ way up to 2050 for the European Union &amp; apos ; s transition to becoming a low @-@ carbon carbon economy .
I should like to ask you , Sir , through your good offices , to see whether you could get it put on to the agenda , because this could be a very important sector for the creation of growth , both in employment and economic terms , and would actually stop jobs leaving the European Union .
No European Union worthy of its name can be complete unless we take these countries in , and these programmes are a very good way to go forward .
Mr President , I should like to warmly welcome this report by Mrs Car@@ lo@@ tti and congratulate her on her very thorough and far @-@ reaching reaching work .
We require a far more formal decision @-@ making making procedure of a parliamentary type .
What is needed in this situation is resuming the political dialogue and finding a compromise in the interests of the people and democracy in the country .
The Commission , along with two separate studies commissioned by Parliament , points to a series of problems , some of them being breaches of the core rights of EU citizens .
I would just like to raise two related issues .
I would regret it if it has to be referred back to committee .
It also emphasises the importance of relevant support to developing countries in their prevention and mitigation work to limit the negative effects of climate change .
The proposal to shorten Strasbourg sessions to four days would have meant that MEPs could have been back in their constituencies for longer periods meeting groups , individuals and organisations and getting across the message about what we do here in Strasbourg and Brussels .
I have an additional question . In the European Parliament , we are currently working on the future European investment policy .
Mr President , this House has repeatedly condemned human rights abuses in many parts of Indonesia over the years and some appalling crimes have taken place in that beautiful country .
author . - Mr President , a large number of opposition figures , including former presidential candidates but also journalists and human rights defenders , were arrested after the events of 19 December 2010 in Minsk and they have been kept in KGB detention centres ever since .
However , if we are to have more Europe , there is a requirement for more resources .
I hope that when these debates are held in future without my attendance they will , if I may say so , have as broad a base as possible in the points of view we hear .
The decision has to be made at Member State level in order to ensure a uniform application of any rules laid down .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s annual report is a serious and significant contribution to the European Union &amp; apos ; s equality debate at the end of the Tw@@ enti@@ eth C@@ en@@ tury .
I hope that the Foreign Ministers and Prime Minister Blair will impress on their guests the need for transatlantic understanding to flow both ways .
This right needs to be balanced against an individuals right to access to information and , furthermore , sanctions should only be targeted at the larger commercial exploit@@ ers of copyright material .
The political difference is that under the last article there are some Member States that have the right to opt out of the regulation .
It is about pe@@ ak oil and what that will do to developing countries &amp; apos ; opportunities ; it is about meeting the Millennium Development Goals .
Mr President , I come to this debate today with a lot of reservations because of some of the comments made by other speakers in a previous debate .
There are other aspects , but trade is a very important one , and there is a feasibility study on trade already on the way .
It further condemns the attacks on civilians as documented by the International Cri@@ sis Group .
Mr President , as mentioned in 1989 , the Council and the Commission agreed that they had to address the harmonisation of the regulatory framework applicable to civil aviation in order to maintain a high level of safety and to ensure fair competition in the internal market .
But they will also tell us that what we do , we must do better .
We made clear at the outset of our Presidency that we were keen to seek to make some progress on this issue , and that progress is ongoing .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for all her hard work on this report .
The sensitivity of the issue arises because we are having a referendum in Ireland to make a political decision , and a cowardly political tactic to blame Europe for the Government &amp; apos ; s decision runs the risk of alien@@ ating all the parents in Ireland against Europe .
But it is fair to give warning that we believe that the Government of Turkey has yet to deliver on the promises made to this Parliament before the ratification of the customs union in December last year .
We are no longer an institution limited to giving assent and this is not the way Parliament wants to work with the recast in the future .
I wonder whether in their summing @-@ up up replies both Minister de Mi@@ gu@@ el and Commissioner Verheugen might refer to progress , as far as public opinion is concerned , and any further initiatives they have in mind .
However , there are some basic differences of opinion which must be emphasized , the importance of which should not be underestimated .
That said , I hope that we can engage the United States at a much earlier stage in the policy @-@ making making process in discussing these security issues .
I believe that the next step is to pursue bolder and more substantial policies of territorial , economic and social cohesion in Europe - and not fewer policies of this kind - together with bold reforms , financial and economic reforms which would allow us not to repeat the crisis , and , certainly , with policies for post @-@ crisis crisis rehabilitation .
It is not the responsibility of the Commission alone .
It is not for me at this stage to present any further proposals , but rather to respond to any amendments that might be tabled by the House or indeed by the Council of Ministers .
As an investigative body within the Commission , OLAF can only provide a platform for cooperation , and it is absolutely clear that value added tax fraud can only be fought in cooperation between Member States and the European Commission , because , basically , major fraud can only happen cross @-@ border border .
The aim of the rapporteur to come to an agreement with the other institutions has our full support , and it has had the full support of all the groups from the very start .
We need to concentrate on progressive decision @-@ making making for the benefit of all European citizens .
It does not mean it is the end of the matter .
The first meeting with Mercosur took place last week in Buenos Aires .
Finally , I raised awareness about the need to evaluate the impact on the credit rating of the European Union since it acted as guarantor of the European financial stabilisation mechanism .
I turn now in particular to the Occupied Palestinian Territory .
For example , low quality of recycling , a high proportion of recovered energy or highly mixed waste can influence environmental performance .
It is a good working document and we have a good basis to start working , so I congratulate the Commission as well .
I think it is a timely reminder from Berlin and from the Spring Summit that the Commission needs to relaunch a social agenda with content because , looking at the Commission &amp; apos ; s work programme at the moment , it seems to have forgotten that it has any legal bases to allow it to act at all .
The report concerns a long @-@ awaited awaited proposal for a directive which is crucial for facilitating the free movement of persons and which takes into account the work carried out at the end of the 1990s , in particular by the high level panel chaired by Mrs Sim@@ one V@@ eil , on citizenship of the European Union .
Economic and social analyses are also important in this process and the Commission will accompany all proposals for management plans with impact assessments where economic , social and environmental aspects of the proposals will be analysed .
So , apart from all the other difficulties highlighted by the rapporteur - and I do not have time to list them - it seems that we in Ireland do not have the legal certainty to comprehensively enforce this directive .
I am Polish , and we in Eastern Europe know how important these types of actions are for the establishment of democracy .
Fri@@ days in Strasbourg are a difficult issue for us , but today because of the sensitivity of the report - it raises issues about the general procedure of the House and our general relationship with the Commission - I personally think it would be better if the groups had an opportunity to vote when there were more Members present .
I was disappointed , but at the same time we have to be realistic .
I will provide a general answer by saying that this is indeed a key aspect of free movement of people and of effective citizenship in the Union .
The final report was adopted by a large majority .
I support the action for growth initiative , which will ensure that the research and development investment target of 3 % of GDP within the European Union must be met by the year 2010 .
It is in those circumstances that the authority of such an agency will perme@@ ate throughout the European Union and will not only be a good authority in the area of safety and public health but will also provide a degree of consumer confidence that I believe is absolutely essential and will be a bedrock in the way forward .
in writing . - The past 12 months have seen the deterioration of the dairy market with prices of milk falling below 21 cents per litre and leaving many farmers with no alternative but to sell dairy products at a loss .
May I also ask you to change all other reports referring to the proposed Constitution or the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Among other things , it is a matter of a coherent approach to policy making , and I think that in this area , international trade can also contribute to international peace .
If we really want to combat climate change and not just develop measures which have nothing to do with the environment , we should accept the overall carbon stock of forests as a carbon sink .
It will give us ideas and inspir@@ ations on how we can proceed with this important issue in the future .
I cannot support the report .
This is why the Commission sees the maritime policy , and especially its environmental pillar , the Marine Strategy Directive , as key to the implementation of an ecosystem approach .
Cap@@ acity needs to be managed so as to be in balance with the productivity of the fish stocks .
It is the terrorists and their apolog@@ ists that are the biggest abusers of the human rights of our citizens .
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect , which has not been examined well enough in this debate . It is like so much European legislation .
We prefer actions in a coordinated way .
I would ask you , in a g@@ ent@@ le way , to point this out to the President of Parliament .
Much in the reports on which we have just voted - the Kaufmann , França , B@@ rej@@ c , Weber and Lambert reports - is there to give force to aspects of policy , to initiatives and , in the case of Eurojust , to an entire institution , that have no proper legal mandate .
We are all well aware of the figures - thousands of people across Europe require organ trans@@ plants every year .
We need to wait for the final result , as we have done in other similar negotiations , before we look at our own legal base .
We have partners in the entire world with whom we are united by strong cultural and economic ties .
I think it is a very alarming prospect that we could have rogue use by a rogue state selling nuclear technology to rogue elements .
While I support calls to ensure that imports from third countries are produced in a manner consistent with EU standards , an EU @-@ Mercosur Mercosur Association Agreement will have negative consequences for agriculture in Europe , particularly our livestock sector .
The next generation will deal with it .
I should like to make three brief points in response to that .
Also , while I acknowledge that proposals are evolving all the time , it seems to me that as a coordinating body for best practice , there is a danger of duplicating the efforts of other coordinating bodies and thereby failing to make a sufficiently positive contribution .
Why , for example , have fewer summits if there are going to be more rather than fewer issues to discuss ?
I am afraid , therefore , that the British Conservatives will not be able to support this report .
Since 2002 the Commission has allocated on that line more than EUR 8@@ 6.@@ 2 million to NGOs as a contribution to 25 projects combating HIV / AIDS being implemented in 16 African countries .
It is a violation of human rights and unacceptable in all circumstances , and I am pleased Parliament has endorsed this motion with such great support .
I , of course , agree that the internal market for the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital should operate in an even @-@ handed handed manner .
Both its supporters and its opponents see it as a symbol .
May I assure you of the Commission &amp; apos ; s willingness to look again at the various points in this report in close cooperation with Parliament .
You have the information and I suggest that it is not right to allow proper contributions while people are coming into the chamber .
It is known that the vast majority of countries from eastern and central Europe want to sign up to the process of economic and monetary union in as short a time as possible , but I believe that the European Central Bank has to outline a clear strategy as to how it intends to bolster the value of the new euro .
The potential benefits of European contract law for the Internal Market have been discussed in the interinstitutional framework and with the broad public for a many years , and Parliament pronounced for the first time on the issue in 1989 .
Finally , let me conclude by making two statements which the Commission agrees to make in relation to the adoption of this report .
Simultan@@ eously , many Member States should strengthen the role which social dialogue has in setting the policy .
The Commission , together with the Member States and other international actors , is committed to helping at this critical juncture .
It can bring benefits and it should be considered carefully with proper risk assessment and risk management , but without scaremongering .
So we think we are moving forward on this , but we will see - when we get , maybe , an indication from the Commission about how we are going to increase cooperation between Member States - just how far we will be able to get with this proposal .
I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate , indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules .
Ar@@ rang@@ ements for cooperation between national supervisors will have to be put in place .
As such , I am impressed by the degree to which the Dess report has committed to greening CAP ; to supporting small- and medium @-@ sized sized food producers ; and to looking towards the future while also addressing the current concerns which face European agriculture .
That is unfortunate .
Next summer when we face Europe &amp; apos ; s citizens in elections we could have a Parliament with its own House in order , its Members across Europe treated and respected equally and on a transparent basis , or we could continue with the current disgraceful mix and mu@@ d@@ dle which leaves us all open to ridicule .
Are we to tell these countries that we do not want their products for the reasons that we have discussed here this afternoon ?
Can I just add a couple of things that , ideally , we should not do .
Not having it would be a problem for the future of Europe and for our ambitions .
It is violence . When pornographi@@ c material can be just disturbing then viewing very vivid images of violence against others or even self @-@ harm harm is something that really might provoke you@@ ths for though@@ tless acts .
I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate - grateful but sad that the debate is necessary at all .
The EU should seek positively to raise standards of protection of citizens &amp; quot ; rights and a culture of respect for fundamental freedoms in order to create the mutual trust necessary for mutual recognition .
However , at the same time , we do not want to work with the government - or at least , we want to work as little as we can with it .
We will now make every effort to get agreement on these texts within the timescale specified by the Amsterdam Treaty .
We need to be absolutely clear on the status and treatment of people who are excluded from international procedure , but who are non @-@ remo@@ vable remo@@ vable from EU territory owing to any of the different reasons which may lead to this status .
We attach much importance to their admission and we will continue working with our US counterparts on resolving this issue .
This is a major achievement , and it is only fair to congratulate Prime Minister Topolánek on his constructive role as a Council .
The Commission expects the Member States to take this guidance into account when they draft their stability or convergence programmes and the national reform programmes under the Europe 2020 Strategy .
I believe that the international community , and particularly the European Union , must maintain its dialogue with Iran &amp; quot ; s new government .
It was widely anticipated that the elimination of exchange rate risks between the currencies of Member States within the euro zone would lead to a reduction in the costs involved in conversion transactions between these currencies .
If you want the Commission to continue to do as has been done over the last number of years , just tell me , and I will come with a proposal every week .
The Commission , as I have said before , is not a silent and dis@@ interested on@@ loo@@ ker in this debate .
On the unfair commercial practices , we argued for an internal market clause and it was voted through .
However , we do acknowledge that protection - the legitimate use of measures to protect sensitive sectors and emerging industry - is a valid and essential policy tool .
That is why at the moment the Commission is reflecting on how to revitalise this process in order to identify the immediate priorities for the Commission action to match the recent political and industrial progress .
The scale and European @-@ wide wide nature of this problem have been tragically highlighted by these ep@@ is@@ odes and it is up to us as a European Community to respond far better than we have done he@@ re@@ to@@ fore .
It is to the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s credit that we have come this far , but we have a very long way to go .
Furthermore , I really would ask Members to think very carefully before they stand up in this public chamber and accuse anybody , never mind a President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , of being a li@@ ar .
We have continued to make it clear to the Turkish authorities that observance of the rule of law and basic liberties is the basis of continued rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey .
I thank colleagues for their support and urge them to support this report tomorrow , and I wish everybody a H@@ app@@ y Christmas .
This will surely bring more value and political weight to debates about sport in the European Union and also to developments surrounding cooperation .
It was never our expectation that we would find complete agreement in So@@ chi , but the Summit did clarify our respective positions . That was extremely helpful as we prepare for the European Council discussions on the external aspects of EU energy policy on the basis of the joint paper by the Commission and the High Representative .
But where is the solidarity in the disgraceful way that , one after another , 13 Member States have signalled they will impose restrictions on free movement from new Eastern Member States ?
We cannot accept Amendment No 5 , nor the first part of Amendment No 7 .
. Thank you for your contributions to this important debate .
The additional point reminding the Commission of the need for a coherent industrial policy and of the role social partners have to play should be noted .
Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the future of cohesion policy , which is of crucial importance to old and new Member States alike .
But in order to develop and reach its full potential , the sector needs an appropriate regulatory framework , and this is actually what we are trying to achieve with our new regulation .
I do not wish to comment on all of the 66 amendments put forward to my report , but I would say that this is a very complicated area .
. I voted in favour of the Charter and agree that we should not be opposed to the rights enumerated within it .
With this in mind , we have carried out diplomatic démarches to prepare the ground for a successful outcome of the Geneva meeting .
When we speak about a social Europe , the most important aspect of that is our responsibility to those who are most vulnerable within our society .
The whole point of the M@@ A@@ GP is to reduce fishing effort and bring it into better balance with the existing fish stocks .
That was the deal we reached with Parliament and the Council when adopting the revised Financial Regulation .
Specifically , how quickly will we be able to utilise this mechanism in the case of serious market disruption ?
I will show you the scoreboard on the implementation of the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices and you will be surprised that even the champions of consumer protection failed in the transposition of this particular directive .
We all have high expectations , and rightly so , because the future of the European Union also depends greatly on the future development of the scientific and research field .
Many of them have scant respect for human rights and democracy including Cuba , China , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Ni@@ car@@ agu@@ a and G@@ ab@@ on - and Iran , as a potential candidate - to name just a few .
By mainstreaming health into all EU policies , by conducting extended health impact assessments and evaluations on all EU legislation and by promoting healthy lifesty@@ les , the EU can provide the necessary platform for joined @-@ up up thinking across its Member States .
I do not wish to make any political points because it would be very difficult to find a common political point in this group ; but I do want to point out what unites all the members of the Non @-@ attached attached Group , which is that we look to you for fairness , we look to you for reasonable treatment , we look to you to recognise people in this part of the House when they speak and we look to you to recognise that although many of us may be aw@@ kward , we are nonetheless democrats and we nonetheless wish to play a part in the workings of this House .
I regard that not just as a discourtesy to the Commission , but these are crucial issues , and if we want to be engaged with those issues , perhaps you would explain to me and to Parliament why those chairs were empty .
Commissioner , I know that you and your staff are fully aware that this is a controversial proposal that merits further examination in a number of areas .
The parliamentary assembly is a very special institution : it is the democratic arm of ACP @-@ EU EU cooperation and provides a voice for the people in the 93 countries which are represented there .
However , it misses one major strategic point and that arises from the fact that European citizens are very much more concerned about GMOs and their potential effects than other populations , particularly in North America .
This state of affairs necessarily has implications for Cyprus and Malta &amp; quot ; s participation in EU @-@ NATO NATO meetings , as well as in some internal EU meetings .
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
It is clear that some people lead what appear to be complicated lives .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I think that the debate today once again has clearly shown that we have genuine concerns over the situation in Tibet .
Nevertheless , it must be acknowledged that there is still a lot to be done in order to have real and active partnership and governance , not only in the preparation and negotiation process but also in the other phases of the life of the operational programmes , that is : implementation , monitoring and evaluation .
Europe needs an inclusive , outward @-@ looking looking approach if racism is to be comb@@ ated .
So I think that is settled .
On the third question , the priority of the Commission is to ensure correct and consistent implementation of the directive .
I wish to remind colleagues that any common position on foreign policy would be determined by the Member States represented in the Council , not by the Commission , and certainly not by this Parliament .
It is time that you , and the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , should go to Kyoto and offer some of the lessons which we have learned in the European Union , as well as our recommendations on timetables and targets because we will need an institution in order to manage implementation , emissions trading and the rest .
Let me now turn to some of the concrete measures which will be taken .
In closing what will be my final speech in this Chamber for this mandate as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I would like to thank all of the Members of this House for their cooperation in moving forward the number of dossiers we have in this area of work in the last five years ; and you too , Commissioner , for your valued cooperation .
However , apart from this annual exercise , the ECB and the European Parliament have established several other contacts .
It was a report where I agreed with the rapporteur on the main points , namely that access to the data entered into the customs information system is to be ensured only to specifically designated bodies and staff like the Member States , Europol and Eurojust .
I would like to mention the continuing campaign against discrimination , in the hope that real progress will be made on the European Gender Institute and on the recast equality directive .
Having discussed this with Mrs Roth @-@ Ber@@ end@@ t Ber@@ end@@ t , we have tabled Amendment No 51 to Article 5 as a compromise to this effect .
But we must also recognize that process will be immensely difficult .
Let me just take a slightly different tac@@ k to that pursued by a number of the previous speakers .
That is my starting point .
They are focused on developing the political and institutional relationship with the European Union .
However , progress is being made , albeit slowly , and should be acknowledged .
Clearly , for a framework agreement to come about there would need to be unanimity among Union Members on the way that the code would work .
It is so important to keep in the European Union , both for the European Union and , above all , for consumers who want safe , effective and affordable medicines .
This calls on Member States to develop national strategies for coastal zone management based on an inventory of the actors , laws and institutions involved in the management and planning of the coastal zones .
We have two parallel lines for our relationships with the United States today .
Although I realise and I am grateful that the desire to have the votes or minutes published by the Governing Council does not appear in the motion for a resolution which will be voted on tomorrow by your Parliament , in this discussion a lot of attention , much more than I expected , was paid to the phenomenon of transparency , culmin@@ ating in publishing the vote .
We must not be pom@@ pou@@ s , hypocritical or self @-@ serving serving about this .
This is crucial as SMEs make up 99 % of all European enterprises , but the sector is suffering in the current climate .
I believe it is crucial that , on the one hand , we try to stimulate the potential of Member States which are less developed , smaller and maybe do not have the potential to compete on an equal basis today .
I hope that , when the final joint EU trade strategy is adopted over the summer , it will also be reflected in that strategy document .
It is crucial for the long term viability of the livestock sector overall that the Commission ensure that their actions on trade and agriculture do not compromise European farmers , but support the sustainability and viability of the European livestock sector into the future .
We want speedy and specific action from the Commission in response to those judgments and then time to sensibly revise other provisions in the original directive .
The European Parliament and the Council have adopted Directive 2004 / 48 / EC , which puts in place a Community framework for the enforcement of intellectual property rights and are currently working on a proposal for a directive on criminal measures , aimed at ensuring enforcement of such rights .
I think it is really up to us to deliver now : Parliament , Council and Commission .
These proposals , taken as a whole , represent a highly delicate and complex compromise which the Commission fully supports , as does European industry .
Indeed , the priorities too will be fairly similar to those which have been put in the draft budget of the Commission .
This is a major step forward for the European Union which the Commission , as you know , has been strongly promoting .
Member States have also announced or taken initiatives with regard to the possibility of using state aid .
The choice of a third @-@ pillar pillar legal base , coupled with its interim character , leaves Parliament - and , therefore , EU citizens - completely out of the legislative process .
Mr President , most people would now say that they want the European Union to play a stronger role in world affairs , but they appear sometimes to be uncertain as to the ways and means .
Mr President , some of the best questions are raised late in the evening and this is one of them , although there is an element of &amp; apos ; the dialogue of the deaf &amp; apos ; because we do not have the Council here to hear this debate .
Our message to Russia , however , is that security and defence policy needs to be seen as part of our broader political dialogue that also covers some of the present &amp; quot ; frozen conflicts &amp; quot ; in Europe , notably Trans@@ d@@ ni@@ es@@ tri@@ a , which is a source of tremendous instability for Moldova , a future European Union neighbour .
This is an issue that will have to be resolved if the European Union is to have any effective role in the region .
The Commission also agrees that it may be useful to clarify and emphasise this point directly in one of the paragraphs of the proposal .
This is a reminder to all European Parliament delegations that all of them are entitled and obliged to exercise their duty in respect of human rights when they visit countries .
The French cannot have another referendum , because that might lead to an English referendum , and of course we all know that the British would reject the new Constitution - oh , sorry - &amp; apos ; Treaty &amp; apos ; .
. The Commission &amp; apos ; s Directorate @-@ General General for Development , and I myself , are aware of the Cle@@ an Development Mechanism and the opportunities it offers .
President of the Commission . - The European Central Bank ( ECB ) is certainly independent , and not only is its independence recognised by the Treaty - so it is therefore legal and Treaty @-@ based based independence - but I can also tell you that I have had some seven years &amp; apos ; experience in this position , dealing very frequently with the ECB and being present on many occasions when the ECB has shown it does not need our support to affirm its independence .
It must be a restatement of and a re@@ commitment to our values and ambitions , looking to the future for an enlarged Europe .
I hope that Parliament will understand that the Commission cannot agree to give commitments on timescales which cannot be reasonably kept .
If the latter , then there are a few things we are going to have to do .
Can we make a difference ?
I want to congratulate Mrs Marin@@ u@@ c@@ ci on what she has had to say about these matters for our committee and , indeed , for the Parliament .
By insisting on better pay , the EU is also ensuring that there is a market in third party countries for EU exports .
Mr President , very briefly I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very full and comprehensive reply to the vast majority of the points made by myself as rapporteur and by other Members .
Mr President , when I spoke this morning in the Iraq debate I drew attention to the self @-@ interested interested agenda of France , a nation for which I have great affec@@ tion , but whose foreign policy has some very dangerous elements .
in writing . - Conservative MEPs have voted against both of Mr Corbett &amp; apos ; s proposed amendments to raise the threshold for the establishment of political groups in the European Parliament .
The committee which I have the honour to chair adopted Mrs Karamanou &amp; apos ; s report nearly unanimously .
Let us have an honest debate about it rather than hide within the Tro@@ jan Hor@@ se of supposed healthcare issues .
Parliament has shown an active interest in this subject for some time .
We must maintain the clear difference in substance of the tasks at hand for either party .
None the less , I am happy to give the undertaking that I will pass on that suggestion to the Commission .
For that reason the most important elements of this report are the need to have harmonisation of measurement and assessment methods across the whole of the European Union so we can talk in comparable terms about the problems .
Whether they choose to play the Que@@ en of H@@ ear@@ ts or the A@@ ce of S@@ pa@@ des in President Barroso &amp; apos ; s House of C@@ ards is up to them , but I remain convinced that Romania and Bulgaria will be an asset to the Union , and not a burden as some would have us believe .
While Eurobonds may be regarded as a clever idea which can deliver funds to governments , there seems no legal base on which this can be achieved , so it looks unlikely that this option can be exercised .
This was one of the most protracted issues and difficult elements of the negotiations .
On energy , the great worry of my group , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , is that the European Union is in danger of being held hostage .
Moreover , such arrangements are considered to be an important step forward , aiming at establishing better communication ties and creating political dialogue on a cultural , economical and political level .
I was very encouraged by President Abbas &amp; apos ; s call for an immediate end to this internal violence , because Qassam rockets from Gaza have to stop once and for all .
The market outlook report in the dairy sector will be adopted by the Commission later this year and it will provide us with the basis for a further discussion on whether we need to increase again the quota .
Because of this , when it comes to the Interim Trade Agreement , in our resolution we can only highlight our points and raise our concerns and give support with regard to certain topics ; but because of this Parliament , and specifically my political group , is hesi@@ tating in giving its full support for the Interim Trade Agreement .
The objective of this continual tor@@ rent of legislation is to harmonise every aspect of life in the European Union and bring it under the ultimate authority of the European Union .
It has signalled politically that we need to be concerned in the medium term about some of the pension systems and we share that concern politically .
Of course , it is vital that such a system is complemented by a strictly compliant system including provisions for cases of non @-@ compliance compliance .
I welcome the overall compromise that has been agreed by all political groups and I believe that this is an important step forward for all consumers in the European Union .
His fellow F@@ ren@@ ch@@ men rejected the EU Constitution , yet it is an essential ingredient of his report .
Of course we have such differences as between one institution and another , and as political families with a clear view of where we want Europe to go in the future .
The Commission coordinated this exercise , and provided the results of the first phase of the investigation in November 2007 .
However , the Commission believes that the formulation now proposed by the European Parliament not only would refine the political priorities of the IDA programme and increase its transparency but also could be expected to remove the objections raised by the Council in the first reading .
We had to build up institutions , see them in place and functioning , confer on them power originating in their legitimacy and function@@ ality .
For that reason I understand that this issue is going back to one of the Councils before the end of this year for finalisation , having regard to what Parliament said today and what Parliament will vote on and decide tomorrow .
They are particularly concerned that the traditional , consensual , decision @-@ making making process of the EU is being abandoned in favour of a system whereby larger Member States will exercise power at the expense of smaller countries .
These are clearly very critical issues for us to discuss .
Fortunately , after the work between the shadow rapporteurs and excellent cooperation , as well as the good work by the Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency , we came to an acceptable solution that now works and which keeps markets open , increases transparency and ensures that European investors can continue to invest in markets outside the EU .
Secondly , one says , let us find ways of ending the causes of violence , and the biggest cause is poverty .
Although I recognise the strategic importance of this region to the EU , I believe that continued engagement on the EU &amp; apos ; s part must be matched by advances in human rights and democratisation in Central Asia .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , first of all , I will not dwell on Mr Voggenhuber &amp; apos ; s excellent report except to say that my group will support it wholeheartedly .
On 2 April 2009 the European Parliament voted in favour of the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal under the consultation procedure , and discussions on the draft directive are ongoing in the Council .
Such an initiative would , in my view , restore not only consumer confidence in food but also public confidence in the EU itself .
As you know , we are now at the initial stage of reflection on the future of cohesion policy .
While I wholly support the subsidiarity principle and the sovereign right of Member States to set their own tax rates , I would suggest to Member States which have not as yet taken advantage of the facility for lower tax rates on labour @-@ intensive intensive , loc@@ alised industries , to seriously consider doing so .
A@@ war@@ eness @-@ raising raising among women on the importance of screening has been a key part of European action against cancer .
Not only the Community but all Member States have signed the Aarhus Convention and so already have to take into account the soft @-@ law law provisions .
This Parliament needs to review the manner in which the Council deals with Question Time in this House .
Who are the United States to decide , for political reasons , that a democratically @-@ elected elected Member of this Parliament is not allowed to enter ?
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would first like to warmly thank the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and , in particular , the rapporteur , Mr Christian Ehler , for supporting the policy set out in our communication .
But there are conditions which must be met to avoid some fairly obvious and serious pitfalls .
Yes , we must achieve a balance on privacy , on the retention of data and the use of data , but not to the point where we hand the terrorists and criminals an advantage that undermines our own way of life and gives them the opportunity to commit further atrocities .
As regards the an@@ alo@@ gy on the mac@@ ke@@ rel situation , what I can say here is that the European Union has done its best .
We are not claiming that this or that is the best option .
The difficulty is that everyone has some justification for taking action , but there is no acceptable justification for dis@@ placing tens of thousands of innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians .
The most recent re @-@ evaluation evaluation of the common position in June this year re @-@ affirmed affirmed the policy of constructive engagement as the basis of EU policy towards Cuba .
I would conclude by saying that this is the European Year of Cre@@ ativity and Innovation , and that it is very important to have an approach which brings forward the creative potential of our businesses .
This directive has already paved the way forward by asking the Commission to submit this year three initiatives : a third report on the application of the Po@@ stal Directive , a prospective study about the impact of competitive postal markets on universal postal services , and a proposal on the future of EU postal policy .
We must be realistic , because we know the discussion and the position and attitude among the Member States : they are not willing to give the European Union more competence in this area .
I ask the Turkish Government and the Turkish people to see the need for this .
As well as this , in terms of MiFID wai@@ vers , the European Parliament and the Commission agree that these need to be redefined and their implementation needs to be standardised across the EU .
With others in this debate , I have personally spoken with representatives of the Israeli Government , representatives of the Palestinian Authority and , in Gaza itself , representatives of the commission set up by the de facto authority , to plead with them to cooperate with Goldstone and to undertake their own credible and independent investigations to bring to account those responsible for violations .
That is not unusual .
Unless we are able to establish a proper system of international cooperation in this area then we will not be able to deal effectively with these issues .
I support the social dimension in Europe , but it has got to be one that enhances our competitive challenge for today &amp; quot ; s world .
Lin@@ ked to this , I have also noticed that you would like to see a double legal basis for this proposal .
We need the fishermen &amp; apos ; s support , we need to ensure that the programmes work properly , and that means local control with the fishermen &amp; apos ; s involvement rather than too much heavy bureaucracy .
It could result in fishermen being penalised for the acts or omissions of their government and would thus constitute vic@@ arious punishment .
But the amendments require no change to the proposal .
A central challenge facing Europe continues to be competitiveness .
This is the result of our s@@ quali@@ d attempts at appe@@ as@@ ement and we must do something to stop it .
Tomorrow , the Commission will discuss and endorse the results of the screening exercise and put forward the list of legislative proposals it considers should be withdrawn .
I very much hope and indeed encourage the House to approve our version of the report tomorrow because it addresses a number of the issues that the Commission asked us to address and it was not intended as the fore@@ runner of the PSE Group &amp; apos ; s manifesto for the forthcoming elections .
The Socialist Group , of whom I am the spokesman , will be supporting it in its entirety and without amendment .
If we could be a bit more sophisticated I believe we have a chance of making a success of the imminent discussions .
I think your idea , rapporteur , of an annual tripartite meeting between Parliament , Council and Commission to review what we have done in the course of the action is an excellent one .
There is a need for EU Member States to maintain overseas development assistance ( ODA ) .
Most Members support these efforts and the view of the Commission that it should take on more responsibility , especially in the crisis situation which we spoke about earlier - it is then that we understand how much we need the European Union and action from the Commission .
The provisions of the Treaty of Nice cannot come into effect until the ratification process has been concluded within the 15 Member States of the Union .
Our allies in the United States are heavily committed in the fight against terrorism and we should do everything reasonable to support them .
Unfortunately this will not change following the Treaty of Nice .
- Mr President , I shall open the discussion on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy .
In the preparation now of the common agricultural policy for post 2013 , and in the light of the results of the ongoing negotiations on climate change , the Commission will examine ways to further and better integrate adaptation and mitigation objectives in the common agriculture policy instruments .
You cannot cher@@ ry@@ pick in negotiations , this is part of an overall settlement of some extremely complicated issues and I think the Commission is absolutely right to let these things flow through carefully in the hope that by doing so we can secure what all of us want and that is a secure and just and durable peace in the Middle East .
Although youth policy in Europe is carried out at national level , we need to learn from each other and set examples .
I am pleased that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ( ECON ) has adopted a draft resolution approving the Commission &amp; apos ; s initiative , and I hope that the plenary will take the same supportive line .
This is an example of how much can be achieved when all the institutions work well together .
In America , on the other hand , only the largest international banks will have to comply .
The European Union is founded on the principles of liberty , democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law , principles which are common to the Member States .
The Council has to prepare a statement on the progress made by the EU since the report in 1995 by this Parliament on the NPT and , indeed , the many resolutions since then .
I am absolutely convinced , intellectually and politically , that , if Europe does not act in a concerted manner , we risk having only an insignificant role at international level in the future .
Given the opportunity and a favourable community infrastructure , the citizens of rural Europe are actively participating in enterprise programmes , creating much @-@ needed needed employment and contributing to the sustainability of rural communities .
I therefore urge the Commission to come forward with more concrete legislative proposals and the Member States to show more commitment .
On the contrary , I would regard it as a great benefit and advantage of the report that it is a very sensible compromise between two desires , two considerations , one of which is to have a wide range of opinion and expertise working in the subcommittees , while the other is to have a clear line of responsibility between the subcommittees and their principal committees .
Finally , if you look at paragraph 25 of my report you will see that we are asking for an appropriate legal framework in each new service , balancing the interests and responsibilities of providers , consumers and the Member States alike on the experience of over 75 years of regulation in radio and television @-@ broadcasting broadcasting .
I would ask the presidency to make it quite clear that we do not approve , and fundamentally oppose such conduct .
Thank you for placing this very important debate on the agenda .
Rather , we should focus on what in my view is the far more important issue of proper policing of the regulations and ensuring that the rules are as practical and as workable as they can be .
We reject the view that only Member State governments should evaluate their own choices of research and other activities .
This is a practical approach .
I think it is important to say that this country is now coming closer to membership , which underlines - and I say this to the Presidency of the Council - that there is a need to finalise the negotiations with Croatia during 2010 .
I would like to thank Mrs Pack in particular for the commitment and expertise she has brought to the report .
I regret the fact that the Commission has not to date made the gesture of withdrawing its letter of formal notice to the Danish Government .
Parliament has legitimate concerns and a strongly felt point of view .
I would also like to highlight the L@@ EA@@ D@@ ER programme in this context , which contributes to improving the involvement of women in the decision @-@ making making process in the local action groups .
Mr Mitchell &amp; apos ; s report draws our attention to the rules that give Member States the responsibility for exchange rate policy , and calls on Eurozone finance ministers to coordinate their influence on the exchange rate with the European Central Bank .
Furthermore , the Ombudsman &amp; apos ; s proposals to the European Convention include the idea that the Charter should be legally binding wherever Community law applies .
We must be clear in our call for full respect for the freedom and the rights that are there for every human being in our world .
However , there are still areas for improvement .
Mr President , on the Péry report , I am most am@@ a@@ zed .
I am delighted to say that the Committee on Petitions had a recent meeting with the Danish presidency at which the presidency expressed its willingness to look at the new interinstitutional agreement .
This does not preclude the possibility , of course , that critical questions may be raised by Member States in the Council .
What instead remains is a Committee of the Regions whose own freedom from responsibility is called into question by the majority of the Committee on Budgets &amp; quot ; members .
I believe that if this is done , the Amsterdam Summit will be seen as an historic landmark in the development of Europe , not only because of the new European Treaty but also because it puts jobs at the top of Europe &amp; apos ; s agenda .
Mr President , Europe will gain the support of its citizens by coming up with practical initiatives that respond to what they expect from us .
Mr President , I was a little bit surprised to hear the rapporteur introduce the report by saying that the most radical ideas were not included , quite the opposite .
Some of our countries in the West are not free from blame for this situation .
The strategy proposed by the Commission is rather weak and has no deadlines or targets .
Indeed the solution for the euro is to recognise the need for full political discipline in combination with full market discipline .
We have failed to send an immediate response when it was most obviously required , and this proposal is part of Commissioner Patten &amp; apos ; s p@@ rais@@ e@@ worthy efforts to improve the Union &amp; apos ; s aid programme , which is in a bit of a mess , to say the least .
Our national tradition of rights is not merely different from the European conception of universal entitlements ; it is incompatible .
I do apologise again for the fact that I have to leave before the conclusion of this debate , which I am taking part in , as you can see , at very short notice .
However , as the President of a young democratic country , I cannot fall victim to the feeling of self @-@ satisfaction satisfaction with this rare political consensus .
With the new EU @-@ ACP ACP Convention being successfully concluded a few months ago and with the EU @-@ South South Africa cooperation agreement now being implemented as planned , we have two very important additions to the MEDA cooperation and the Barcelona process .
This will speed up negotiations within Parliament and with the other institutions once we have received formal proposals .
Is that an area where we should go for detailed regulation , with guarantees that will be implemented everywhere or should we consider whether a voluntary agreement , provided that it can be enforced and controlled , as an alternative ?
Improving the regulatory environment to obtain concrete benefits for operators and citizens is a joint responsibility of the European institutions and the Member States .
Take , for instance , research and development and innovation .
How we manage economic and social development in the new Europe , how we harness the real potential offered by enlargement , how we breathe life into those words - these are , therefore , vital questions that Ireland will seek to address during our presidency .
We must take precautions now , not just on behalf of those of us who are concerned , but on behalf of the complacent minority of Member States as well .
I want to focus in particular , though , on agriculture , which has several problems , but I think we need to remember that agriculture is about food production and we need to take that into account in what we are asking this sector to do .
That would be a recipe for communal strife in the future .
But where is the scientific evidence about the medium- and long @-@ term term effects of GM crops upon biodiversity ?
On the issue of n@@ ony@@ l@@ phen@@ ol , this is an aqu@@ atic pollu@@ tant , and although many in the committee tried to talk about health risks and bring in other factors , we must concentrate on the case at hand , which is making sure that n@@ ony@@ l@@ phen@@ ol does not reach water courses and is banned in applications where there is no alternative .
We have an obligation to be serious about our contribution to the future development of the Union and our ambitions for a better way forward have got to meet the expectations of all the citizens of the European Union .
First , we need to re @-@ establish establish stability by consolidating public finances .
Therefore it is your historic challenge and chance , Prime M@@ inst@@ er , to take the lead also in promoting integration of different historic experiences , to create a united and balanced perception of our history as a common European history .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Mr President , we are here today to prevent a potential , large @-@ scale scale , human tragedy from taking place .
I wish you a very warm welcome !
We are actively engaged in the aid @-@ for for @-@ trade trade debate taking place in the WTO .
It is much better to strive towards the EU accession of Turkey , keep the accession process alive and move towards the shared objective , because that is the way for Turkey to become a more European , more democratic country , where the rule of law and fundamental freedoms are respected .
. - I share your view that it is quite clearly necessary to develop an asylum system that prevents those in need of international protection from being victimis@@ ed by criminal gangs .
The EU is engaged in human rights dialogues with both countries , with the primary aim of achieving concrete progress on the ground .
There can never be a true European Union when we have such high levels of unemployment .
This is , of course , a complex issue , and we have to take into account all those sensitive matters which are related to simplification , but the fact is that certain provisions in the Regulations are really outdated and need to be re@@ considered and revised .
That legal locu@@ s lies with the Member State and I would suggest that , rather than re@@ hear@@ se the arguments that we first had the opportunity to discuss in this Parliament earlier this month , he should express his concern directly to those governments which have it within their powers to take action on the matter .
Let us understand and fully bring into being the Europe of diversity in this reunited form .
It is very difficult to believe that such slavery still exists in this day and age , yet we read that trafficking in women is actually on the increase according to the International Organization for Migration .
It highlights the whole question of safety within the European Union ; it is an area we should all be concerned about and , as such , I would hope that the Commission and Council will accept it .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals are to strengthen and update existing rules which , as has been mentioned tonight , have been in force for almost 25 years .
Fun@@ n@@ ily enough , the Commission claims it wants to encourage research , development and entrepreneurship , in order to restore growth to the European economy .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , thank you , Marco , for a very good report , but sadly I have to agree with other people in this House that you stra@@ yed beyond the remit - and I know why .
More importantly , the implementation of an effective traceability programme from producer to consumer is crucial to the overall success of our campaign to restore consumer confidence .
This motion for a resolution has a number of concrete steps that we ourselves can take to alleviate the situation in that troubled part of the world .
This whole approach is a significant element of the pre @-@ accession accession strategy since participation in such programmes contributes to the implementation of the economic and cultural cooperation provisions of the Europe Agreement .
So the European Union has to envisage action right across the whole range of instruments at its disposal , both military and non @-@ military military .
I know that they are thinking about the best way forward .
We want to have a broad debate on our relationship where all significant issues will be addressed , from trade to investment - which is bo@@ om@@ ing - and energy , democracy , and also human rights .
As a collection of 15 Member States we approach the issue of public access to documents differently , but I am glad to see that , largely , the European Parliament stands as a bul@@ wark against the forces which seek to keep the doors of the institutions closed to the public .
I would just ask the Commission - as my colleague K@@ ad@@ er Arif has already done - to be very careful in evaluating each individual case .
I repeat to the honourable Member my personal concern about this issue and my determination that we should raise it whenever we need to with the Russian authorities .
In its Agenda 2000 - and I am happy to refer to that because I was a member of the Steering Group for Agenda 2000 , which was adopted in 1997 - the Commission examined the impact of the accession of central and eastern European countries from two angles : its impact on EU policies such as agriculture or regional policy , and its budgetary consequences .
From the perspective of my group , I would like to underline that that is the crucial test that the Commission has to live up to and we need to contribute to because , if so , we can all contribute to Europe with more and better innovations .
in writing . - The Union needs to maximise its efforts to implement a consistent framework to tackle the global financial crisis .
On the one hand , we have to consider targeted measures against the Belarusian authorities and , I believe , to conduct a review of sanctions .
It is crucial too , despite the pain of recession , to confront the challenge of climate change and the problems posed by poverty .
In the name of democracy , let them carry out those promises !
We are talking about freedom , security and justice : three fundamental principles .
This report is appalling in what it exposes as regards the conduct of this Parliament .
The intention may be good , but we do not need this good intention .
This action plan is a guide for very concrete measures to be taken during the next five years .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Madam President , it is a great privilege and honour for me to return to the European Parliament in my new capacity as the representative of the Hungarian rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
It should deal with , for example , a properly integrated European Union grid .
We believe that should be our guiding principle .
Third , as was the case on previous occasions when European Treaties ran into difficulties at national level , additional elements could be introduced to address concerns that have arisen .
I hope I am not shocking anyone by saying that it is not as easy as that .
For the longer term , the Financial Regulation provides for a review every three years , or whenever necessary .
In our view , this is impractical and u@@ no@@ b@@ tainable .
It therefore intends to actively participate in these discussions and carefully evaluate developments .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s purpose was to simplify the committee system .
Sub@@ stanti@@ al counterfeiting will eng@@ ender the severe risk of global damage to the whole credibility of , and confidence in , the euro .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the rapporteur is right to refer to the democratic deficit .
This approach remains crucial today as we face one of the worst economic crises in recent times and also has its part to play in this week &amp; apos ; s summit .
In relation to the proposal on food additives , the regulation of such substances is important to ensure the safety of food and also to ensure that the consumer is not misled .
Fis@@ cal discipline , economic governance and the rescue of the euro will be incomplete without a mutually agreed plan at European level to stimulate growth .
Do we really want no@@ vices piloting the biggest contain@@ er ships in the world up narrow ti@@ dal waterways and trying to ber@@ th them safely ?
- Madam President , to save time the Socialists are prepared to accept Amendments 8 and 10 as additions , but we will vote against if they are not accepted as additions by the PPE @-@ DE DE Group .
in writing . - I voted for this report as Europe &amp; apos ; s 10 @-@ 12 12 million Roma should benefit from binding minimum standards at EU level to improve their access to employment , education , housing and healthcare .
I think we need a little bit more of that conversation in this Parliament , in Council and in the Commission .
Of course the Ecolabel should be given to the most environmentally friendly products , and the information should be clear and correct .
There are common policies to encourage our development .
That is why we have the principle of subsidiarity , which states that we should not act at European level if national or local action is perfectly adequate .
That is why the Commission has been extremely prudent in the way it communi@@ cates on that matter because some of these issues are market sensitive .
The real problem , as is pointed out in the report , is that there is fragmentation and uneven transposition of European law .
I hope all the Member States will be ready to support this view .
I therefore abstained on the resolution .
I also welcome the greater role that is given to the European Parliament , being the only directly elected body at EU level and which has an even greater role now after the Lisbon Treaty - although not everybody seems to have realised that yet .
We have urged all parties involved to resolve their differences peacefully in full respect of the country &amp; apos ; s legal framework and to promptly engage in a dialogue in the interests of peace and stability in the country .
What we will need is an assessment of the impact of measures taken .
Mr President , I wish to begin by welcoming and thanking Mr de Mi@@ gu@@ el , State Secretary for European Affairs of the Spanish presidency .
Minister , you spoke to us after everything seems to have been decided on Georgia .
Since this will require negotiations , I do not wish to specul@@ ate at this point on the detail .
It must be a wide @-@ ranging ranging and broad @-@ based based debate .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and of course its rapporteur , Mr P@@ es@@ ä@@ l@@ ä , for the very positive approach adopted towards the Commission proposal ; and the Commission appreciates the broad acceptance of its proposal .
We must speak with one voice . We must , in the short term , demand the immediate lifting of Israel &amp; quot ; s air and sea blockade of Lebanon .
However , we are not convinced that one form of discrimination should be coun@@ tered with another form of discrimination , namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee women elected places .
This is due , at least in part , to the comprehensive vocational education and training systems in those Member States , which facilitate young people &amp; apos ; s labour market integration .
The Commission looks forward to the Finnish Presidency taking forward the negotiations on the next generation of Northern Dimension partnerships .
It is time for us not simply not to upgrade that agreement , but to suspend that agreement .
But I believe this time we have a report which , though it might not be what all of us would have wished in every respect , nevertheless commands very wide support .
The EU hopes that both sides will continue to engage fully in this process , for instance through consolidation of the Line of Control ceasefire .
I shall just deal very briefly with two other points concerning the whole working time directive .
We have taken note of the significant progress that has been made .
Madam President , at the outset I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Pérez Roy@@ o , for his report on the proposal for a Council directive on the taxation of savings income .
I hope that Parliament will continue to be vigilant about civil , political and social rights in Egypt but will also continue to work hard for a stronger relationship between the European Union and the people in government in Egypt .
At the same time it is essential that all citizens be guaranteed the same benefits from the upgrading of telecommunications infrastructures .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s Civil Protection Mechanism is also coordinating the European Union &amp; apos ; s response to Japan &amp; apos ; s request for assistance .
Other measures include those designed to improve the safety of ships other than oil tankers , such as passenger vessels , to ensure a minimum level of seafarers &amp; apos ; training and to reduce pollution from ships .
A month ago Parliament &amp; apos ; s Baltic Europe Intergroup passed a resolution on the EU @-@ Russia Russia Summit , a matter of great importance to this House .
The reporting requirements for Member States and the Commission in Article 14 have been strengthened and these , together with the measurement system , will make Member States &amp; quot ; achievements quantifiable and visible .
Mr President , I am concerned about a number of aspects in the Langen report .
On the other hand she mentioned that in the interests of the local bodies , the Commission would be asking for changes .
This initiative will ensure that the Institutions continue to work on the issues closest to their citizens &amp; apos ; hearts , while encouraging cross @-@ border border debate on European issues .
It ensures there will be proper respect and trust for the Member States and for their roles within it , in particular for the smaller Member States ; it clearly sets down in the doctrine of confer@@ ral who has the power to do what and where the lines of demar@@ cation are drawn .
Can we not see that to diminish the rights of another is ultimately to diminish our own ?
In particular , we will focus on the essential issue of support to the electoral process .
What is even more important is the transport sector .
We call in particular for advance guidance on the transposition of directives and for the provision of implementation guidelines where regulations are concerned .
Ar@@ gu@@ ably , that is what we should focus on more and more .
It does not seem to us to be the right place for it .
To this end , the Commission has adopted several communications including a progress report on e @-@ Europe Europe last week and a paper setting out an agenda for economic and social renewal for Europe two weeks ago .
They are two different situations .
We in the European Union have been moving more and more towards closer cooperation and coordination , as Mrs Palacio has already stated , in areas such as the single market and environment .
If you think about it , the big difference at the moment between European and national elections is that , when we vote in national elections , we go out to vote for or against a government , not for a parliament in isolation .
The Commission is also right in its report , Agenda 2000 , to point out that some countries are further down the road to accession than others .
This is probably one of the greatest challenges for all the institutions and I welcome the &amp; apos ; raising the game &amp; apos ; proposals put forward by Parliament &amp; apos ; s Secretary @-@ General General to improve the focus of our secretariat &amp; apos ; s activities and give greater legislative assistance to Members .
We will continue to push for an ambitious result .
Finally , in view of the fact that we have not met the political target of halting the loss of biodiversity in 2010 , we will have to assess the reasons why we have failed .
This report , which was a response from the European Parliament to the G20 , is the right balance .
It is therefore not by chance that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to be the setting for this new step forward by the European Union .
It regrets nevertheless that its amendment on the issue of the sett@@ lers has not been adopted by the House .
I would like you to know that we will do our best to make it work .
We are pooling resources at European level , allowing Member States to cut their costs , avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment .
In Poland , for instance , the dialogue with civil society and , especially , with NGOs has been pushed forward thanks to the cohesion policy requirements .
Mr Guellec &amp; apos ; s report highlights the fact that , while there is economic convergence occurring between Member States , there is also a widening of regional and local disparities .
We have called for tougher measures to be introduced by the Council and for the other countries of Southern Africa , in particular the Republic of South Africa , to play a stronger role in bringing about change for the better in Zimbabwe .
With the situation in flux and neither Hamas nor the Israelis talking to one another , we must set achievable terms on which we can talk to both .
Subject : Energy cooperation in south @-@ east east Europe
The first cooperation Council has already been scheduled for July , and it is the Council &amp; apos ; s intention to continue the exchanges of view on the democratisation process and to incorporate these into the political dialogue foreseen in the PCA .
Thir@@ ty years later , some might say that it is still struggling .
We must secure fundamental change by ensuring that the establishment of the independent Human Rights Commission trans@@ lates into tangible change on the ground , and that the new Constitution enshrines human rights for all , including women .
Here we are in a terrible dilemma .
Will upheaval in a secular Arab state advance the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine ?
We will of course return to this in second reading .
. Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report , coming , I would remind other Members , from the committee and not simply from one individual .
Thirdly , we need to be very clear to whoever is watching the euro area that we will never be defeated .
Firstly I call for a charter of principles : principles for a service of economic interests to be drawn up by the Commission ; secondly , I require and ask for democratic scrutiny for the Commission activity in that field to be developed in Parliament in the form of an observatory .
It is imperative that the guidelines highlight the need for consultation with those involved at local level in the preparation of the national guidelines and also in the subsequent preparation of rural development programmes .
It is good to hear , therefore , that the Commission shares our concern and that it is pushing for cooperation between Member States and again looking at cross @-@ border border cases and trying to inform citizens and companies .
Mr President , this report is , in my group &amp; apos ; s view , of the utmost importance in the development of the democratic legitimacy and the credibility of this House .
I would like the Commission , perhaps , in their further studies and the Council to consider these in the future .
What a pity it is that the Council and the Commission do not focus their efforts on putting the European Union house in order before enlargement instead of grandiose political schemes .
The Commission agrees with the thrust of this resolution , which contains many important elements , such as support for the Monterrey Consensus and the emphasis on the need for increased policy coherence in developed countries .
In fact , achieving the Barcelona target of raising the labour market withdrawal age by five years would almost solve our financing problems as identified in the public pension expenditure projections by the Economic Policy Committee .
We also agree on how best to achieve that : through concrete , sensible , targeted changes based on close contact with the market and informed by a strong commitment to making markets work for the end investor .
In this report , I suggested some of the principles which should underlie the reformed common agricultural policy . It is clear that the agricultural industry needs to change .
I would highlight our acceptance of Amendments Nos 7 and 21 , definitions of direct and indirect discrimination , harassment and sexual harassment and Amendment No 39 in part , scope of powers of independent bodies .
I hope our fellow Members will recognise that .
The President cut the speaker off
How will we do that ?
There is a lot of hypocrisy here .
. Mr President , it has been said various times that this is certainly one of the most difficult challenges we have at this moment in foreign policy .
This is a very important aim but it is important that all elements of the Water Framework Directive are workable and realistic .
In addition to national programmes , the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .
We should pursue that balance between flexibility and security .
However , I fully agree with the elements in the resolution - and I am sure this will be followed up in a number of speeches today - which recalled the importance Belarus has , not only for the European Union , but also for the stability and prosperity of the whole region .
It falls within the competence of the national customs authorities to determine , for each and every individual consign@@ ment , whether , under those provisions , the elements of fact and law allow refusal of the preferential tariff treatment .
But , having said that , does the Commission have any plans to introduce any of those reforms which may not need the Lisbon Treaty to be enforced - for example , on improving the capacity to implement EU law on the Staff Regulations ?
It is time to look at the facts .
Mr President , I thank Mr Atkins for his report and also for his willingness to cooperate and work with not only my group but other groups in coming up with this document .
You would find a disproportionate number from certain countries of the world with direct or historical ties to Europe .
It was hard to get everyone to more or less agree , and this was the best solution that we could find . It is not absolutely perfect but it gathered maximum support in this Chamber .
We support in particular the aim of ambitious medium and long @-@ term term emission reduction targets , the promotion of renewable energy and increased energy efficiency , and the call for a sustainable approach to forestry , rain@@ forests and deforestation .
Member States can be criticised but not punished , because ratification is still a national competence .
As the honourable Member knows , the primary objective of EC competition policy is to make markets work better for the benefit of consumers in the EU .
All EU legislation and its implementation at Member State level will now have to be checked against the Charter and can be challenged if it falls short .
Madam President , I wish to congratulate Parliament and , in particular , its Conciliation Committee and the rapporteur , Mr Miller , on their success in reaching an agreement with the Council on this very important directive .
In addition , delegations in countries where migration has emerged as an important new topic in the context of Community external assistance are also assisted by the departments in Brussels through training measures , thematic networks at operational level and support missions .
Your backing is crucial to maintain widespread visibility for the strategy to maintain high @-@ level level political support for the strategy and to maintain pressure on the Member States and the regional actors to deliver results .
Mr President , I really have nothing further to add to my previous two replies which I hope make the position clear .
This proposed Protocol should be seen as a necessary measure in a European strategy for police cooperation in the field of money laundering .
For these reasons I voted against the legislative resolution .
Certainly anything that promotes labour flexibility , liber@@ ates enterprise and reduces burdens on business must be good for the economies of those countries and for employment .
I welcome this report which promotes a research fund to develop elements of these industries inside the EU , as we need answers to our future energy needs .
It is sometimes forgotten that although the main justification for research is to become more competitive at international level , even in the current Treaty we are told that we must promote all the research activities deemed necessary by the other chapters .
You will appreciate that I cannot promise to take on board all your views , but my record before this Parliament will demonstrate that I will do my utmost .
Mr President , very briefly , this is a very sorry story .
Mr President , the Commission participates fully in the European Union &amp; apos ; s endeavours to support human rights in Syria .
That is why I want to give you all the assurance that we will present to you a new mandate on the basis of the new Treaty of Lisbon , precisely for addressing this issue , where the European Parliament will have its full powers .
This is done from time to time .
In conclusion , many thanks are due to everyone who has worked so hard to produce this directive , and especially to my colleague Mr Maaten - although he is not a sw@@ im@@ mer he has still worked extremely hard - to the Commission and , of course , to the members of the Conciliation Committee .
The 40 strategic initiatives which the Commission commits to present in 2011 reflect the main political priorities that we have identified together .
One of our main objectives will be to bring on board the United States and other fast @-@ developing developing countries like China and India in a common but differentiated way , as provided for by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change .
Could I just start with some facts .
The next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A5 @-@ 02@@ 21 02@@ 21 / 2003 ) by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to air passengers in the event of denied boar@@ ding and of cancellation or long delay of flights ( 15@@ 8@@ 55 / 1 / 2002 - C5 @-@ 01@@ 36 01@@ 36 / 2003 - 2001 / 0305 ( COD ) ) ( Rapporteur : Gi@@ orgi@@ o Lisi ) .
European leaders have to speak out and advocate what we are doing and be able to defend it .
Human rights remains an important part of the EU &amp; apos ; s relationship with these countries .
Secondly , priority has to be given to three strategies :
On that account I did not vote for it .
We will continue to insist that Russia must abide by its international commitments and respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and other eastern European countries that make up its common neighbourhood with the EU .
The position we have to take regarding the territorial integrity of Indonesia is simple : we have to abide by international law and by the United Nations Resolution 2@@ 50@@ 4 of December 19@@ 69 .
This is a crucial element .
One of the most important issues in the discussion that we had last year here in Parliament , when I presented the Annual Report for 1999 , concerned the situation in the Member States .
I want to clarify this .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am impressed by the intrigu@@ ing questions of the honourable Members , especially the fact that nearly every one is critically constructive .
I understand the arguments but you must be aware that positions are divided in the Council .
In other words , the crisis should be seen as an incentive to implement the Lisbon strategy .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this important resolution as we have to condemn in the strongest terms the recent attacks on Christian communities around the world - be it in Egypt , Pakistan , Iraq or any other country .
Many of my colleagues have mentioned that it was very important that Parliament was able to raise some concerns and make improvements to the process .
The Bonn Declaration was most welcome in that it committed the European Union and the United States of America to a full and equal partnership , and of course the EU and the US are both partners and competitors , particularly in trade matters .
On Amendments Nos 58 and 59 on Members &amp; apos ; assistants , this House knows the Commission has been and always will be very aware and sympathetic to the concerns about this issue in Parliament .
We have to overcome certain short @-@ term term issues to be able to focus on long @-@ term term economic and social development .
There is little point in my going over all the various points raised individually and debating them , because they have been debated ad nau@@ se@@ am in the committee .
Would he agree that if the European Union is to connect better with its citizens , then the public sources of information need to reflect the principles of openness and transparency ?
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report as it contains many good ideas on how to progress our tourism policy .
Because a crucial element in this quick transposition is that the European Union will be able to accede to the World Intel@@ lectual Prop@@ er@@ ty Organisation Treaty and that will bring a very important measure of global protection to all the artists involved .
Europe will work with the world community to fight the spread of weapons of mass destruction and to promote disarmament .
I would end by saying that I regret the absence of the Council in this debate since , as Commissioner Patten has pointed out , the Commission does not have jurisdiction , and the failure of the Council to adopt a common position and a strategy to implement the upholding of the rule of law in Guantanamo Bay is a sad omission .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I want to thank the European Parliament for its quick handling of this proposal , in the light of the request by the European Council of last December in the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan to settle the issue of reduced VAT rates in certain sectors by March 2009 .
Parliament &amp; quot ; s resolution will help the Commission continue its work on the negotiating process in cooperation with Parliament .
Those short @-@ term term measures require immediate action .
