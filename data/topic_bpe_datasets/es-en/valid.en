It is therefore highly important that we retain the paragraph of the Resolution regarding a code of conduct for the oil companies , as we cannot allow them to act without one .
Commissioner , on Thursday , this Parliament will vote on a resolution which will establish its position at the end of the debate .
Firstly , what action must we take in the &amp; apos ; pre @-@ in in &amp; apos ; countries or in third countries ?
Israel &amp; apos ; s right to combat terrorism cannot restrict the operational capacity of President Arafat as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and of the Palestinian National Authority .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s objective is therefore to ensure that all aircraft flying to European destin@@ ations are always insu@@ red against various risks , including war and terrorism .
In an increasingly global and interdependent world , until now our policy has been to establish international law , above all through the United Nations , but also through other world organisations , and we have therefore drawn up a regulatory framework for international relations , because we are convinced that that is the best way to prevent and deal with any possible conflicts .
Mr President , thank you to all of the Members for their contributions .
We must simplify and give responsibility to the Member States and then they must come here to face up to the consequences .
I believe that it is important for us to consider and place this debate within its most appropriate context , Mr President .
Madam President , Mrs Ashton , first of all , allow me to congratulate Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez @-@ Neyra Neyra on the very successful outcome of his report .
I believe that this is a good start .
First example : the Commission has proposed a directive for the reuni@@ ting of legal immigrants with their families in the Member States of the Union .
Mr President , I congratulate and support Carlos Coelho , and I would like to point out that this report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
It has been said here that the priority objective is dealing with inflation , but it is not the only one : we have to think in terms of , amongst other things , an economic focus , responsibility , the international representation of the euro and the monitoring of the banking institutions at a time of significant mergers amongst the financial institutions .
Today , at the end of his mandate , I am delighted to note , as the Commissioner responsible for relations with the European Parliament , that the results are very positive .
Commissioner , it is not a question of failing to defend the recovery of stocks , but of defending the fishermen and their families .
Secondly , in the transport sector we are working on it , and I hope that in the near future we will be able to make it a reality .
The Group of the Europe Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party obviously supports the Commission &amp; apos ; s actions in favour of a Mediterranean policy , as outlined five years ago in Barcelona , and we want it to be consolidated .
It is important to highlight the fact that the action plan will help us to coordinate Community initiatives and those of the Member States .
The Member States act as they wish and improvis@@ e .
We believe that child@@ hood and youth must be protected and that children and young people must be brought up by their families and society as a whole .
We in the Committee on Fisheries are going to closely monitor the objectives and proposals in this report , aimed at dealing with the serious problem of illegal fishing .
Therefore , since we all want Chernobyl to be shut down , the Ukra@@ ini@@ an Parliament has said that if the K@@ h@@ mel@@ nit@@ sky 2 group and R@@ ov@@ no 4 are not completed - and soon , I should imagine - they will start up another of the inactive Chernobyl units .
I would like to encourage the Commission , in the way that the Commissioner has described , to seek to make al@@ liances , promote programmes , motivate donor countries and work towards ensuring that developing countries have access to generic drugs at prices which their citizens can afford .
Unfortunately , we may have to discuss it again , but I think that the European Union should have a fundamental role - as Man@@ olo Medina was saying - in Latin America in general .
I am therefore of the opinion - - and this is an opinion - - that the report must call - - perhaps the Commission could en@@ lighten us in this regard - - for the definitive ratification of the A@@ I@@ P@@ C@@ D by the European Union , and not its accession to this Convention .
The proposal will equip us with more and more efficient means with which to combat tax fraud and tax evasion in Europe .
The applause that rounded it off clearly demonstrates that when there is a specific political objective , this Parliament can be reli@@ ed upon to support it .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , please allow me firstly to pay tribute to a person connected to the world of transport , the head of local police recently murdered by the terrorist group ETA .
Secondly , we must also act jointly .
Mr President , today we are debating a report which goes much further than the figures on alleged fraud or errors in the Community accounts . It demands that the Members of this Parliament act responsibly .
We already knew all of this , Commissioner , but we expect you to adopt a position more in keeping with your post and with the Commission &amp; apos ; s responsibilities regarding such an important manifestation of European culture for which it is responsible .
I hope that is the case and of course I will remind all the ministers of this at the next Council .
In this respect , we have tried to make progress with the gradual unification of our visa systems .
In our report we also refer to goods and services , and your Resolution also stresses the importance of integrated networks of transport and services infrastructures , as well as the need for rigorous competition policy and proposes that consumers be offered the possibility of choosing between different networks of services .
My speech will focus on three points .
I want to congratulate the rapporteur for being so understanding during discussions on this subject , because I think the 20 or so amendments which have finally been adopted are reasonable and balanced .
In one particular area some progress has already been made , as at the Luxembourg Summit of November 1997 on unemployment , the Commission managed to obtain a commitment from the Member States to provisionally apply the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam relating to employment , which means that certain aspects of the Treaty are already in force .
I would finally like to stress this report &amp; apos ; s aim of contributing to the constitutional process under way so that we might clarify this issue of the European Prosecutor , which is enormously important for the future of the Union .
Unfortunately , the European Union does not have homogenous criteria . There is no harmonised asylum policy .
We therefore believe that , based on this consideration , we should commit to a transitional security system that will enable the gradual de@@ militarisation of all security in the world . We obviously do not agree with the Union being linked to NATO , among other things , because NATO &amp; apos ; s strategy has been to choose to give a military response to in@@ securities such as organised crime and terrorism , which have never been matters for a military response .
This fact reveals the lack of coordination between the various Community policies , and demonstrates the need for a global approach to ensure that they are consistent with the objective of economic and social cohesion .
Therefore , in the Communication that we adopted this morning , the Commission not only wishes to take stock of the past , but we also propose starting a debate on what needs to be improved for the future .
The report deals with an institutional problem that , to my mind , is essential in defining the future architecture of Europe and , more specifically , that of a Union that hopes to become the instrument that peacefully unites the continent .
I believe that this message provides an appropriate conclusion to my speech .
Having made these observations , I would like to reiterate our support for this initiative .
Before anybody proposes the restoration of torture in the investi@@ ga@@ tive processes , I would ask , please , that the defence of the accused be attended to .
It specifically says : &amp; quot ; Whe@@ reas , one year before that date the Commission will monitor the market situation and app@@ raise whether European yards are affected by anti @-@ competitive competitive practices .
However , such delegation of powers must be facilitated by giving the legislator the institutional means to scrutinise the exercise of such powers .
Mr President , firstly , I would like to associate myself with my group &amp; apos ; s concern at this proliferation of partial and fragmented measures , which are sometimes incompatible with the Treaties and almost always incompatible with the Community approach , and about which we are uncertain as to whether they come from the Member States or from the Council .
In any case , something has to be done and the Council should express an opinion .
On this point I disagree with some colleagues who believe it would be better to establish a comparison with high @-@ ranking ranking civil servants .
Finally , the Commission completely accepts all those amendments aimed at improving the Regulation from a gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical point of view , while maintaining its content .
I therefore maintain the position of the Committee on Fisheries of asking for the exemption to be suspended in the review of the agreement that we are discussing .
I trust the House will agree to these amendments .
I therefore cannot accept Amendment No 35 .
With regard to risk assessment , it should be of a scientific and independent nature .
Unless the energy dimension , and those of development and the environment are addressed appropriately at the same time we will really make very little progress .
But it is fair to say that , although expenditure is being reduced , the principle of concentration was left intact . By allocating more than two thirds of the Structural Funds to Objective 1 regions , work on cohesion will remain at levels that are the same as or higher than those of the previous programming period .
Finally , I ask the Commission to defend the interests of European producers in all trade negotiations , in order not to endanger the production of the livestock sector .
The conviction that , by not dealing vigorously with the issue of education in the developing countries , we will not only fail to eradicate poverty , but that the gap between the rich and poor countries will increase , has certainly led us to place education at the centre of the global strategy for eradicating poverty .
Turkey is vital in that Process just as we are vital for Turkey in the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean Process too .
There are two key elements that we need in order to do this : energy interconnections , as the expectations set out in 2002 have not been met , and a common regulatory framework to consolidate an energy common market .
We agree that fostering personnel mobility between research centres and companies , promoting private sector investment in R &amp; amp ; D , and ensuring that universities provide the job market with well prepared personnel , are all essential actions .
In this respect , I believe that we have to be clear : it is not only a request of the European Parliament at this point .
The moderates must speak up , as Mr Patten rightly said .
Bi@@ lingu@@ alism is cultural rich@@ ness , but it is also an interesting aspect of tolerance and mutual respect .
Madam President , we in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy have held intense debates over recent months , with the imminent negotiation of the Seventh Framework Programme and other important initiatives in mind . Our debates have allowed us to clarify our needs and objectives in relation to science , technology and innovation .
By the Council &amp; apos ; s offer of negotiations now , if a start is made on reforms to guarantee respect for human rights and to begin the transition to democracy , the European Union is opening doors to hope , for which the Cuban people will certainly be grateful .
This concern has also been met .
In the first place , we believe that we need to maintain the European perspective for Turkey .
However , what has not been positive is the way that the Council has presented these plans to Parliament , which has remained silent on the way in which they have been selected and drafted .
Mr Morillon did not take this into account when tabling his amendment and I think it is important .
These are areas in which we should have more influence in the future .
I am yet to receive any reply in this regard .
As I have said many times before , the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika .
Mr President , the European Union obviously condemns political violence in all its forms .
It is a major step in the right direction , because it is showing us which way to go , but it is not sufficient .
I therefore suggest we follow the examples of Germany and the previous Belgian Presidency , in which we have seen the participation of representatives of all their regions and communities .
There is no need to remind you of the long discussions in Council , which ended with a common position on a compromise accepted by all the States , all the delegations present , and which , of course , I myself accept on behalf of the Commission .
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically .
So our conclusion is that excluding self @-@ employed employed workers is going to have horrendous effects for these workers and also for the sector .
Secondly , in its final observation 8.@@ 1 , the committee highlights that the Commission must be provided with the resources necessary for its responsibilities and stipulates that it is not only referring to those laid down in the Regulations .
We will have to return to this issue .
In this sector , secure and sustainable as we know it and want it to be , it is essential that we proceed in a secure and sustainable manner .
Mr President , as representative of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , I would firstly like to thank and congratulate Mr Klich on his wonderful report .
Therefore , since the qualified majority will be extended , there will also be more codecision with Parliament .
Once again it is also necessary to insist that there can be no military solution to this conflict and that peace and security can only be achieved through negotiation .
Therefore , Mr President , we hope that a referendum will be held soon and that its results will be accepted by all .
I therefore believe that it should not be co @-@ funded funded and we have presented an amendment which I hope this House will support tomorrow .
Mr President , we approved the Lisbon Agenda with its very ambitious objectives in 2000 .
Mr President , the European Parliament must remain a place of negotiation and compromise .
The first is the need for Member States to remain rigorous and resolute with regard to the commitments established in the respective stability programmes : we are worried that there may be flexibility - in the field of deficit and public debt - with regard to those issues intended to ensure that objectives are achieved and complied with .
In this respect , I welcome Commissioner Barnier &amp; apos ; s efforts to put things in order .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit Bendit and Mr Morillon because the working approach proposed in this report reflects the approach drawn up in the resolution on the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean Ministerial Conference in Valencia .
I must point out , ladies and gentlemen , that the reality of the internal civil aviation market in Europe has been affected in a very negative way by this .
We believe that Parliament , the Commission and the Council must have a joint and global solution based on dual legitimacy , which is able to ensure a balance .
Legislative action and proposals may be brought into play , but it is not in itself a legislative programme .
I would like to end by thanking you all once again for your cooperation and the useful ideas you have offered us , which we will take into account as far as possible .
It goes without saying that any other interpretation merits respect . However , as the Presidency has to decide , it has so decided .
It is a directive that gives context to employers &amp; apos ; obligations and , certainly , the sanctions that must be imposed on employers who exploit workers without rights for their own benefit .
These hard working conditions mean , for example , that young people do not want to join the industry , which prevents the new generation from taking over .
Firstly , I would like to say that I entirely agree with what the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council said : there is clear progress , with more than 20 national action plans established worldwide , as well as the appointment of the first United Nations Special Representative for violence against women in armed conflicts .
I am thinking about issues such as our increasing foreign dependence and the problem of climate change .
I can only reply be repeating my previous answer on this issue .
Mr President , it is widely acknowledged that international terrorism has brought new challenges to our societies .
Nevertheless , the reasons behind terrorism , or rather the reasons that lead certain people to become terrorists , lie well beyond this .
The Union &amp; apos ; s budget must reflect this confidence and contribute to strengthening the policies of the States aimed at full employment , solidarity and economic growth .
The protection of computer @-@ implemented implemented inventions by means of patents is not a new problem and it must be made clear , as other Members have said in this House , that there is no intention to establish rules allowing computer programs to be paten@@ ted , but to extend the classic doctrine of patents to computer @-@ implemented implemented inventions .
We always focus on health , housing and employment , but this is a fundamental problem and resolving it should be a priority .
I would like to make an additional comment on two points .
I would like to stress and express my gratitude for the cooperation of the various rapporteurs - Mrs Rothe , Mr K@@ ron@@ ber@@ ger and Mr Clegg - which has been excellent .
At present , there are only two areas on which the rapporteur and my group disagree .
We can neither carry on with a Commission in total ruin , nor delay its investiture until next year .
I also believe that the forces of reason and of political intelligence in Israel should mobilise themselves in order to convince their co @-@ citizens citizens that the longer the occupation and repression la@@ sts , the more radical the Palestinians will be .
One of them said - actually it was the end of one paragraph - that &amp; apos ; economic , social and cultural rights are essential to the exercise of civil and political rights &amp; apos ; .
For some time , I have been trying to ensure that the Commission deals appropriately with European forests , and I have seen the problems that have arisen as a result of the need to deal in a variety of ways with this issue which has a clear environmental dimension .
Therefore , the Commission practically accepts all of the amendments and with regard to Amendment Nos 7 and 8 , it cannot accept them as they stand , but it accepts the spirit of their content .
I repeat : diversi@@ fied .
Mr President , I would like to thank both yourself and also Mr Bolkestein for his kindness and his cooperation .
I would like to express my respect for all their positions .
The Commission is committed to carrying out this control and it should be done , obviously , in accordance with the evolution of macro @-@ economic economic factors .
However , perhaps I could remind the honourable Members of the position we adopted following the approval of the Statute last June .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mrs Estrela on her report and add something to what has been said so far , most of which I agree with .
I am grateful to the Commissioner for her answer but I would like to ask a couple of specific questions .
I am confident that such acts will be increasingly difficult to carry out as a result of the measures that we have adopted over recent months .
Although the composition of this flow of migrants is undoubtedly varied , we do not believe that this is a valid excuse for failing to make the necessary distinc@@ tions .
We must be cautious , but at the same time have faith in the democratic values that we have been fostering in Spain since democracy returned .
I think this is an important matter .
Is now the moment to talk about the point Mr Poettering has raised , or will he submit it later ?
The committee &amp; apos ; s work was long and arduous , but it bor@@ e fruit .
In any event , in the 2001 update of the stability programme , which is due to be presented by the end of the year , the Greek authorities will undertake the necessary adjustment of their medium @-@ term term macroeconomic outlook and an assessment of the impact of this on public finances .
This is an extremely sensitive issue for most of the Union &amp; apos ; s citizens .
This attitude of equanimity and coherence will also guide the European Union &amp; apos ; s actions with regard to the treatment of Chechnya at the 5@@ 8@@ th sitting of the Human@@ s Rights Commission .
I believe that it sets out clearly the difficulties of the P@@ h@@ are programme , as well as laying down a number of guidelines for the future .
Then there is the matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
It is a constitutional question insofar as it is an interinstitutional agreement .
Mr President , first I want to thank Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten Ruijten for her excellent report , in which she once again defends before this House the rights of migrant workers , including frontier workers .
In any case , this report talks of freedom , religious freedom , freedom of thought and even freedom to reject a social model , but makes it clear that Europe cannot accept inci@@ te@@ ment to violence , inci@@ te@@ ment to hatred or the destruction of the very pillars of society under the clo@@ ak of religion .
We consider that an increase of at least 5 % is needed over the total expenditure in the current financial perspective .
Although I was not able to vote , my vote is against .
For Europe it is very beneficial .
We also have many mutual interests in terms of energy security , one of the greatest challenges of our times .
Since then , 22 September , the situation on the ground in Gaza has unfortunately deteriorated .
I must tell you , ladies and gentlemen , that I hope , given the degree of adjustment and development , that we are now on the finishing touches .
And of course we must not forget human rights .
Parliament considers the Ombudsman to be a trou@@ b@@ les@@ ome institution at times , but one that is always of great importance to our legal system .
The European Union is doing its duty , because it is controlling zoonosis from the start of the production chain , and because it applies the principle that &amp; apos ; prevention is better than cure &amp; apos ; , which it is following rigorously , at a very high cost to producers and to the industry in the European Union .
The question now asked is identical .
This European Council noted with great satisfaction the commitment given by the future Members of the European Union to the Lisbon reform strategy .
However , I must stress that the Commission believes that we must reach a compromise , a pragmatic solution in order to prevent a conciliation procedure and a delay .
Hence my protest .
Let us remember , for example , the prohibi@@ tions imposed by the region of T@@ y@@ rol at the moment and the procedures the Commission has initiated in that regard .
However , before drawing firm policy conclusions on the quality of public spending , there is a need for complementary analysis that takes into account the specific aims of spending programmes , their design and lin@@ k@@ ages with other economic policy instruments . This is what we will be setting out to do for the coming years .
Mr President , all of us here want to do everything possible to bring about a viable peace process , and we are fully aware that if we do not act correctly , we run the risk of the world being driven towards a period of ho@@ ly wars , religious wars , brought on by the election of potentially aggressive parties throughout the Middle East .
You have not said what you think about &amp; apos ; more Europe &amp; apos ; .
If tomorrow you receive the approval of this House - and I hope this is the case - you have a huge job to do on behalf of all the citizens of Europe .
He has been very willing to listen . Together with the work carried out by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development this has resulted in a splendid European Parliament report .
We will see whether this is achieved within a few days .
Mr President , I would like to report something to Parliament and ask for its support .
There is no urgency because we passed a resolution in December , and the matter needs further thought , so we think it is better to ad@@ journ the debate for two months .
We need to take into account that part of social responsibility , which we will call the legally binding part , which , above all , has to do with respecting human rights .
As has been stated , we are aware that Kazakhstan &amp; apos ; s record regarding the protection of freedom , respect for human rights and consolidation of the democratic process is unsatisfactory , but it is also a fact that some positive progress has been made , allowing us to hope that that country has now started on its way down the right road , leading to implementation of the agreement .
And this , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , must be taken into account when the Commission produces its article 7 report and when we try - as we are trying - to implement the common market .
The causes are many and varied , and the report has been able to mention and summarise the most important ones .
Moreover , beyond the Greek crisis , I think that we can conclude that the last few weeks have been very illumin@@ ating .
We will have to await the result of these prim@@ aries before we know which candidates will fight the elections to take place on 28 January .
I appreciate the assessment you have made on the fine start to our Presidency and , furthermore , I also must tell you that the Commission has an idea to present a Green Paper at the start of this year on forest protection .
If one State is failing to fulfil the conditions for democracy then it cannot be a Member of the Community .
However , the assessment of its activities has been positive .
Our main concern in the Socialist Group is to ensure that we do not destroy what we have already achieved , namely Agenda 2000 itself .
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on this initiative and acknowledge the excellent work Mr Lisi has done by means of the different parliamentary process we have seen .
This is what I believe this House should do tomorrow : wal@@ k on , resolve the differences we still have with the Council , but look towards a time when the crisis is hitting all Europeans .
Mrs Schreyer , you have just mentioned the Council , saying that there was a Member State that opposed the creation of a European Prosecutor .
Naturally , I will pass on this concern to the Spanish Minister for Labour and Social Affairs to see whether , in a forthcoming sitting of the Social Affairs Council - which has still to meet before the Presidency draws to a close - we can deal with this issue once again .
I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteurs , because their excellent work has meant that the firmness of our position as the European Parliament regarding these proposals has been made clear . They are proposals that have no other purpose than to make the European maritime space one of the sa@@ f@@ est in the world and to contribute to the reorganisation of the European fleets , as well as ensuring that operators take greater responsibility for damage caused to third parties and , in particular , national assets .
Nevertheless , we can see a few problems which I would like to mention briefly .
He says that the conditions are in place for Europe to work properly , but the population knows that it is not going well .
People are displaced by the violence of war and terrorism , and until those things stop , they cannot return to their homes without their lives being endangered .
Mr President , I have listened very carefully to the Commission &amp; apos ; s speech , which I believe was very correct .
However , there are two issues that concern us .
It is also necessary to stress the fundamental role played by women in peace @-@ building building processes and we are therefore calling upon the Commission and the Council , as well as the Member States involved in the management of conflicts , for greater sensitivity to the issue of guaranteeing the technical and financial assistance necessary to promote programmes to enable women to be actors with their own voices in those processes , as requested by groups of Koso@@ van women , for example , who are asking to be included in the negotiating delegation , whose current seven members are all men .
The euro and Economic and Monetary Union have undeniably been a success .
This report is a positive step , as was the report presented in this House a few years ago by the President .
At the same time we should consider fiscal and commercial measures to slow trade both in highly polluting products and in products which have been manufactured using dir@@ ty technology .
I believe that the Fisheries Agreement is something that can and must help , provided that we involve our sea@@ men and fishermen much more in the economic development of these islands , for their own benefit and also for the benefit of the European Union .
I believe that all political communities are judged by the justice they provide .
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Cornelissen for his superb work in drafting this report and , as usual with him , in everything he does .
In this context , the directives we are discussing today are essential legislative instruments which contribute to preserving our environment by persuading businesses in the sector to internalise the cost of certain environmental impacts and to adopt a committed position without abandoning their market objectives .
In this respect , we are also providing something very important for the European technology sector : the European railways industry , which includes some of the world &amp; apos ; s most techno@@ logically advanced industries , is being given the possibility of operating within a massive internal market of great dimensions which will lead to a lowering of costs and greater profits , which will therefore optimise all production and greater competitiveness at international and world level , beyond our European borders .
Thirdly , strengthening security , the fight against terrorism and the consolidation of a European immigration and asylum strategy .
Our group &amp; apos ; s position on the Laschet report has been one of broad agreement , with the emphasis on certain fundamental aspects .
We must also explain another great success : the enlargement processes .
Madam President , as has already been said , our group is naturally in favour of the respect for and promotion of human rights and freedoms , as well as the right of peoples to determine their future .
Does the programme outlined to us complement the Interreg I@@ IB Community initiative concerning trans @-@ European European energy networks ?
However , our neighbourhood policy has been lacking in credibility .
I consider that the proposed European victim protection system , which I personally demanded from the Spanish Presidency during the Stockholm Programme debates , and which has finally come to fruition , will be an effective instrument for fighting such crimes .
Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party , it is a real pleasure for me to take the floor to talk about this report by Mr Oostlander .
However , it is the case that migratory flows towards the European Union have increased dra@@ matically in recent times and our capacity for reception is not unlimited .
The door is closed to them and we have lost that added value provided by the direct relationship between the European capital and the public institutions closest to the problems of the citizens .
On the other hand , this Protocol provides a natural step towards the signing of the new agreement , which could be under threat given the political situation in the country and the possible presence of other fleets in the event that the European Union were absent from the area .
On that occasion , I pointed out that , when the hur@@ ric@@ ane struck , the Commission acted quickly in terms of initial aid .
Of course , globalisation is not a panacea for all evi@@ ls .
Madam President , I believe that nobody doubts today , and nor should they , that the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman contribute to two fundamental principles of European construction : the application of Community law and also the institutions &amp; apos ; knowledge of the citizens .
The budgetary situation is particularly difficult in four countries which were not able to consolidate their public finances during the period of strong growth : Portugal , Germany , France and Italy .
In an era of globalisation , the dilemma that developing nations face is as harsh as it is simple : if we cannot export more and more goods and services , we will end up exporting more and more people .
I am very happy to hear that the Commissioner is going to present us with a very specific communication on an action plan to combat poverty .
These articles apply both to the participating Member States and to the Member States with exceptions .
I believe that this is a situation that should also be put in force so that , ultimately , no citizens of the European Union are prevented from expressing themselves in their mother tongue , in their own language , which should share equal official status with any other language that can be used in that state .
In other words , there is no problem in this respect .
When we analyse the global strategy - and this is the content of the synthesis report - the emphasis is on the need to make progress in the various areas simultaneously in order to achieve the goals we set in Lisbon .
However , I also believe that Parliament cannot make its work dependent on the anticipated entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , or suspend it on this basis .
Not to speak for too long , and as the Commissioner will be present at the Council negotiations , I would like to give him a little advice . He should remind the Council how this Parliament operates .
I think that the Union must keep on paying great attention , as it is doing - and of course doing so very well - to the humanitarian situation of refugees , to the situation of many children , men and women in the camps , and we shall have to do our utmost , as the Commissioner was saying , to resolve this conflict .
Madam President , first of all I wish to express our support for the work carried out by Mrs Palacio because we can also conclude from it that the correct application of the subsidiarity principle should mean bringing European citizens closer to the decision @-@ making making process in initiatives leading to the development and consolidation of the European Union .
Mr President , I shall retain only one point from the speech I had prepared and that is to congratulate the rapporteur on her competent work .
The second point , Mr President , consists of expressly pointing out something that this Parliament has included in its Rules of Procedure : the Charter is already binding for us ; for us , the Members of the European Parliament , this is already the parameter in accordance with which we must ensure that legislative initiatives conform to fundamental rights .
Yes , Mr de Miguel , &amp; apos ; More Europe &amp; apos ; , a bigger Europe , but not a hol@@ low , empty Europe .
That , I think is the guideline which should be at the centre , at the very heart of our strategy which , between us all , must be implemented within the next few months , before the European Council in June to replace the inadequate Lisbon Strategy .
In that review of the pan @-@ European European corridors we will have to deal specifically and very dyna@@ m@@ ically with those works which represent a connection of European territory via non @-@ European European territory , as in the case of certain countries of the former Yugoslavia in the Balkans region .
Some of you have asked what we are going to do about these matters .
The next item is the Commission statement on collective redress .
The scope of the report and the constructive opinions it contains will help us push forward and consolidate the implementation of the energy efficiency action plan .
Our political group believes that this contribution must be as ambitious as possible , but also that it should not prejudice other geographical areas .
Therefore , Commissioner , I pra@@ y that there will be excellent cooperation between us , which we are going to need , and the capacity for negotiation so that this project can be taken to its conclusion .
But unfortunately other countries are not in such an advanced situation and we therefore propose a limit date .
It is only fair to note that , in the last fortnight , Parliament and the Council have demonstrated more of the willingness and flexibility required to reach agreement on the amendments we wished to introduce . I trust the latter will be adopted tomorrow morning .
We cannot accept some of the amendments that have been adopted in Committee or that have been submitted once again to this House .
That is my comment and that is the comment included in our report .
The proposal was not the exclusive property of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group ; it could be said that it came from Parliament as a whole .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is unacceptable that such a basic universal principal as accessibility to healthcare should be established solely under the rules of the internal market .
I feel it is helpful to allow a slight increase in new planting , and also welcome the measures designed to allow new young growers to become involved in this traditional process .
I believe that the Agency can carry out great work in coordinating national policies , to give greater added value to all policies that are put in place .
The Committee on Transport and Tourism originally approved Amendment 46 , presented by myself , and Amendment 50 , presented by Mr Sterckx .
If there is fraud in any country , the Commission must fight against it .
The euro has shown that it is still an attractive currency which some countries want to join .
We have also supported certain changes to accounting rules and the fast @-@ tracking tracking of bank recapitali@@ sation and bank deposi@@ t guarantee schemes .
All the features of the system which may lead to confusion between own resources and national contributions are highlighted .
Furthermore , there is the fear that the process of economic globalisation will increase the difficulties of the poorest countries and widen the chasm that separates them from the wealthy countries .
Fifthly , I very much agree with paragraphs 81 and 82 on compensation .
It has also achieved this - I would like to stress - in accordance with the agreements and mandates reached at the European Council in Tampere .
I do not think either side will agree to this .
The governments that I mentioned a moment ago are interested in developing this strategy , and we need to wait for the Commission to publish its communication .
It is being kept within the 20 % limit , thereby observing the &amp; apos ; gentlemen &amp; apos ; s agreement &amp; apos ; , even though that does not exist . We all talk about savings , some of us with partisan intentions , but we all have some shared priorities : for example , we Members want legislative out@@ put to be improved ; we are called on to respond to the new priorities of the Treaty of Lisbon ; we are asked to work more professionally in co @-@ decisions decisions ; we are asked for more meeting ro@@ oms , more internal security , greater efforts in communication policy , better IT networks , and so on .
In relation to the coordination of economic policy , there is no doubt that the consolidation of the internal market and greater integration and interdependence amongst the economies of all the Member States points to the need for greater coordination of economic policies throughout the region and particularly in the eurozone .
Mr President , in answer to the second question , the European Commission &amp; apos ; s position is well known .
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach .
In this respect , we can feel proud that now something has been done .
We must do the rest through an open debate and joint work amongst us and , please , let us not increase divisions .
Mr President , Commissioner , what we are seeing here is a clear imbalance between Parliament &amp; apos ; s insistence on the issue of Western Sahara and the Council &amp; apos ; s silence .
With regard to these two issues : the WTO and Russia &amp; apos ; s status as a market economy , one of the most important points in the relationship between the European Union and Russia is the energy dialogue .
In both cases we hope for a satisfactory resolution following the vote on Thursday .
Why did the negotiations fail ?
With this in mind , we propose the following oral amendments to the compromise text :
In the case of climate change , we cannot allow ourselves to repeat this mistake if we want to prevent dangerous and possibly catastro@@ phic economic and social consequences in the coming decades .
With regard to these amendments , the Commission fully agrees with the spirit of Nos 1 , 6 , 10 , 11 , 15 , 19 , 21 and 22 , and can accept them in principle , even though they raise important issues relating to the method of financing the security measures .
Fourthly , as regards assessment and monitoring , we unfortunately have to point out that no complete and detailed study has yet been carried out on the first Structural Funds Programme .
For my part , I have tried , through dialogue , to reach a fundamental consensus with everybody who has shown an interest in this work .
We also hope that the Commissioner and the Presidency @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council will demonstrate their commitment to ensuring that , through everybody &amp; quot ; s efforts , this Vienna Summit is a success .
There is currently considerable disparity between the positions adopted by the Member States and there are important issues to resolve .
I would like to say that we withdraw the final part of the amendment , as requested by the PPE Group , in exchange for their support for this amendment .
I know that it will be the job of the Swedish Presidency , but in March we need to look at the perspective for 2002 , and what are we going to do ?
However , if we continue to look into history , we will also see both good things and bad things about Turkey .
On behalf of my group I should therefore like to thank the Commission for its efforts . Thanks are also due , of course , to the Presidency @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the European Union .
I fully support the dates and the quantitative objectives set in it .
I have already referred to my solid commitment to enlargement .
In drawing up this report , I am not setting out to take a severe or harsh approach towards the Commission .
I believe that we in Parliament must dedicate all our resources to the European Union taking a step , which it has taken for the first time on its own , demonstrating that it has the capacity to re @-@ establish establish normality in a continent to which it owes an enormous historical debt .
Firstly , with regard to budget Title 12 , &amp; apos ; Internal Market &amp; apos ; , I would just like to say that what the committee aimed to do through our amendments was to recover the amounts in the P@@ D@@ B that had been envisaged by the Commission , which the Council document had subsequently reduced .
I would turn now to a third factor . An important topic when it comes to the behaviour of economies is the way in which supply operates in relation to demand and whether the growth in demand is more rapid than existing supply .
In this context , we are also rather concerned about Turkey &amp; apos ; s part in the action plan .
Even if only one innocent person had been executed , this universal moratorium and the abolition of the death penalty would still be worth fighting for .
I would like to end my contribution by asking you to continue cooperating with governments to achieve the objectives set out and would also call upon all of us to continue the work of making the public more aware of why we are undertaking a project of such historic proportions .
With regard to the functioning of the College of Commissioners , I would like to say , from this Chamber , that we will not allow the individual responsibility of the Commissioners to be used as a weapon .
The Europe of freedoms , solidarity and equality must therefore ensure that regrettable cases such as this do not arise again in any part of our European Union .
However , and I cannot stress this enough , the environmental constraints governing the economic , social and fiscal policies of the Union and its Member States continue to be inadequate .
Madam President , Mr Posselt , you will be perfectly aware that one of the main instruments of our relations concerning the human rights issue in China is the bi@@ annual human rights dialogue which was set up more than 15 years ago .
Mr President , I would like to protest at the absurd nocturnal and almost clandestine hour allocated to a debate which should be one of the most important debates of the year .
I would like to say to you that during this period , progress has been made on the directive to combat people trafficking .
Madam President , I do not intend to speak for five minutes . I would just like to ask you , given your generosity and knowledge of the region to which I am going to refer , to allow me to speak on a point of order .
The European Council has accepted the idea of doub@@ ling the European and national parliamentary presence .
In this report we ask you to ad@@ mon@@ ish the Member States , to initiate proceedings against those that have not complied and to continue using all legal means within your power , all in order to ensure that this legislation is complied with .
H@@ und@@ reds of thousands of jobs have been lost , not only in northern , but also in southern Europe .
Firstly , let us hope that the High Representative , Mr Solana , is right to predict that an agreement may be possible before 6 February - In@@ sh@@ alla@@ h - but let us not forget that Sharon is still casting his shadow .
I believe that this is something that we , as Europeans , can be pleased about .
I also think that we need to develop and draw up a code of good administrative behaviour which would help the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman in their work and thus help make European integration more meaningful for the people of Europe .
Firstly , we must show the Commission , the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident .
The more strategic approach will give stability to the guidelines on the different policies and allow them to be better monitored .
There is a danger , and another potential deviation , in allowing certain bodies or certain sectors to self @-@ regulate regulate .
I hope you can reconsider this amendment , because I really think it would be better for everyone .
In this respect , we believe that we must be extremely strict .
This will facilitate the application of the Dublin Convention which , as you well know , determines the Member State responsible for the examination of asylum applications .
In that way Parliament put an end to what the Court of Auditors had been condemning since 198@@ 1 and which it reiterated in its report 4 / 97 : a latent conflict which exists between the power to grant an approval - and hence to authorise an item of expenditure - and the task of assessing it soon after according to criteria of good financial management .
While recognising the inherent characteristics of these services , we cannot ignore their economic impact on the direct and indirect costs they imply .
The difference in salaries also has an equal impact in Europe , and lack of security is also affecting jobs done by women who have higher @-@ level level training .
A final point , Mr President of the Commission , is that Parliament asked last month for a proposal to the Convention for a legal basis for the protection of pluralism in the European media .
We are presenting clear proposals for the conciliation of 20 July , which the Council should not reject , because they represent the majority will of this House elected by the citizens of Europe .
We also need to know the impact of industrial fishing on other populations of white fish , because that may perhaps provide the key to explaining the decline of cod and hake .
Mr President , the problem is more important when we cooperate with the Commission .
The first is that almost 80 % of European citizens live in urban areas .
We have to work responsibly and not be motivated purely by our self @-@ interest interest as Europeans . It is true , however , that the Latin American crisis may destabili@@ se the European economy if we fail to express our solidarity and to take prompt and decisive action to safeguard the future .
The aid offered has contributed to stabilising and miti@@ gating the effects of the economic crisis .
We all agree that security is very important , but another key aspect is who pays for that security and how we try to improve transparency and a better distribution of costs .
In other words , it is perfectly possible for citizens to gain access to this information .
And , in this regard , it should be recalled that the Community was founded on the basis of a ty@@ p@@ ically European socio @-@ economic economic doctrine .
Mr President , this evening we are talking about small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises .
And thirdly , the report records that , in spite of their commercial nature , the fisheries agreements provide certain benefits for developing countries contracting with the European Union .
We know that that dialogue must include the recognition of the Palestinian State as one of its fundamental conditions .
The European Parliament has always been in the vanguard in the fight against terrorism , despite the limited role attributed to it by the Treaties in this area .
A clear list of actions which may not be included should also be drafted , to provide legal certainty and speed up and facilitate the preparation of programmes .
At present we have no time to make an assessment of the projec@@ ted reform , but I would like to point out that the draft took no note of the recommendations put forward by the group of experts in 1992 .
I do not wish to end my intervention without mentioning the first rapporteur of this report , Mrs Ben@@ as@@ sar .
In my opinion , this resolution contains a series of essential points , but I would like to stress one in particular , that is , the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations .
We await the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal for reform which you have announced and which Vice @-@ President President Kinnock is due to present in February .
I would like to highlight the fact that the great majority of this Parliament understood both structural needs and supported a joint solution from the outset .
If there is no acknowledgement of the right to disagree and the right to political dis@@ sent , then there is no freedom .
How can it be controlled ?
And as you have just heard , ladies and gentlemen , given the things that have happened during this last month alone , we have no choice but to play that role , whether we like it or not : we cannot close our eyes to the world &amp; quot ; s problems , and I would like to say to you that the world wants Europe to act .
Through this vote today , we want to send a message to the Council that this is Parliament &amp; apos ; s will ; now it is up to the Council to take on its responsibilities .
Let us be clear about this .
Nor can we dis@@ card , whenever possible , a genuine multilateral approach with a view to improving standardisation , and the need to improve mechanisms within the WTO framework ; all this will prove extremely useful .
These are the basic principles that we share with the Commission .
Following the February recommendations , the Commission &amp; apos ; s services are also studying this second interim report .
Secondly , Madam President , we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people .
There have been significant changes in legislation , especially the 2003 modernisation package , crucial legal judgments have been passed in this area and the Commission has learnt quite a lot from practice , which is also an important aspect .
Some governments , such as the Spanish Government , are opposed to their country &amp; apos ; s domestic plurality being reflected in the construction of Europe .
Therefore , increasing the awareness of small and medium @-@ sized sized businesses is still one of the fundamental concerns of our communication .
Over the first nine years they will draw up three energy efficiency action plans , which will detail the measures taken and the future objectives .
The exce@@ ed@@ ingly cautious nature of Article 129 of the Treaty , concerning health , recommends certain actions which underpin the approach of the Member States .
Commissioner , apart from the boost and the confidence that we can give our farmers with these new measures , we are on the way to future reforms , major reforms that will be discussed further in Parliament .
We know that both donors and partner countries are responsible for aid being more effective , but our greatest responsibility is to ensure that aid really contributes to helping developing countries meet the major challenges they face .
In my view , this is a matter of interest and one that should be debated .
By the way , this is an entirely public dimension , because there are Commission proposals and furthermore I would like to point out that tomorrow and the next day the Justice and Home Affairs Council will meet and deal with all of these issues .
As I am responsible for matters concerning multilingualism , I would like to point out that the Bureau of the European Parliament is currently studying a new system .
Firstly , because the enlargement of the European Union obliges us to do so .
I would like to highlight a series of specific points from the Trentin report that I consider to be important .
The first is the anticipated increase in illnesses in the Union resulting from the rise in unemployment and the marginalization of large sectors of the population .
I believe that this would increase the coherence of the text .
As a Member of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , I must point out that the production of deep sea oil and gas is important to security of supply in the EU .
I also want to welcome the return to the traditional system of budgetary guidelines .
They are horizontal reports , with which the enormous majority of Members of this Parliament identify , and which I believe reflect great forward @-@ thinking thinking and a great effort to achieve unity .
For all of these reasons , I recommend that , under these conditions , the European Parliament approve the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals , modifying and extending the Per@@ icles programme .
Improving quality must not only be directed at Community legislation but also at the legislation of the Member States .
In January Mr Aznar applied the motto &amp; apos ; More Europe &amp; apos ; to enlargement .
Fri@@ ends and colleagues , yes , Mr President , but when it comes to defending our interests , we must be as resolute as they are .
Firstly , more Europe means a better Europe insofar as it means less economic power for the Member States .
I would like to highlight here something that I see as a very positive element in the report , that when we turn to the market , there should be an obligation that the products be EU produced , locally s@@ our@@ ced , and fresh .
Many initiatives are taking place at the moment ; initiatives which we hope will bring success , with the possibility of a final and definitive summit before the elections of 6 February .
The southern Mediterranean countries are beg@@ ging us to make a determined effort to come up with solutions quickly .
These days , in spite of the 19@@ 75 directive - with which Mr Fl@@ ynn is very familiar - on equal pay for men and women , there continues to be a 25 or 30 % gender gap in ear@@ nings for the same type of work .
We will monitor compliance with the recommendations of the resolution we are debating today .
The current regulation - which I think is totally correct - proposes a system for the allocation of these permits between the Fifteen Member States .
In recent days there have also been acts of terrorism in other regions of the European Union . People are demanding that we , the representatives of the European peoples , should not just issue a condemnation , Mr President , but also commit ourselves to initiative and to boosting Community policies to combat terrorism .
We need to change this model for one based on sustainable development and respect for nature , which can allow society to develop a similar attitude .
Finally , the amendments on technical requirements , specifically Amendments Nos 4 , 5 and 16 , are acceptable , although the final text of Amendment No 4 will reflect the solution to the problem in question as found by the Council .
Nevertheless , I would call on the Commission to pursue this objective energetically .
The impact of this rise has been particularly great in the European Union and especially in the euro zone , owing to the euro &amp; apos ; s value against the dollar .
A framework of best practices should be established in order to encourage balanced relations between the different players in the food chain , avoiding abusive practices and promoting fairer distribution of commercial margins .
The public will accept the euro if it helps resolve the problems they are worried about .
I think that the two reports complement each other and really do contain some innovative and very interesting proposals .
However , in the draft budget , the Council has eliminated a budgetary heading that the Commission had included to this end and I would therefore ask what this means .
Mr President , Commissioner , the fact that we in this Parliament are once again debating fires demonstrates that there is something we are not doing entirely right .
And it turns out that the European Community was very badly defended .
It is undoubtedly a difficult issue which changes certain fundamental elements of our European Union tradition , and that is the notion of the rotating six @-@ month month Presidency .
This Summit also ought to approve the Euro @-@ Latin Latin American Foundation , a type of think tan@@ k for the development of bi @-@ regional regional relations , and give our relationship some much @-@ needed needed visibility , since regrettably it is not well known in Europe .
There can be no doubt that the diversification of clean energy sources must continue to be the main priority in energy policy .
Despite this significant development , there is still potential for progress .
The work of these international organisations seems to be even more necessary at present when the Russian Federation has the firm intention to take a series of steps towards the political normalisation of Chechnya .
In Afghanistan , history has demonstrated that there can be no military solution .
Ladies and gentlemen , I have little more to tell you at this point .
Another interesting idea is the European initiative on the creation of the financial conditions required for a genuine accompanying policy to help families and provide education for children . The Commission will obviously have to consider this matter .
Over these three years we have been working on this issue , and today is the day to achieve concrete results .
Having said this , it should not be necessary to point out that all the Member States should act in accordance with these intentions .
In other words , we defend human rights and we also defend dialogue , meeting and agreement .
Furthermore , I believe that this proposed resolution is a necessary gesture by the European Parliament towards the Member States as an expression of the renewal of a political will in each of them to combat climate change and to intensify the establishment of the mechanisms necessary for the ratification of the protocol .
The Summit must produce a mandate to begin and , where necessary , to enhance , the negotiation towards an Association Agreement with the Andean Community , with Central America and with Mercosur .
The Commission is having problems with incorporating concrete measures aimed at checking and improving the effectiveness of these management systems , which account for more than 80 % of the budget , into its overall strategy .
If the Commission wants to change the rules of the game , it should first explain what it plans to do , when and how it is going to do it .
I am including all types of fraud which could occur in the European institutions .
The Dary report is a difficult and in@@ tric@@ ate piece of work which is worthy of praise , and has allowed us to unanimously approve a report on a truly complex issue .
This was why I contac@@ ted Mr Novelli , as he had already worked on this report , and also , out of parliamentary courtesy , I thought it was appropriate to consult him as to whether he wanted to put forward the only text that could receive a consensus , which was the Commission &amp; apos ; s text , and Mr Novelli agreed , which I thank him for .
Some matters which caused us concern in the final proposal were also clearly accepted .
I urge you to give careful consideration to the matter . We may be called upon to show Canada the extent to which it has become a thor@@ n in the flesh of its relationship with the European Union .
In any case , we hope that it is decided to maintain the ones that are really significant for this report .
Mr President , I have been mentioned by name , accused of having the wrong Parliament .
In the action plan approved at the Africa Summit I also saw references to readmission agreements and other instruments , but will those undertakings be honoured ?
Directive 93 / 104 / EC is intended to guarantee a higher level of health and safety protection for workers , as reiterated in Directive 2000 / 34 / EC .
Ladies and Gen@@ tlemen , the work carried out by the Council , the Commission and Parliament in this field has its good and bad points .
Madam President , I , like other Members , would like to thank Mr Trakatellis for his perseverance .
The Commission accepts the vast majority of the proposed amendments , with some changes to the wording in certain cases .
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , the Presidency of the Council will realise that I am not satisfied by references to mere written declarations .
This call for responsibility is the most important part of the Commission &amp; apos ; s communication , followed of course by the implementation of the measures and national plans .
I believe that over these six months - and this is what I should stress most - the Presidency has received great support from the European Commission at all times , and it still is receiving it ; thanks to the efforts of the European Commission - and its right of initiative , in accordance with which it has presented its proposals - we have been able to resolve and do many things .
This is why we consider that this compromise represents a significant step forward , not only in relation to this specific proposal , but in order to lay the foundations for future discussions between the Council , the Commission and Parliament on fisheries policy .
We are not dealing with mere preparatory work , but with an expression of solutions supported by national parliaments and the European Parliament - which represents the citizens of Europe - and by representatives of the governments and the Member States .
I will illustrate what I have said by means of an example .
In summary , thank you very much , Commissioner , for your information and your work .
However , from my perspective and as I understand it , Parliament should not , as you said , be cur@@ bing those producers who decided to respond positively to the demands of the market .
I therefore draw your attention in particular to the recommendation contained in section 4 which , in relation to that in section 3 , seeks to direct our decisions in the field of development aid towards the objective of combating the structural problems .
I only hope - and I congratulate you on your Presidency - that your successors will deal with this issue with the same care as you .
We are therefore aware that great numbers of asylum seekers and immigrants are currently reaching Malta &amp; quot ; s shores .
In terms of institutional architecture , I would agree with the rapporteur , Mr Schmidt , that now is probably not a good time for publication of the full minutes .
Mr President , I intervene to support the report by Mrs Sanders @-@ ten ten Holte .
We do not think this will be the last case ; strong measures need to be taken requiring negotiation with the workers , as called for in the European Works Council Directive and the Col@@ lec@@ tive Re@@ d@@ un@@ dan@@ cies Directive .
We must add to this the persecution of certain groups suffering as a result of their religious af@@ fi@@ lia@@ tions , as has been said , as I believe this Resolution stresses quite correctly .
Thank you , Madam President , and may it be so , as we say in my country .
There are lessons to be learnt from all this .
in writing . - Having had my speech interrupted by the President , who applied speaking time much more strictly to me than to the colleagues before me , I wish to add a few comments .
What I want to know is whether the Council considers this to be an issue worthy of its attention or not .
The High Representative said during his last appearance that , surely , on the basis of the Mitchell and Tenet plans , what we had to do was speed up and create a Palestinian State .
I am therefore bound to agree with the rapporteur . I believe that if the report were approved as it now stands , it would not prove to be a document offering useful insi@@ ghts or significant contributions to the current debate on competition , despite the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s good work .
What is more , this agreement means we are also strengthening the country &amp; apos ; s democratisation process .
I am sure , therefore , that from now on he will also defend the rights of my political party and the Socialist Party to assembly and freedom of speech .
Mr President , the rapporteur correctly maintains that climate change is one of the most serious environmental problems we are facing today .
I believe that these two factors can allow us to go to Johannesburg with the conviction that we belong to a group of countries which lead the world on all the great issues of sustainable development .
We frequently see how the affected regions of the Member States , sometimes of the most developed ones , lack sufficient resources to deal with these phenomena themselves .
The Union &amp; apos ; s best budgetary policy is not one that allows for a high budgetary expenditure , but one which implements the commitments in the Budget well .
Lastly , the third point that must be made is how to deal with the new threats , which are terrorism , the proliferation of weapons and failed states ...
Because although it seems obvious , we must remember that in this conflict the person who is threatening world peace , failing to comply with international law and presenting us with the real risk that international terrorists may acquire chemical and bac@@ teri@@ ological weapons is Saddam Hussein .
So we need to adopt the amendments if we want the European Union to become a model in promotion of equality of treatment .
Thanks to the introduction of the euro , it has become obvious that price differences between the Member States still exist .
On the one hand - and this is no small thing - the process has continued , despite the negative factors that have affected the Middle East peace process .
Nevertheless , the rapporteur must acknowledge that there have been enormous difficulties within the Committee on Legal Affairs and , in order to make the negotiation of this directive possible , has had to accept a series of compromise amendments that make up the current text , which has been adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs .
My impression is that the agreement that has been reached is an agreement based not on the Union &amp; apos ; s needs but on the negotiation of national interests .
Wor@@ se , however , is its disregard of the recommendation of this Parliament about the need to strike a better balance at the Court between men and women .
These reforms have undoubtedly benefited from the fact that Turkey &amp; apos ; s candida@@ ture has been acknowledged and from the prospect of its joining the Union in the future .
Finally , Mr President , I think this Parliament needs a clear majority to approve these reports tomorrow . Parliament will have more say in the codecision process if its position is firm and clear , like the one approved in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
At European level , the involvement of the social partners has improved since the first attempts at the beginning of the seven@@ ties , but progress has been much too slow .
Thirdly , concerning foreign policy , the close cooperation and concerted action on regional conflicts and reconstruction processes was highlighted .
What implications does this have for the new transatlantic agenda ?
Mr President , first of all I want to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done all this time on these two very important proposals .
Each of the Member States has an interest in promoting this modernisation of the railways , but there is also a very obvious European interest in promoting the modernisation of the trans @-@ European European railway system .
Nevertheless , despite the difficulties and problems raised in the debates on instruments laid down and proposed to implement the provisions of the Treaty , in particular on the basis of the guidelines laid down in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council , the commitment and efforts made at Council level to speed up their examination and adoption , and thus create a basis for a body of binding legislation for the Community as a whole in this respect , should be highlighted .
I would like to stress that the regulations on COMs and on the Structural Funds must be complied with and the budget is not the correct stage of the procedure to amend them .
We are talking about a financial contribution aimed at confronting these difficulties .
However , Frontex is a new @-@ born born inf@@ ant , a child of the EU that can only grow up and carry out its function with support from its parents , the Member States , whom we would ask to make good their undertakings by supplying the human and logistics resources required .
I very much doubt whether the Commission currently possesses the resources and commitment to set about strengthening , as other speakers have already mentioned , the Customs systems of these V@@ ise@@ grad countries .
Madam President , in my opinion , furthermore , this article is not applicable , and I will tell you why : Parliament is asked to take note . It does not have the option of making a political assessment .
During his visit to Brussels , and in the context of the human rights dialogue that the European Union regularly holds with the United States , concern was expressed by the European Union about the use of the so @-@ called called military com@@ missions and prolonged detention without trial , and naturally , we expressed our opposition to the death penalty .
The Council has reopened it and , therefore , we believe that we must provide a margin for flexibility .
I merely wished to say in relation to Mr Rack &amp; apos ; s report that I had another two issues to comment on , and I feel the Commissioner is quite sensitive to these .
Therefore , this proposal contributes by giving more security to the entire process . For that reason we give our full support to Professor Cabrol &amp; apos ; s report , to which he has impar@@ ted the best of his knowledge and professional authority .
And in this case , we can see that there are certain discrepancies between the Commission proposal and what is now being suggested by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
I have seen at least two references that seem to be of interest : Why do we not speak of sustainable development ? What is happening with the enlargement of the European Union ?
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully , and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result .
Mr President , I shall be pleased to answer the request put to me .
This does not mean that the commercial aspects are the most important , naturally .
But I believe that we must place much more emphasis on what unites us rather than what separates us .
This is a tragedy , it has nothing to do with security .
I would very much like some measure to be taken in this regard .
I am in total agreement with the priorities the rapporteur sets out in point five of his report , provided we do not forget the amounts set in Turin .
There is no doubt that it is the most important advance to take place in Europe since the birth of the Community , forty odd years ago .
We have a policy based on incentive schemes and to apply it we have the special mechanism of the GSP at our disposal .
Today we are presenting the European Parliament report on the Community patent .
This is undoubtedly a clear demonstration of the need for initiatives of this type with a view to acceler@@ ating and making a genuine contributing to the construction of the European area of justice which we agreed on in Tampere .
We know that what we are asking for will require a great deal of effort , and we are therefore considering the need to extend the resources allocated to human rights units , both in the Commission and in the Council , the latter not being present at this debate .
Amendment No 25 , which broa@@ den@@ s the definition of the insu@@ rer , because it would unfairly discriminate against third @-@ country country insu@@ rers and would violate the Community &amp; apos ; s international obligations in relation to financial services .
If you would also allow me , Mr President , I would like to thank all those who have actively and loy@@ ally collaborated in this electoral process .
All these objectives must be achieved in the next few years and , in order to ensure they are complied with , we are requesting a new meeting within the next five years .
But we do not want to call on the countries of the European Union - which are net contributors - to withdraw funds , because we are aware that the work it carries out on peace and humanitarian issues is very important .
The European Union &amp; apos ; s action had become that invisible .
Besides this now traditional complaint , this proposal for a regulation represents an opportunity to debate the real problem of flags of convenience and discuss what the European Union is doing to deal with them .
This was demonstrated by the Americans who , after the Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ dez disaster , within one year , adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation , which threatens , as I said earlier , to diver@@ t ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe .
I would therefore ask you to pass this on personally since the Council should have been represented here .
It is also important to stress that the directive deals with a work problem which unfortunately affects women more than men : sexual harassment , which will not only be prosecuted and punished , but prevention measures will also be adopted in companies .
In any event , ladies and gentlemen , I am convinced that there is a solid basis for a final agreement , and that together we will find a sound solution for all the people of Europe .
At this moment in time , the Committee on Legal Affairs is preparing a report on the recognition of certi@@ fied documents in various European Union countries , which should complement this report .
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement .
This approach is especially important in terms of our efforts to consolidate , deepen and broaden the political dialogue .
I would like to specifically highlight the decisions and agreements made at the Barcelona Summit , which , if properly presented , will enable those citizens who are currently not exactly enthusiastic to change their views .
In this regard , too , the Lisbon Treaty lays the foundations for us to be able to finally develop a common anti @-@ terrorism terrorism policy in the European Union .
Mr President , our Group feels , as Mr Teverson has said in his magnificent report , that the structural funds are the main instrument for reducing inequalities between the various countries of the European Union and strengthening economic and social cohesion .
In this respect , we must accept that , with a miserly budget , we are not going to be able to achieve the image , the appropriate coordination , an unequivocal presence in the UN@@ O , or in other international bodies , and we should therefore revise the financial perspectives in that direction .
Great effort will be required in terms of cooperation and control between Parliament , the Commission and the Member States .
The Council and Parliament must also fulfil their respective responsibilities and face up to the challenges confronting us .
There is not .
The incoherences of the Socialist Group and its complete lack of ideas and sensible proposals is therefore alarming .
Our collective experience on this continent , which has been involved in conflicts and horro@@ rs throughout the last century , makes Europeans particularly sensitive to the absolute need to develop and affirm international criminal justice as an instrument of service to human rights and humanitarian standards worldwide .
We have debated the ancillary clauses while the Council was delaying the basic decisions .
How could the procedure be improved ?
Mr President , ladies and gentleman , Commissioner , I would like firstly to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached .
In order to ensure consistency and fairness in resolving differences between authorities or between the different financial sectors we need to abandon unilateralism and progress towards a genuinely operational European system .
Madam President , I would like to make reference to the Breyer report .
Reports and evidence of torture , humiliation and abuse are not just increasing , but they are becoming increasingly frequent and alarming .
Faced with that we must condemn the massacre - and we do . We must also combat it with all the weapons at our disposal .
This is a call we have to address to all governments .
Specifically , it is very important to negotiate sufficient transitional periods for current aid to maintain investor confidence .
I would therefore ask Mr FÃ¼le to tell Mrs Ashton that the circumstances I have just mentioned should be borne in mind during the application of this resolution &amp; apos ; s mandate . I believe Mr Gah@@ ler is going to request the addition of an oral amendment to the resolution text so that the diplomatic interests of Member States can be protected in Iran .
The European parties are a new instrument that can provide coherence , which can act as the backbone of this political union that we desire , in order to achieve a consensus where it would otherwise be difficult .
We therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx .
I believe that the amendment tabled at the last minute by Mr Vatanen does nothing to help this issue , and I would ask him , if he is listening , to consider the possibility of withdrawing it .
I have suggested that you address this question to the Commission , which , since it leads the high level group on the disabled , will be in a better position than me to give you a concrete answer .
Let us guarantee respect for the rights of migrants .
However , this is not the case : this is a voluntary programme for the Member States .
The interdependence of data protection and security has certainly been debated in Parliament , in particular , during the debate on the Terrorist Finance Tr@@ acking Programme ( TF@@ T@@ P ) , and the debate highlighted the need for Europe to make its own commitment to an appropriate balance between security and privacy .
I am of the opinion that the simplified Treaty revision procedure should be used to create an atmosphere favourable to an in @-@ depth depth discussion of the proposed stability mechanism and of other possible mechanisms , such as the social progress clause .
Thirdly , no international agreement can make sense unless a reciprocity clause applies to both sides .
We agree with the rapporteur and the majority of this House about the objectives involved .
Commissioner , our farmers will once more have to make efforts to adapt .
It is an appeal to citizens , because European civic identity develops when it is put into practice ; not simply when a right is obtained , but when that right is put into practice and exercised .
The Commission has adopted and published some cross @-@ cutting cutting standards explaining the criteria that we are using in these exceptional circumstances to analyse whether those plans comply with the rules of the Treaty . We in the Commission have set a deadline of six months in all cases , because we will then have to - and we will want to - find out what has happened in the six months since our initial authorisation of those plans .
As our rapporteur said , we feel that the Commission is not addressing the issue of this industry with the appropriate seriousness .
I would like to acknowledge the contribution made in this area by the Council of Europe and the Office of the United Nations &amp; apos ; High Commission for Human Rights , and take this opportunity to express the European Union &amp; apos ; s support for the work of these organisations and the OSCE in Chechnya .
With regard to paragraph 1 , as other rapporteurs have mentioned , I believe that its wording is particularly inappropriate . A reading of it would suggest that the European Union &amp; quot ; s unemployment problems are due to the Stability Pact , the Lisbon Strategy , the internal market or competition policy .
Mr President , I am aware that I am going to repeat what the previous speaker said , because it is the same old story .
Thus , we set out to achieve two objectives .
To this end , the competent European authorities have started working on adopting an entire legislative arsen@@ al to combat the terrorist scourge .
I would say that it is not simply a matter of improving coordination and of speaking with one voice .
We know that the Intergovernmental Conference is advancing since everyone has done their duty , but what about the contents ?
Mr President , Commissioners , I am very happy that the assessment made of the European employment strategy allows us to improve the instruments , because this is one of our citizens &amp; apos ; great demands .
Lastly , but no less importantly for all that , I would like to highlight this Chamber &amp; apos ; s steadfas@@ tness in upholding Europe &amp; apos ; s interests and protecting the citizens whom we represent .
The response , contrary to what has been said here , has not been a united European response .
I would like to start by saying that I support and value the agreement reached on TACs and quotas in the December Council .
As you know , this directive has a special significance for me .
We have always sought agreements , but at the same time it is a realistic report .
That proposal is also subject to Council and Parliamentary approval under the codecision procedure and we will therefore have the opportunity to debate it again here in the coming months .
This does not imply that we want to replace the national services in the Member States .
As has been said , a regional aid and reconstruction plan will be necessary and should be launched in January or February . The institutions of the European Union will undoubtedly have to make their financial and budgetary mechanisms more flexible in order to support this plan .
For whatever reason the Council is not going to reply to this question .
Lastly , we have managed to reduce the regulation &amp; apos ; s application deadline by one year .
That said , I must remind you that the competent authority will have access to the precise composition at all times and , as established in the compromise reached , any emergency related to human or animal health or the environment will mean that the purcha@@ sers will have access to precise information on the composition of the feed in question once the legitimate interests of both the manufacturers and the purcha@@ sers have been considered .
I have the impression that the same thing is happening with the euro and with monetary policy .
Please take that into account .
I must say that I am not very optimistic that it will have the effect that most if not all of the European Parliament would like it to have .
We are aware that women do not participate sufficiently in the decision @-@ making making process in politics , business or unions .
It is essential to make the selection and promotion processes open and transparent .
I believe that in this field we can and must agree a text based on a consensus in the future , safeguarding the principles which are essential to this Parliament , such as human rights , fundamental freedoms and non @-@ interference interference in sub judice procedures .
Nevertheless , the texts that we will approve also highlight the lies and agi@@ tation that , in my country specifically , have been demonstrated with regard to this action by the European Parliament , in certain cases and from certain political forces and sectors , even misleading people with regard to its very nature .
This will ensure that the Charter is not wa@@ tered down or distorted in the future .
I am sure subsequent speakers will address other aspects of this resolution , which I hope will be approved tomorrow by a large majority .
We worked very hard on the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals and would have this policy by now were it not for the inefficiency of the Council , which sent us the consultations in December .
We must not take a pa@@ ter@@ n@@ alistic approach to all of this because , above all , we have to respect the identity and cultural characteristics of the Roma population .
We are running the risk of hitting rock bottom very soon .
I would like finally to refer to the question of the flexibility of the labour market and our economies , a flexibility that often - this morning too - is considered to be the only requisi@@ te for growth .
Let us provide ourselves with the necessary mechanism to sanction the violation of human rights , so basic and essential , and let us do it properly , with transparency and , above all , with guarantees .
I should like to thank the members of the secretariat of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure who have co@@ ped intelligently with a huge amount of work . The working members of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure are to be congratulated too for demonstrating the will for positive cooperation throughout .
We believe that the new needs will require additional resources .
The same can be said of the simplification of the GSP + system , which we agree with , but which we believe still requires clarification in terms of the ratification or application of international standards which do not in practice represent an obstacle to the genuine application of the GSP system , as stated by certain Latin American countries such as El Salvador , or key aspects relating to incentives in the fight against drug @-@ trafficking trafficking , which are crucial to countries such as Colombia and Bolivia .
Social Europe should be an area that unites us and not divides us , because we are talking about common European interests .
Mr President , this is not only an arrog@@ ant expression , it also shows contemp@@ t for an oppon@@ ent which is incompatible with the democratic spirit .
The European Parliament has already stated that it would not commit itself to any action which would mean cuts in the aid to other parts of the world .
Our main problem in Spain is terrorism , and fascist positions such as those of Eusk@@ al Her@@ rit@@ arro@@ k are a threat to peace in Spain and in Europe .
As you can see in this budget , this is a political debate which goes beyond a strict examination of what you have done with regard to the 1998 budget .
( The sitting was suspended at 12.@@ 0@@ 5 p.m. and resumed at 12.@@ 45 p.m. )
Furthermore , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is in the process of drawing up a report on this period of reflection and will subsequently present its proposals to us .
As we conclude this stage , an equally promising stage is beginning that requires our full commitment .
Right now , Mr Barak and Mr Arafat must make their people understand that it is only through dialogue at a negotiating table , with painful concessions on both sides , that the conflict can be definitively resolved .
Israel , Syria and the Lebanon are living through intense time in terms of national politics , as has been said this morning in this House .
We therefore need to remember the responsibility that we all have as politicians , governments and fishermen , to end the fa@@ tali@@ sm that seems to surround this sector , a responsibility that cannot of course be esca@@ ped by the Commission or its narrow view on the modernisation of the fleet .
However , what is more serious , especially serious in my view , is the lack of openness and cooperation on the part of certain Members of the Commission , who have still not provided all the documentation requested by Mr BÃ¶ge , even though we shall be voting on the matter tomorrow .
Mr President , this is a moment of transition .
These issues are of course beyond the Union &amp; apos ; s strict sphere of competence . We should tackle them together with other countries and institutions .
Secondly , with regard to the enlargement we have just carried out , we must not spare any effort when it comes to the new citizens of the Union .
But in order for those measures to be effective , we must provide them with the necessary human and financial resources .
There is , moreover , a quantified commitment to the so @-@ called called &amp; apos ; fast start &amp; apos ; . Let us hope , therefore , that the European Council will quanti@@ fy and reaffirm that commitment to help developing countries combat climate change over these next few years as well .
Commissioner , representatives of the Council , we need the budget to be an effective and credible tool which works for employment , for research , for support for small businesses and for the construction of a genuine area of justice and security .
Mr President , the report we are discussing today deals with the results of the liberalisation of the air transport sector in the European Union , which was concluded in 1993 .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , over the next few months we will be entering into a full debate on the new common agricultural policy ( CAP ) .
This double language , together with an attitude of saying or doing little in relation to the Constitution , and confusing the people with other issues which have little to do with the Constitution , does very little to promote European integration .
Perhaps its role is to prevent the establishment of a viable Palestinian state ?
You are not replying to my question , Commissioner .
The Union has committed itself to supporting democratic parliamentary elections in the autumn , in coordination with the Office for Security and Cooperation in Europe , and with the Council of Europe .
There are some countries which have made progress in achieving them and which could comply with them before the time limits set by the Commission .
We are talking about the fight against poverty .
We must be demanding and set democratic conditions that must be fulfilled .
That is what the leaders of Palestine must say clearly to their citizens : you are all necessary !
What is at issue here is the defence of the values of our European Union and respect for its laws .
Clearly , very important progress is therefore being made .
We must make a decided commitment to multilateralism and reinforce the central role of the United Nations in efforts to mediate and participate in conflict resolution .
The Commission clearly cannot ignore the fact that , when it holds commercial negotiations , its concessions have effects which sometimes turn out to be negative .
We have all had experience in recent days of the need for these mechanisms .
Mr President , I thank the Commission and the Council for their collaboration in the preparation of this report .
Particularly in terms of agriculture .
What is certainly true is that violence against women , which was originally thought of as a question of human rights , has also been recognized as a serious public health problem .
We also support the reduction in Community initiatives and would like to highlight the important role of Interreg in cross @-@ border border cooperation , which brings a truly European dimension to the initiative . In addition , its action involving the candidate countries must be strengthened .
It is therefore proposed that the Treaties be interpreted as granting and recognising the Commission &amp; quot ; s primacy and pre @-@ emin@@ ence emin@@ ence in this area , in order to provide it with instruments which may require particular action on the part of the Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , this directive and this proposal have their own personality .
In this Parliament , we have seen a great many posters in all the languages of the European Union , saying that we can put a stop to violence against women .
Nor has much progress been made in setting out precise proposals for combating unemployment , which is the scourge of the European Union and modern civilization as a whole .
We will also be committing an error if we adopt a resolution that does not acknowledge that the absence of a common position should not impede the European Union &amp; apos ; s commitment to Kosovo within the framework of a process of dialogue for stabilisation and partnership .
However , not all of them were included , and at second reading we presented only seven amendments which intended to include what had not been accepted by the other institutions .
A period of reflection on the Constitutional Treaty has been opened up and is now on the point of being concluded , and practically everybody has expressed their opinion .
There are therefore great hopes in this summit and above all the European Union has an enormous responsibility .
I should like to underline the three sets of responsibilities highlighted in Mr Medina &amp; apos ; s report .
But , quite simply , the honourable Members will have to recognise that whatever the ideological position they hold , this is a strange and extravag@@ ant idea at this time , which should not appear in the report , since it relates to other issues .
It must prepare the Union for a Europe of 27 Member States .
In fact , we are demanding compliance with the obligations before the Luxembourg Court .
Parliament proposed its exclusion and in the end we have reached an agreement which means a degree of openness with regard to pilotage .
I should be grateful to you , Commissioner , if the matter of this insurance fund could also be addressed .
Mr President , you can imagine that after five hours of debate I have no desire to add anything new , because I think everything has already been heard .
With regard to the question of Union inspectors , I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States , which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately .
In any case , any decision to revise the Multi@@ annual Financial Framework requires a Commission proposal and this proposal has not been received .
This initiative report is very timely , since it deals with a growing need within the labour market .
I therefore congratulate the Committee on Fisheries and our rapporteur .
Nevertheless , the European Parliament - above all by means of its Socialist rapporteur on the financial perspectives , Mr Colom i Naval - with the support of the Parliamentary Group of the European Socialist Party , managed to find a solution on this issue , finally adopting EUR 15 million in transfers at the close of 2002 and EUR 12 million by means of the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for 2003 .
It makes perfect sense to acknowledge digital copyright and together to address the possibility of producing a law or a measure that we can all agree on .
Mr President , I would first of all like to express my condolences and solidarity for the victims of the earthquake in Haiti .
The Spanish Presidency is to be congratulated on the work it has done in this regard .
We have had dis@@ similar , even conflic@@ tive positions , but she has found compromise solutions that allow us to stand together today on this important issue .
We must therefore deal with it .
We are therefore - I repeat - awaiting a communication from the Commission on this , once the consultation has concluded . At that point , the Council will adopt a position as soon as it has the communication from the Commission .
This our only objection to the proposal we are debating today , which is no small objective certainly , but I would like to stress that in terms of the fundamenta@@ ls of the issue we support the Commission &amp; quot ; s proposal .
What we want is for that government , as well as respecting the principles of which it is well aware , which have been proposed by the international community , also to apply the principles of law , the rule of law and democratic alter@@ nation , and to preserve the pluralistic nature of Palestinian society .
You hope to receive from the Member States in 1998 the first reports on the implementation of the regulation unifying the Member States &amp; apos ; provisions for financial control in operations co@@ financed by the Structural Funds .
They all have problems in adjusting to the great challenge which the European Union itself accepted with the GATT U@@ ruguay Round and its effects for progressively greater commercial openness at world level .
We must use all means of action on the ground , get society enthusiastically involved , and adapt to our own society &amp; apos ; s capacity for adaptation , because we must not let our welfare suffer .
Commissioner Patten will talk about this in more detail , but , in any event , you must be aware that we are prepared to continue helping to ensure that , from an economic point of view , this peace process does not have to suffer from a lack of resources from the European Union .
It would be different if we were always talking about projects of national interest .
While we are all aware that the mandate of the European Ombudsman only applies , amongst other things , to the European institutions , his office plays an important role in terms of monitoring the correct application of Community legislation .
For the moment , therefore , we continue to be relatively optimistic about developments in this field .
These delays , however , have as a rule created significant difficulties for farmers in the producing countries , some of which are among the 40 poorest countries on the planet .
It therefore has special significance for the protection and promotion of fundamental values and democracy , including social cohesion .
The new legislation must be clear and progressive .
I would just like to mention two additional elements .
It is essential that the Council push the European B@@ order Pa@@ tro@@ ls Network forward to enhance monitoring and surveillance tasks .
It is very important that , in the debate we are holding on the code of conduct , we ensure firstly that it become more restrictive and , above all , binding on every Member State .
Let me say once again , for European economic recovery , in which Spain is so honoured to take part .
I therefore think that the European Union should , as the Commissioner said , pay attention to these phenomena and increase its efforts , not only looking to the places concerned but also to the United Nations in order to deal with all aspects of the problem .
With this report , Parliament has indul@@ ged in some un@@ fruitful na@@ v@@ el @-@ ga@@ zing ga@@ zing and is throwing out all our good work .
This report was approved by a large majority in the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment , and I shall therefore stand by the result of the Committee &amp; apos ; s vote .
I believe that we will thereby have a proposal which represents a genuine step forward .
We also welcome your own announcement that other , wider @-@ ranging ranging proposals are in the pipe@@ line such as those intended to improve marketing and also the price @-@ setting setting mechanism , with a consequent increase in the de minimis regime , which , as you said , depends on the outcome of an economic impact study .
That , Mr President , is the commitment of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group which has been included amongst the political priorities for the next legislature and which provides for the creation of a European fund for compensating the victims of terrorism .
However , I must point out , like other speakers before me , that it contains legal problems that have to be tackled and I trust that these will be resolved in the dialogue between the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
Nevertheless , I believe the most important thing is that these ports are included in the trans @-@ European European transport networks , with the positive consequences that will bring .
This issue was also dealt with during the recent visit by Prime Minister Kassianov to the European Commission .
I therefore welcome this positive report on the agreement adopted by the 3@@ 6th session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) Conference , which brings to a close a long period of debate that had already led to the adoption of a number of codes of conduct .
With regard to codecision , we are not just dealing with a reform of the Council as such , but we are an interested party in the matter .
And I say this because this Parliament is going to vote tomorrow on a resolution on the mid @-@ term term review of the reform of the CAP , and that is important .
This is an issue which affects us in the Commission and Parliament , but also the national governments .
In short , we believe that the European Union must pursue its own policy in Colombia . This policy should involve genuine peace , dialogue , the elimination of poverty and prospects for sustainable development .
In December , based on the reports submitted by the Member States , the Commission will adopt the report on the first year of application of the national reform plans .
And that is absolutely the case , because of every 100 dollars spent on this peace process , 60 have been provided by the European Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , at this stage of the debate practically everything has been said .
We have a matter of the utmost importance on the table that merits this initial debate we are having today .
From the start of the consolidation initiative to the time when Parliament began its report , two directives which should theoretically have been consolidated were amended twice .
We should simplify it while respecting the existing balances of power .
What Mr Herman &amp; apos ; s report tries to do is to ensure that , whilst safeguarding the European Central Bank &amp; apos ; s autonomy , we representatives of the European peoples are informed of what is happening and can pass on our impressions to the directors of that bank .
The problem is how to harmonise the various legislation of the Member States and to seek formulas for approximation .
I believe we must make Europe a true democracy , with separation of powers , as suggested by other speakers : legislative power should reside with this Parliament , and executive power with the Commission .
In short , I can tell you that the President and the services considered that the question was addressed to Mr Prodi , and he was not expected to attend the plenary sitting .
From this perspective , unfortunately , there is nothing new in your programme .
This objective is entirely consistent with the idea of a common foreign and security policy , and it will be even more so if the constitutional treaty enters into force .
Like those carried out in other countries , experts from other Member States take part in that mission , in order to ensure the necessary degree of transparency .
We owe the success of the euro above all to our fellow citizens .
Does the Council know whether the Commission is taking any such action ?
This would be typical of the Council .
The Commission has drawn up a new proposal and I must say that , in many cases , it has not respected the guidelines that this House had approved reflecting the fundamental concern of those regions involved in olive oil production .
We understand that it is a question of an agreement at the lowest level , and in any case , we wish to make a contribution so that this report is approved tomorrow in the full session .
The President of the Commission and some secre@@ tari@@ es were present .
I hope that this desire for agreement , which took shape in December , is respected today by all our colleagues .
This principle , in which I firmly believe - and in which I hope you also believe , ladies and gentlemen - must underpin our entire approach to managing the process of achieving security in Europe .
Madam President , I asked for the floor before other Members and I wanted firstly to say that , with regard to your statement , it is not your personal position , as other Presidents have taken the same approach on previous occasions , both Mr HÃ¤nsch and I. It seems to me absolutely disgraceful that there should be a sort of police vigilance of how Members vote .
Joint and balanced action by the three European institutions - the Council , the Commission and the European Parliament - is also to be commended , Mr Brok .
Madam President , I also wish to express my best wishes to the Dutch presidency .
It therefore deserves full support in this House , I hope by a majority .
Mr President of the Council , the motion for a resolution the European Parliament is going to adopt also makes positive points which need to be taken into account .
We have been asking for this for a long time , and it is essential that in the European Union , we also have the necessary support to receive all of the people that the Obama Administration is currently asking us to receive .
At the same time we must continue to monitor the programme in order to ensure that Galileo &amp; apos ; s applications respect the strictest ethical and human rights standards .
In other words , that decision goes against the basic principles of transparency , which should govern everything relating to the European budget , and is a direct attack on the right of Europeans to know who their taxes go to .
In the last resort , each Member State is responsible for using the instrument to achieve cohesion .
The action programme seems to me to be a serious programme .
A fresh negotiating proposal is on the table . This proposal finally provides for Annex XV to be included in the Treaty of Accession , albeit only because you are unable to turn the clock back and retrieve this unfortunate situation , gentlemen .
I share Mr Schwab &amp; apos ; s concern with regard to the progress of public debt .
We Socialists believe that the time has at last come for culture and European citizens to play a decisive role in the building of Europe .
Similarly , there is no sense in the other discrimination which is made whereby it is impli@@ ed that the interests of consumers can only be defended by consumer organizations . This is totally false and incorrect .
Nevertheless , many countries have adopted these restrictive measures , countries with different economic bases such as the United States , China , Argentina , Russia and Indonesia , but also many developing countries .
The repercussions of anti @-@ terrorist terrorist measures on the Rule of Law and human rights should be assessed , above all in terms of the rights of asylum seekers and immigrants .
Mr President , I have voted against the resolution on Cuba , not because I disagree with what is said in it about the situation in Cuba , but because I disagree with what is not said .
We must make a huge educational effort to explain to the people what I have previously called &amp; apos ; the cost of not having a Constitution &amp; quot ; : why not having a Constitutional Treaty has a negative impact on their daily lives .
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively , and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present .
We are not talking about harmonising or approxi@@ mating tax rates , which will remain in the hands of the Member States .
We must also send a message to the national governments and regional and local authorities , since policies at those levels must converge and be consistent with those of the European Union .
It is a very delicate compromise and to break it would create serious problems , as Mr Watts said a moment ago .
I would like , together with the United States , the developing countries and the other countries which make up the ICAO , to agree on regulations which improve the characteristics of aircraft and bring about the modernisation of the fleets of the different countries as soon as possible .
Mr President , what we need is the political will . The Commission needs it and , above all , so does Parliament , composed as it is of the representatives of the people of Europe .
In this context , the contributions to be made today in this sitting of the European Parliament will be of fundamental importance , and I thank you for them in advance .
In fact , things are much more complex .
Given the daily practice of this Committee , these could only be concerns relating compliance with this legislation , as raised in some of the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s amendments and compromise amendments .
Mr President , Mrs WallstrÃ¶m , I am going to make a very specific proposal , since Europe needs to take courageous and imaginative measures , in order to bring European issues closer to everybody and to make progress on the creation of a European public opinion .
Europe &amp; quot ; s international role can and must be aimed at achieving a fairer and more cooperative world , without poverty or inequality , which depri@@ ves the attac@@ kers of democracy and freedom , who must always be condemned , of any justification .
Mr President , I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their contributions and say to them that I agree with all of them .
- Mr President , Mr PotoÄnik , I too would like to thank you for your comprehensive reply .
Therefore , it is very important , at the moment , that we are capable of sending a message of freedom and progress in the face of this type of defensive reaction which demonstrates that not everything has yet been consolidated .
Obviously , I had not expected the Council to reply to this letter .
We are talking here about an extremely delicate institutional balance and about regulations that are laid down in the Treaties and which have underpinned our co @-@ existence existence since 19@@ 56 .
The fact that it involves in@@ eligibility is what concerns us .
For all of these reasons , I would like to call upon the Council , the Commission and this House immediately to adopt specific measures to put an end to this unacceptable situation .
Should we not be more ambitious ?
Mr President , the Presidency @-@ in in @-@ Office Office is pleased with the debate generated . In addition , the Presidency is grateful for Parliament &amp; apos ; s un@@ failing encouragement and would like to acknowledge publicly the support and inspiration this House has always offered .
Do you think we should now move on to adopt more hard @-@ hitting hitting measures or do you instead consider that a sof@@ tly @-@ sof@@ tly sof@@ tly approach is the best way of negotiating with the Iranian regime ?
I believe that this is the third time , at least , that a Commission has said that that is what is going to happen .
We need political will , but - and I reiterate the words of the chairman of my committee - we also need new procedures that will enable us to fulfil the citizens &amp; apos ; demands .
We are thus acting macro@@ economically in the areas where we and the Central Bank have competence , and we are also acting micro@@ economically .
It must be remembered that France already envisaged such constitutional treatment when the first European Union Treaties were signed - the Treaty of Rome 19@@ 57 - since there is a specific reference to the French overseas territories .
Any response to the historic challenge of enlargement of the European Union towards Eastern Europe and Cyprus requires the Union to look closely at and to increase its own capacity to respond to citizens &amp; apos ; everyday problems .
A significant proportion of Amendments Nos 25 and 33 would unnecessarily restrict the rights of passengers and we therefore reject them .
The principle of subsidiarity will be respected as well .
Therefore , Mr Sainjon , I believe that the approach taken by the European Commission is entirely in line with the report adopted by Parliament in 1994 .
We also need to make sure that there are no delays in payments , because many beneficiaries cannot cope with such delays .
Since then , world aeronautical technology has made great advances .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , I would first like to tell the rapporteur , Mrs Schroedter , that she has produced a good report on Agenda 2000 .
Of course , I also think that better incorporation of the experience and expertise of fis@@ hers into the process of drawing up scientific opinions , on which political decisions as part of the CFP are to be based , is vital .
As a result , commitment to the correction of inequalities at source , by reinforcing development cooperation , is the first point .
Mr President , this is indeed a point of order .
We cannot conce@@ al our reticence over emissions trading and its monitoring or the use of sin@@ ks .
As Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez has said , this is not an issue which is easily resolved , but I believe we could do something from here on many levels .
In this respect , I think that the report defends and sets out the progress that has been made .
Mr President , until this current parliamentary term , the standing committees , the interparliamentary delegations and the delegations of the joint parliamentary committees of this House were set up using a uniform procedure : Plenary , at the proposal of the Conference of Presidents , appointed Members , and these , at the inaugural meeting , elected the bu@@ reau for each of these bodies .
As regards China , the Council determined a certain number of reference criteria for the human rights dialogue in 2001 .
D@@ ata protection in the Framework Decision in the third pillar as soon as possible is important to us .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by congratulating Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner Waldner .
But there is one aspect included in the wonderful report by Mr Luis Que@@ irÃ³ that I would like to stress .
However , these words should have a docu@@ mental and informa@@ tive component , with full knowledge of the facts , and frankly , I have been very surprised to hear certain statements that suggest otherwise .
If we had concentrated on that , perhaps we should have achieved a better result and practically full support for the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals .
The report therefore seems to me to be opportune and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the content .
When the Member States dis@@ cover concern amongst the citizens - about growth or about employment - they launch the Lisbon Strategy and tell the European Commission to look for the funding .
In this regard , I am happy to tell you that the majority of those intended to clarify the text of the proposed Decision can be accepted by the Commission .
Furthermore , Mr President , this European Union project is not just a matter of a political , economic and military union .
Mr President , I would have liked this proposal from Mr E@@ li@@ as@@ son to have been adopted by consensus , but in the end it has been put to a vote .
We are also opposed to any discrimination in accepting new members . For that reason , we think it is a good idea to offer them all a range of possibilities .
Finally , Madam President , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , I would like to thank Commissioner Mandelson and Commissioner Fischer Bo@@ el and their teams of negotiators for the efforts they have made and the attention they have paid to us .
The Council and the Commission considered that such commitments from the German and Portuguese Governments responded to the basis of the concerns expressed in the Commission &amp; apos ; s recommendations for which they would be fore@@ warned .
What is more - and here we are focusing on the content of the proposal - , it is no use giving a general description of a uniform format for visas at European level so that , ultimately , Member States can decide on the technical procedures they wish to use .
We were asked to surrender the prerogatives that should be the privileges , the basic rules , of any European Parliament .
The possible application by legal authorities of the criterion of using as many legislations as countries affected may complicate actions for damages , hinder legal action and weaken competition .
Secondly , European Union aid should be used to put an end to para@@ militar@@ ism , which entails going far beyond simple disarmament , and going on to tackle the political and social elements underlying that para@@ militar@@ ism .
The Commission is drafting a report on the subject for the forthcoming European Council at Ghent on 19 October .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are meeting here in this House to debate the political priorities proposed by the Commission for 2005 and to assess the results of our structured dialogue : a which has now been operating for three years and which has had some positive results , which has made our actions more coherent and effective and interinstitutional cooperation more positive and which has ensured that the European Commission &amp; quot ; s right to initiative , which is one of its prerogatives , is not inconsistent with listening to the demands and sensitivities of this Parliament .
Nevertheless I should like to comment on industrial policy and consultation of the workforce on the basis of this morning &amp; apos ; s debate which he attended .
I am convinced that the guarantees that Baroness Ashton gave in her declaration are satisfactory from the point of view of political responsibility , and are in line with the prerogatives that the treaty as@@ signs to Parliament as part of the information , consultation and partnership process .
This is also positive because parliamentary scrutiny is taken into account in these deadlines and decisions .
To ensure that it has its desired effect , it is essential that the European Union &amp; apos ; s cooperation with the countries involved in the MEDA programme is based on total respect for democratic liberties and human rights .
We advocate the adoption of preventive measures in all European Union countries to prohibit camp@@ sites being set up in at @-@ risk risk areas and that those already in existence be inspec@@ ted in order to prevent a repetition of this type of accident .
Personally I hope so , but for the moment let us be content with respecting the law that is in force .
We have to be much stricter in everything we do within and beyond the European Union , and this is something that I would like to stress in particular .
Mr President , I was in my office when I was made to leave by officials of this Parliament who told me that there was a fire dri@@ ll .
That is what we wish to rectify .
I believe that this dialogue between modes of transport is essential , as is the cross @-@ border border one between road systems , which can also encourage other aspects of road safety .
Finally , have these programmes allowed for the current tendency towards a reduction in the consumption of natural gas , evident in many Member States of the European Union ?
Therefore , the rapporteur cannot support those amendments which would represent profound structural changes to the institutional architecture of the Union .
On the other hand , it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament , which were minimal anyway .
My reply will be very quick .
I think Mr Posselt is talking about defending human rights , and as far as human rights are concerned , there are certain attitudes in Cuba which do not respect them adequately .
I personally support this measure unreservedly ; and the fine @-@ tuning tuning which has been introduced by means of amendments in this Parliament are simply a demonstration of a desire that this power be used prudently , as I am sure the Commission is going to do .
Perhaps also Amendments Nos 63 , 6@@ 6.@@ 2 , 7@@ 3.@@ 1 , 7@@ 4@@ .2 , the final part of 75 , and 7@@ 8@@ .2 .
If we study recent events in Colombia , we generally see a discoura@@ ging and tragic picture , in which the human rights situation leaves much to be desired .
These amendments address aspects not covered in the joint resolution , and we thought it would be appropriate to include them . I am going to defend them even though I do not have much time .
A few weeks ago some EU Member States in the United Nations debated the common EU position on the Sahara .
Mr President , it is an honour for me to appear here before you in order to explain the main priorities of the Spanish rotating Presidency over the next six months .
Indeed , this became a critical issue just over a year ago , with the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine .
Mr President , Commissioner , I must first congratulate the general rapporteur , Mrs Haug , the President of the Commission and my colleagues who have been involved in negotiations on the excellent work that they have done .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are faced with a broader problem , that of the organisation of work characterised by the use of workers provided by temporary work agencies , the dividing up of the productive process , allocating it to contr@@ actors , sub@@ contr@@ actors and self @-@ employed employed workers and extern@@ alised and decentralised production methods in general .
Do not , then , however , subsidis@@ e your agriculture .
Mr President , I know that the world is often cruel and that , of course , neither Europe nor the Council can solve all of its problems or shoulder all of its tragedies .
There is a proposal here that both the Commission and Parliament agree upon , which is to organise a debate in three stages , using a working method inspired by the convention , to culmin@@ ate in a short , decisive conference .
In its present wording , article 10 is , in my view , legally incorrect .
On the area of political dialogue and will , because - let us make no mistake - it is political will which has driven these relations forward over recent years , and we are therefore proposing the creation of a Euro @-@ Latin Latin American parliamentary assembly , somewhat similar to the Assembly which has been established in the field of Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean relations .
What we are detec@@ ting at the moment is that there is no control mechanism for activities crossing national borders .
In order for the elections to really unblock the current situation , we first need to create the conditions for those elections to be held in a climate of civil peace and reconciliation .
Today we are improving democracy , bringing decision @-@ making making processes closer to citizens and making them more open and deliber@@ ative , always looking towards people .
This must be done by promoting the active participation of the populations which depend on the forests and the local communities in the creation of policies and planning in the field of development .
In this way , for ongoing , unfinished cases a balance is struck regarding the aforementioned assumption on non @-@ dis@@ closure dis@@ closure .
My group also supports the amendments in the report by Mr PiÃ©trasanta , whom I congratulate on his very thorough work , including the Latin corrections .
We must take account of the economic cycle , preserve equality of treatment for each and every country - and this is a task the Commission identifies itself with in particular - and ensure better compliance .
Parliament is moving ahead without looking at matters carefully , and I feel that the very fact that this resolution has been adopted unanimously in the Committee on Development is highly significant .
Member of the Commission . Sweden is currently one of the eleven Member States with derogations in relation to adopting the single currency .
Nevertheless , we feel that a strong and well @-@ financed financed European budget is a valuable and essential tool for restar@@ ting the EU economy .
We call on the Member States to ratify this convention so that we can be more consistent and effective in dealing with this issue that affects us all .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for all his work and , above all , for his great willingness to seek solutions to possible problems .
Finally , I should like to keep up this sense of urgency in our work without res@@ ting on our laurels .
Mr President , in general terms , we agree with the rapporteur , Mrs Thors , in supporting the initiative of the Ombudsman to obtain greater transparency as regards all Community activities and to urge all of the institutions to provide information related to their field of activity to the citizens or legal persons who reside or have their home in any Member State and who ask for such information .
However , Commissioner , the problem is that we are dealing with a major problem , which I regret very much was not even mentioned in your speech .
The European Union is the main international player .
Many issues have been mentioned , all of them extremely problematic : China , Tunisia , Zimbabwe and Turkey .
The Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party will vote against some of the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &amp; apos ; Rights on the issue of liability , particularly Amendments Nos 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 and 50 to 54 . We will vote against them as we feel they upset this balance .
The depor@@ tation of 8 million people with no sort of guarantee : a disgr@@ ace !
The problem is poverty throughout a large part of the world .
I would like to know whether the Commission is taking action or intends to take action to make sure that the loss of products is compensated for . But I see that this is a question that does not interest the Commission .
Whether or not they have found that protection in their national government is a matter for the Spanish Parliament .
Since then , since the new Commission took office , both you and your colleagues and the Commissioner for Trade have sought to reach an agreement .
This was mentioned by Mrs Car@@ don@@ a , among others . However , I must admit that I totally disagree with the idea that the Commission should merely play an implementing role .
We must state very loudly that establishing the maximum possible harmonisation across the Member States would reduce the protection of many consumers , since in many countries there is a greater tradition of protecting consumer rights .
With regard to the prevention of this and other diseases we should consider the repercussions of the quest for competitiveness , resulting from a reduction in aid from the CAP .
I call on you , and all those interested in this matter , to take the appropriate steps to take this to the Commission .
We shall never be able to compete with the star@@ v@@ ation wages and union rights of the countries of the third world and Eastern Europe .
It is also necessary to increase the participation of women in decision @-@ making making processes , and therefore a recommendation from the Commission to the relevant bodies so that they take the necessary action in this regard would be very positive .
If we take that approach , then legitimacy and democratic scrutiny will be missing .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President President of the European Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for this report , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , for having accepted the majority of the amendments which this Committee has proposed in its opinion .
However , it is important that we encourage the Commission , and we should do so with some urgency , to put all its mechanisms into operation .
We will have to see what solutions are possible and we will also have to see how Europe can show solidarity , and I sure there will be no lack of it .
Your staff and you yourself have always given us inestimable support .
The solution would be to have national statements .
One may ask how the amendments will be financed .
This is why we have to work on all areas , increasing , as best we can , our cooperation with Russia in the economic and commer@@ ci@@ als spheres .
Finally , I would like to end as I began , by thanking you and President Cox for the work that you have done during the Spanish Presidency .
You have also said something very important : that Europe is not in crisis .
On Monday , as you all know , a summit will take place here , in Brussels , at which all of these issues will doubtless be addressed with President Putin .
Specifically , the intention is to develop common harmonised procedures for all aid programmes .
I could carry on giving examples , but those will suffice .
The Member States must deal with the possible negative effects of this directive by making it easier for companies to employ young women by exemp@@ ting them from the social costs during parental leave .
The Commission is taking a balanced approach ; we act here jointly and with solidarity , and we are in a very serious situation .
Therefore , the Commission considers that this second paragraph of Article 299 of the Treaty is the appropriate legal basis for these proposals and any others which may arise in the future .
It would be difficult , you understand , for me to respond to the representative of the Council if he did not have the opportunity to speak first .
Madam President , the European Commission has presented this amendment to the single C@@ M@@ O Regulation , saying that this will now include wine in a new presentation that supposedly tries to avoid pa@@ per@@ work and red tape .
We therefore believe that the question is relevant and continues to be relevant due to the importance of the topic .
It must be made very clear to the public that Parliament &amp; apos ; s power to put forward amendments is limited only by the Treaty itself . And even the Treaty is an open one , since it includes an open @-@ ended ended article - Article 2@@ 35 - which allows the Council to extend its powers should that prove necessary , when requested by the Commission and supported by Parliament .
In my view , Mr President , nonsense is an unduly pe@@ jor@@ ative word to use .
Amongst our contributions which have been accepted by the rapporteur , I would like to highlight the texts which aim to prevent problems of confusion of interests , a recurrent issue in the management of some programmes , and , in voting on the Fabra VallÃ©s report , less than an hour ago we encountered the problems deriving from insufficient regulation .
It should also be pointed out that the Lisbon and Feira Summits have reiterated the need to move ahead with liberali@@ sations .
Mr President , we have two problems : energy supply and emissions .
Nevertheless , neither can the Commission accept Amendments Nos 9 to 12 , which do not intend to exclude , but rather to include in Annex I@@ I@@ a , four benefits laid down in Swedish legislation , since they are family benefits and are therefore expor@@ table .
In addition , if the treaty were applied to the letter it would not be in line with the reality of present day budgets .
It is urgent that we carry out a reform in order to introduce new mechanisms , mechanisms for managing the market in order to deal with the difficulties being faced by certain parts of the sector and which will be accentu@@ ated following the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation .
Secondly , the amendments should not alter or block the MEDA Programme .
On the other hand , the Union &amp; apos ; s national data protection authorities now have their hands tied because , if passengers complain , they must apply the European directives in force and are obliged to impose penalties on the airlines .
I believe these advances will also be helped by our proposals to introduce more competition into sea@@ ports and more safety in the maritime sector ( remember all last year &amp; apos ; s work on the Erika I and Erika II packages ) , simplifying administrative procedures , and a series of other future measures aimed at facilitating coastal or maritime transport in general , as well as inland waterway transport .
Mr President , sport is not just about performance , competitions and eli@@ te sportspeople ; it is also about developing a sense of community and a common purpose ; it is about humanity itself .
I trust in this Parliament &amp; apos ; s determination to move the Erika II package forward with the three new measures that complement those we are debating today , and I agree that the Council too must hurry up and support Parliament .
We must bring Europe closer to the citizens and if there is one place where our citizens can see that Europe exists , it is in the border regions .
This means that we have the opportunity to replace the current pat@@ ch@@ work of restrictions with prepared measures within a coherent framework of analysis , in such a way that similar solutions will be applied in European airports which have similar problems .
Of course , our objective is the same as yours : to implement aid as soon as possible , to pay it as quickly as possible and in this respect we are going to continue working with Parliament in complete harmony .
There is absolutely no doubt that one of the conclusions that can be drawn from the referendums in France and Hol@@ land is that the citizens do not want to be treated as mere passive spectators , but as dynamic players in the process of European integration , who want more transparency and more means for participation .
For that reason , if spon@@ tane@@ ous harmonization of these rules could be produced , which have been shown , day after day , to be completely different in the Member States , this task of setting rules and regulations - that is community competition - would not need to be carried out .
Having a European vision requires common criteria and absolute transparency in the pre @-@ selection selection process by the Member States . It also means that we must respect regional , cultural and linguistic diversity .
The adopted amendments affecting those articles are the following : 10@@ 2 , 103 , 104 , 105 , 10@@ 6 , 10@@ 7 , 108 , 109 , 110 and 135 .
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces .
Firstly , I would like to point out that it is precisely the energy sector which has been the first to draw up a communication on environmental integration in its policy .
Mr President , I am here on behalf of the Presidency @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council to inform Parliament of the results of the summit between the European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean countries held in Madrid on 17 and 18 May .
But I would like this to come about , not because a rule imposes it , but because the equal distribution of capacities between men and women is reflected in our social and political practices .
The issues are very complicated , very sensitive and , as Mrs Hal@@ on@@ en said , very different political cultures will be dealing with the same phenomenon , but it is good that this process has been started .
The situation in terms of the issue we are debating is as follows : the Council has repeatedly discussed these initiatives , both in the Energy Council and in the Ecofin Council .
For all of these reasons , there is broad consensus amongst health experts and bodies about the possibility that the A virus H@@ 5 may adapt to human transmission and create a new pandemic .
Another paragraph that some wish to remove concerns professional secrecy and says that professional secrecy must be subordinated to the efficiency of dangerous product surveillance and follow @-@ up up services .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to suggest mandatory targets but we have to be realistic and , although I regret this , I cannot , at this time , accept this suggestion that you have made , because it would be automatically rejected by the Member States .
Nobody , therefore , can stop the Council from adopting internal rules , provided these rules conform to the terms of the Treaties .
I wanted to link these two problems by pointing out that the outermost regions , although they are far from the Community &amp; apos ; s continental territory , are in fact part of our territory and that it is currently necessary to control illegal immigration into these regions .
While there are improvements in productivity , those improvements must be reflected in the development of wages .
The honourable Members know all of these measures presented by the Commission - many of them during the French Presidency - which were also debated in part and which formed part of our analysis of the White Paper .
I believe that all the speakers are very concerned about the results of the Nice European Council .
Why not allocate the competences for development in the developing countries to the Commissioner with responsibility for that area ?
We are talking about EUR 30 million - 15 for this year and 15 for next year .
However , there can be no doubt that the European Union should always be inspired by the desire to keep alive the fla@@ me of the fight for its basic principles and the defence of these , which I described in my opening speech .
This is the minimum we can ask for in order that the fishermen affected accept and comply with the plans laid down - whether they take place in Community or non @-@ Community Community waters - whenever they affect European fleets , as in the recent case of the proposed recovery plan for ha@@ li@@ but in NAFO waters .
I hope this House will soon be able to celebrate a peace agreement for the Basque people , and I hope the European institutions will offer sincere support in this matter .
Unless there are final agreements between the Council , the Commission and Parliament , I am afraid that the only thing we are doing is promoting euro@@ scepticism .
The appropriate instrument already exists for dealing with amendments concerning freedom of movement for workers , an issue which is of such concern to us all .
Nevertheless , and despite the great precedent being set within the Union , I would like to stress the need for the European Parliament to be kept constantly informed of the content and the timetable of the negotiation and also for the views of civil society to be taken into account .
This leads us to call for the harmonisation of VAT and for it to be applied at source , as Mr PÃ©rez Ro@@ yo suggested , but , until this happens , it is clear that these price differences will encourage fraud .
Respect for and promotion of equality between men and women are part of the Community acquis and are therefore an essential condition for the new countries of the European Union .
Therefore , the representation of the State essentially takes place by means of internal cooperation and each State can , within this context , represent the interests of the territorial regions of its territory in the way that best suits the general interests of the whole country .
As the President of the rotating Presidency , I have expressed , declared and supported the institutional role of the permanent President of the Council , of course , the High Representative , and the full collaboration of the Commission , and I will continue to do so .
However , with regard to immigration and asylum , I must say that the Council &amp; apos ; s text adopts a tone of renunciation which worries me .
As regards the relationship between taxation and social security , this is an issue which essentially falls within the competence of the Member States and not the Union .
The ambition for a new strategy appears to be paralysed and stran@@ gely this coincides with the enlargement of the Union .
We are therefore going to ask for more detail in the plans which are submitted , in the structure of expenditure and also of income , paying particular attention to investments .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to highlight that the amendments presented by the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms have been accepted by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy and , in particular , the demand in Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights for good administration and access to the texts of the institutions ( this corresponds to Amendment No 1 of the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms ) .
Mr President , in total , 10 amendments were approved by a substantial majority in this House and then not accepted by the Council , and we therefore had to embark on this conciliation procedure , which I must point out has been neither difficult nor controversial .
Mrs Prets , Chris@@ ta , I would ask you please to help me , because I know from Mr Corbett &amp; apos ; s speech that your party is going to vote against the application of Article 308 .
Furthermore , the question is raised of the possible use or limitations of the legislative procedure .
The European Parliament draws up laws and directives and therefore its relationship with the UN must be one of respect and support .
Secondly , the Union cannot allow itself the luxury of failing to expand , and will have to make allow@@ ance in its costs for those of non @-@ enlargement enlargement , if we want to have a true balance .
D@@ ata collection is extremely welcome , but it must be based on reliable information .
As far as the most significant addi@@ tions to the proposal are concerned , I welcome the ex ante controls on public broad@@ cas@@ ters &amp; apos ; provision of new services , but only if enough flexibility is retained for these controls to be adjusted to the institutional model of each State and adopted gradually .
As I said before , a parliamentary committee is not a court of justice , but it can draw conclusions from a legislative point of view .
The first was very simple : has the Dutch presidency scheduled for the informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council in April an initial assessment of the revision of the financial perspectives , with a view to the financing of the European Union in the post @-@ 1999 1999 period ?
With regard to its importance , it is perhaps not one of the most important , but it is a useful agreement , both for the European Union and for Angola , as Mrs Fraga has highlighted .
Nevertheless , widening must be accompanied by deepening - in order to prevent the European Union from becoming a mere free @-@ trade trade area - and progress towards political union , with the introduction of the essential institutional reforms .
As the honourable Members will imagine , we are working in close cooperation with all the countries of the region in order to try to ensure that the opportunity offered by the Roadmap leads to a good result .
Despite the doubts that remained up until the last moment , we were able to adopt a final text on 27 January , almost two months before this important international meeting .
It was at the latest meeting last week that , in a still timid , but firm , manner , the recovery of European transport , logistics and infrastructures were raised as crucial policies if the European economy is to meet the challenges of globalisation with guarantees .
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations , but complemen@@ ting them , never obstruc@@ ting or excluding them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs .
I would like to say that Parliament , as it did before the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam , has opted for a line which consists of a short and precise list dealing with fundamental issues .
Mr President , I have been mentioned , and a value judgment has been made against me .
Nevertheless , it had to reject the Commission &amp; apos ; s initial proposals when , supposedly for the sake of greater efficiency , it came to restricting the House &amp; apos ; s role , that is to say , to restricting democracy .
The reason for this is simple : public service broadcasting provides a service to society in many areas which cannot be totally funded by the market .
I cannot see the Commissioner here , which is very strange because he always comes to debates on foreign policy when he can .
One important aspect , which I would like to refer to , is that of funding .
Thirdly , we have seen once again how difficult it is to reach a consensus .
Community competition is an exclusive competence of the European Union .
Some of us have been working to reach agreements , to bring positions closer together , in order to achieve what in the end has become a reality .
What I can assure you of is that the Commission is keen , and that is why we are carrying out a study . There is no need to wait for the study to be finished before it is made known to Parliament .
I believe that the compromise which has finally been achieved , three years for transposition into national legislations , plus another three to make its full application obligatory , is reasonable .
I think citizens in all our countries feel security is threatened , and - I think this is enormously positive - they feel that Europe should also take responsibility for this area which so closely affects their lives .
There has also been a certain care@@ lessness , of which I am sure the Commissioner will take note , so that we will , as soon as possible , achieve the aim of this reform which we began with the van Hulten report .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , first of all , I would like to welcome you to this House .
The industry rejects them outright .
To that end the European Neighbourhood Policy should also tackle the basic issue of communication and visibility .
There is an exhaustive study by the Commission , but it dates from 1999 .
Such a peace is already being achieved in Northern Ireland , following the end of terrorism and the political dialogue champi@@ oned by our colleague and recent Nobel prize @-@ winner winner John Hume .
It is true that this has not been a discretionary policy , but we believe that the Pact has been as important - in relative terms and given the importance of automatic stabilisers - in Europe , as certain discretionary policies may have been in the United States .
I would like to stress the support of the European Con@@ feder@@ ation of Trade Uni@@ ons for the European Constitution , which I believe to be truly essential and fundamental .
Within this framework , we must not forget that cooperatives are groups of people or legal entities in which people , the personal dimension , are paramount , and must always be - and in fact are - very present .
We have tried to prevent a healthy , specific political objective from being mis@@ interpreted and misused .
Therefore , that first small reform , in which we only had to consider the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council and to which the Cologne Declaration has also added the possible extension of qualified majority voting , does not make much sense and responds to a different political logic .
From the Spanish experience , which has been mentioned a few times , I believe that Parliament &amp; apos ; s amendments improve on the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal because it introduces moderation - strict moderation - into the pace of opening up and liberalisation .
Those in favour of unanimity are merely showing that they are aware of the fact that , through hard work , 15 Member States reached a pact in Amsterdam that states that , for five years , decisions in this area must be taken unanimously .
Mr President , the Committee on Petitions is one of the European Union &amp; apos ; s bodies that brings us closest to European citizens .
They are amendments which refer to the possibility of an external certification of safe products , to the possibility of harmonising the monitoring programmes of the different Member States , to the inclusion of the precautionary principle in such an important issue and to the establishment and promotion of a network of competent authorities in relation to product safety .
Madam President , I wish to reiterate my thanks to all my fellow Members for their speeches and for this debate which has been a very positive one indeed .
What we are now seeing is that the economies that are not well prepared to deal with a crisis such as this are suffering the most , both within and outside the euro area .
Russia , with all its advantages and with all its disadvantages , is a great country , with which we share a common area : the great European plain .
In this respect , I hope that we will be able to ensure that economic development is accompanied by social development and , in particular , to influence the development of the social economy . I also hope that we will be able to fulfil the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by 20 million .
The President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , the Danish Prime Minister , Mr R@@ as@@ mus@@ en , when he was kind enough to invite us to the Conference of Presidents in Copenhagen , spoke of the three stages of the Danish Presidency .
Secondly , negotiation . As Mr Obiols pointed out , negotiation is an unquestionable weapon for moving forward in that process and for advancing internal reforms in Turkey .
To that end , it is important that the supervisory authority , which you have mentioned , also send its reports to Parliament and that the expert appointed by Parliament has the status of observer in the authority &amp; quot ; s activities .
The most important aspect of my report is the political message to citizens .
I would go as far as to say today that the principal gap in the European Union &amp; apos ; s anti @-@ terrorist terrorist policy is not the lack of measures and initiatives , but the fact that we do not acknowledge sufficiently that terrorism is the main problem facing Europeans .
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data .
We do not need a Europe with divergent objectives , but a Europe with a common objective , albeit with various speeds .
I would say rather that it means that the policy is not only successful for the cohesion countries , for the poorest regions which are receiving significant aid , but also for other regions , in the wealthy countries , which do not receive the aid .
The rapporteur takes a positive view of the Council &amp; quot ; s consultation of Parliament within a procedure in which codecision is not yet applied .
I would like to say to the honourable Members that of course I share your concern , but that there are legal institutional obstacles which prevent us from accepting some of the amendments you have presented , such as , for example , in the case of the report by Mr Fava , Amendments Nos 1 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 and 14 and , in the case of the report by Mrs Sanders @-@ ten ten Holte , Amendments Nos 13 , 16 , 25 , 29 and 33 .
But we have also democra@@ tised the Union , starting with the first article of the Constitution , which speaks of the Union &amp; apos ; s double legitimacy , something which this Parliament has always advocated as a Union of states and citizens .
Mr President , the direct cultural policy of the European Union is restricted , as the Member States have wished , to the modest funding of programmes which , nevertheless , are amongst those most often requested by the citizens .
Furthermore , other amendments do not present any problems of principle .
I would like to add something else .
I should also like to say that last December the Vienna European Council dealt with sport from two points of view .
The situation was very different initially , since we were working on the basis of differing situations in each of the Member States .
This attack has helped to strengthen the Commission and the Council and the measures which we have announced in response have had the full backing of European public opinion .
I would like to place the report within its context and point out that we are talking about establishing the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s position in relation to the Commission &amp; apos ; s Green Paper on the European financial prosecutor .
This is a worrying matter for many modest families , for example in the Spanish provin@@ ces of Gran@@ ada and CÃ¡@@ ce@@ res , we are waiting for the decisions to be taken by the European institutions .
What can be done in this situation ?
I think that , once again , the conciliation procedure , which means agreement between the institutions , is working properly .
Secondly , following our contacts during the tripartite dialogue , we have reached an agreement amongst the co @-@ legislators legislators on the basis of an interinstitutional declaration and a Commission declaration on control and transparency in the management of those funds .
We must be able not just to take measures , but also to ensure that European citizens know and understand what we are doing .
However , it is the case that 50 % , or perhaps a little more , of delays are due to problems in the management of air traffic .
Obviously , that is a very important event in the United Kingdom , but it is probably of less interest in Spain or Greece .
For the first time we have experienced Europe , Europe at its most fruitful , improving national health systems , because obviously data collection is the starting point for better information enabling Member States to improve their respective health systems , something which seems to have caused offence to certain members of the Council .
We hope that the measures for combating the funding of terrorism in Europe can also be applied soon .
We welcome the effort to maintain the share for the cohesion policy , and also the strengthening of the Union &amp; apos ; s social policies , growth and employment policies and also justice and foreign policies .
As regards financing , we must find instruments appropriate to the European Space Policy which , in addition to that specified in the Seventh Framework Programme , will enable medium- and long @-@ term term planning .
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be rega@@ ined ?
We want and we demand institutions close to the people and responsible to them , European institutions where information , discussion before decisions are taken , and subsequent evaluation of the results of the policies are possible .
The government is responsible for extending and strengthening the rule of law and for protecting those who are fighting for dignity and democratic principles .
I clearly cannot blame you for this , since you have just taken over the Presidency , but I would ask you to adopt much more energetic and forceful decisions .
Given the Council &amp; apos ; s draft budget we can only think that , if there are plans to reduce these Structural Funds at the very moment when the regions most need extra help in the process of applying the convergence criteria , this is due to the fact that it is ta@@ ci@@ tly renouncing the policy of economic and social cohesion and turning it merely into an instrument of the States &amp; apos ; whim , and my Group is against such a blin@@ ke@@ red policy .
I think it would be better to tackle it Treaty in hand and adopt , with the correct legal basis , measures appropriate to the objective being sought .
