Today , it is undisputed claims that we are discussing , and that is why this first step is so important .
I too would have thought that guidelines would have been quite adequate .
It was , &apos; this is better than nothing . &quot;
The aim of the study is to analyse the present situation and to develop political options with a view to plu@@ gging gaps , if necessary by amending the current legal provisions .
I would ask you to observe a minute &apos; s silence in memory of Lord Be@@ th@@ ell and all victims of terrorism .
Mr President , we are indeed the largest market , and we are by far the largest importers of products from the developing countries .
That is why , last Monday , we also again made clear that the money for maintaining this mission is slowly running out and the European Union will then of course have to support the African action financially beyond that time .
That has to be made clear and - as you , Commissioner Verheugen , know better than any of us - those things that were neglected when negotiating Agenda 2000 cannot now be put right again a quarter of a year before Copenhagen .
I should like to remind you all of the dreadful Conciliation Committee mar@@ ath@@ on over the little bit extra we wanted for Socrates .
We are more than prepared to do so but certain framework conditions have to be complied with .
The first are social problems ; in other words , Mexico will certainly have to review its social policy because trade policies alone will not solve social problems .
We are very much in favour of the citizens of Europe having the freedom to decide , but , that being the case , let us be quite clear about what we mean by the principle of subsidiarity .
Madam President , when arch@@ a@@ e@@ olog@@ ists com@@ b the countryside today and find the bones of pre@@ historic d@@ inosau@@ rs , they are delighted and can prepare and exhi@@ bit these finds in perfect safety . I do not believe that it is quite so simple with the energy d@@ inosau@@ rs of today .
It depi@@ cts UNI@@ TA as the only vil@@ la@@ ins of the piece .
I believe that we will also find supporters .
Amendment No 3 - this is really an old story - concerns the renewal of a Protocol .
I think that because of this st@@ om@@ ach a@@ che I would very gladly vote for this compromise , because , just like all of you , I am in favour of this internal market , and I would have been happi@@ er if it had already been established now , not at some point in the near future .
I should like to mention a number of economic criteria , such as the high rate of inflation which was over 100 % and which is still over 50 % , the high national debt as the result of the strain on the national budget from military expenditure and the military conflict with the PKK , high real interest rates , the continuing predomin@@ ance of the public sector , huge regional differences in Turkey , a prosperity differ@@ ential within Turkey of 1 : 10 , which the European Union will never be able to bring under control , different educational qualifications , illi@@ ter@@ acy , which still affects 2@@ 7.@@ 6 % of women , i.e. problems which Turkey itself must resolve .
I should like to thank Mrs Est@@ ev@@ an Bo@@ le@@ a most sincerely for her report which points out very clearly how important production is in this area , as well as use in power stations for heating .
First of all , I have something to ask the Commissioner : given that the old directive , the existing anti @-@ discrimination directive , has still not been transposed in ten of the Member States - given that infringement proceedings are underway against ten Member States - we seriously have to ask ourselves why we need to revise this directive when the old one has not even been transposed yet .
We must do everything in our power to fight international terrorism .
One important cornerstone - and quite rightly so - is that it covers not just spouses , but also life partners .
When it comes to the vote at midday today , we shall have to respect a number of other limits .
In 2007 , there will be three more directives that have gone through the Lamfalussy procedure : the directive on responsibilities in relation to prospec@@ t@@ uses , the Market Ab@@ use Directive and the one on financial conglomerates .
The directive before us today establishes a good middle way that regulates the issues relating to the internal market , while leaving legislative decisions on all other matters to the Member States themselves .
We should also ensure that savings are made .
Against this background , we welcome the fact that the ECB has put forward a proposal unanimously .
I would also like to reiterate that we would thus be able to comply with the Kyoto protocol all the more speedily , and would remind you of the impetus this would give to rural areas and to the multifunctional role of agriculture .
Let us bring greater depth and breadth to Europe , to enable us to meet our citizens &apos; expectations .
We need unified , transparent data collection standards .
That help , unfortunately , must be forced through against the will of the gener@@ als , come what may .
However , I believe that in one respect there is consensus : the pace of reform in Turkey seems to have sla@@ ck@@ ened ; the impression at the end of this legislative period is that Turkey now has further to go before it will be ready for accession than it had at the beginning both of the mandate of the Commission and of the legislature of this Parliament .
We would have like to have achieved even more , especially as regards costs .
For us there are therefore always two options when we enter a discharge procedure .
My second comment has to do with the Bonn conference ; I would like to suggest that we in this House should also send a delegation to represent us at it , as a whole array of legislat@@ ures from around the world will be doing .
I mention that as just one small example .
The Presidency has put an initial exchange of views between Ministers concerning the Commission communication on the agenda for the Council to be held on 7 June of this year .
I also rejo@@ i@@ ced to hear that you had , in your speech in Singapore on 29 April , revi@@ ved an old initiative of this House , that being the demand for closer cooperation between Europe and Asia .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , budgetary policy always requires fore@@ sight , and today we are discussing Budget 2001 , the budget for next year , and so together we must decide what demands there will be on European policy and the European budget next year , which we will need to fulfil , and what challenges we will face there .
It is very important , therefore , that the responsible Commissioner give a clear direction .
To close , allow me to express my thanks to the Czech Presidency , the Commission , the members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and the Committee on Transport and Tourism and , above all , their chairmen and rapporteurs , who all worked intensively on these important legislative acts .
At the same time , we know that demographic developments will only intensify the problem .
Let us not beat about the bus@@ h - Parliament is lagging somewhat behind the Commission when it comes to implementing gender mainstreaming internally .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner Kinnock , I am glad that you have been able to get back to your roots as transport commissioner by delivering your speech to us just in time .
We need a summit that makes it clear at what European Union level we can regulate everything best , so that we really can make progress in using the single market in the interests not just of the economy but also of the people , of the workers .
In its current form , the adopted text further reduces the minimum level of protection provided under the 1998 directive on bio @-@ patents .
Wh@@ ichever of the two may be the case , we say a firm &apos; no &quot; to it .
If other important practical , national and regional concerns have been dealt with in addition to this , the matter is a really coherent one .
On the other hand , it does not actually make any sense - we are not in any trouble - to curtail the parliamentary procedure , because I think that in the USA they will recognise that parliamentary procedures take time .
My own amendments are designed to make the draft somewhat more impartial .
It would , for example , be very disappointing if what I have heard from various sources turned out to be true , namely , that some Member States are using the transposition of the Services Directive to destroy the balance that we , as legislators , have found by not fully respecting the rights of workers as we envisaged in the Services Directive .
A great many young people have come together in the Danube region this year , and this is a marvellous example of a commitment to tolerance and peaceful social relations .
It anno@@ ys me - and it is misleading - that many people constantly blame the n@@ igh@@ t@@ m@@ are of BSE on intensive farming : the most recent case of BSE in my country was discovered on an organic holding .
I think we will lose credibility if we now call for the body to be abolished 14 days later .
I was cut off relatively promptly by the previous President twice this afternoon .
In my view , the information society is based on two pillars , technological development on the one hand and social and soci@@ etal development on the other .
However , I am quite certain that the demands made by Mr Thomas and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would in any case lead to enormous problems with the WTO .
I have grounds for concern that a similar development could also occur in future in the case of travel agencies .
The change in licensing regimes will ensure that service providers are able to provide their telecommunications services and networks quickly , and without a great deal of red tape , throughout Europe .
Mr President , yesterday , the Council of Europe &quot; s investig@@ ator Dick Marty stated that the suspicion had been confirmed that the CIA had , on many occasions , used European states &quot; airspace and territory to transport prisoners to inter@@ ro@@ gation at secret locations .
This includes regularly recurring initiatives to simplify access to the documents of Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
What fascism has to do with climate change is a complete m@@ yst@@ ery to me .
In addition , the operators are unable to offer their customers in@@ expensive mobile access to the Internet .
This peace process should benefit the people and their country .
However , more is needed in order to achieve these things than you have so far set out .
That will hardly be the case for regional airlines .
That is why it is important in our eyes that , besides being an instrument of harmonization , driving licences should also be a means of improving control and security , that they should perhaps also contain information which might even make the difference between life and death in critical situations .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Mr Titley , is unable to attend the debate and has asked me to make various comments on the Committee &apos; s behalf .
The second thing I want to say is that the present instruments have fundamentally proved their worth .
The programme is aimed widely , at institutions of higher education and post@@ gradu@@ ate students all over the world , at students within the European Union , who can go abroad , and at scientists and ac@@ ade@@ mics from third countries .
I therefore expressly support Mrs Schierhuber &quot; s proposed financial appropriations for all three main a@@ xes .
Madam President , I would like to ask Commissioner Lewandowski what the specific procedure is for acc@@ essing the euro safety net , in other words , the money put up by the European institutions , in 2012 .
Mr Gollnisch is a fascist delegate in this House who takes advantage of every opportunity , not least in this Chamber , to s@@ lander others .
in writing . - Time and again , Turkey demonstrates that it is not ready for EU membership by op@@ pressing its minorities , by launching air strikes against a neighbouring country and , most recently , by v@@ eto@@ ing the appointment of the head of the Austrian arch@@ a@@ e@@ ological exc@@ av@@ ation team in E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , apparently because of anti @-@ Turkish comments made by a member of her family .
What I hear from many Member States is that they are doing these things already , and I believe we are on the right track towards achieving this .
As Members of the European Parliament , as those responsible for ensuring a thri@@ ving environment , it is our duty to prevent damage being done to the essential foundations of life , and at least in future to reduce or prevent mistakes that we have certainly made in the past .
As has already been said , handing this programme back to the Member States would imperi@@ l European environmental policy and the value that Europe adds to it , and it is for that reason that I support all the rapporteur &apos; s amendments to delete , for they take us several steps in the right direction .
However , we will have to find out whether the financial arrangements are workable against the background of our foreign policy challenges .
Nor has peace been brought to the situation in Afghanistan .
We cannot ignore the fact that our consumers in the European Union like being able to buy low @-@ price textiles .
With your permission , I would like to replace &apos; in the official language &apos; in the last sentence with &apos; in the official language or languages &apos; .
Is that how it wants to join the EU , as Mr Patten said ?
Re@@ forms of public administration and the judiciary are among the absolute priorities to be supported in the framework of PHARE multi @-@ annual programming for 2004 @-@ 2006 .
To those businesses that have not so far come to terms with the new on the global markets we are giving a final chance to make good their omis@@ sion , but it is no part of any European protection and subsidy policy &quot; s remit to be the textile industry &quot; s permanent insurance against the future .
I cannot understand - and I think the same can be said of the rapporteur and the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - why the Commission has not made the si@@ mulation results for the effects of these eight criteria available to us .
I think the money is there , but it is being badly distributed and badly used .
What counter@@ measure does the report propose ?
A common Internet presence requires the consistent use of the EU &apos; s working languages - German , English and French , with which it is possible to reach the majority of EU citizens .
It is standard practice for journalists to criticise politicians .
In order to help the local economy and create jobs in the country itself , we have agreed that dem@@ ers@@ al fish tra@@ w@@ lers must now land a larger proportion of their catches in Mauritania .
In this regard , I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs .
This is an appropriate time to send out a positive signal and to show international European solidarity , and I for one am prepared to do what I can to help in this regard .
I believe that the new Regulation on food additives has achieved a satisfactory result for both manufacturers and consumers .
This is indeed a difficult partnership , but we affirm that it must remain a partnership .
Croatia has experienced a political water@@ shed .
Certain things are moving , but there is as yet no clarity as to whether the government is committed to those things .
Mr President , the shadow rapporteurs have reached a new compromise on this point and I should therefore like to withdraw Amendment No 76 on behalf of the Greens .
They had no idea what the 40 odd pages were about .
In the past , much @-@ va@@ unted EU programmes have turned out to be paper ti@@ gers . In addition , various EU subsidies have proved to be an invitation to commit abuses of many different kinds .
I would ask the House to take this into account during the debate on the infrastructure pricing directive , as this would be one opportunity for us to take legislative action .
A functional system of obtaining organs depends on having the same set of rules throughout Europe and on arrangements for organ distribution that are transparent and fair and can be supervised at national level .
The agreement , then , was hanging by the thre@@ ad of the conversation between Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy .
In this context , I would also agree with Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit that we need to prevent and avoid unilateral action .
The most tangible measure in the crisis package is the inclusion of milk in Article 18@@ 6 of Regulation ( EC ) No 12@@ 34 / 2007 , so that the Commission can take fast measures to combat the crisis .
First and foremost , however , the increasing pressure to perform which character@@ ises the contemporary workplace creates not only physical problems but psychological problems too .
Commerce does not want any limitations .
This is why we in the PPE @-@ DE Group cannot support the amendments that are now on the table .
If we were to include self @-@ employed drivers in the directive , it would only serve the interests of big business .
The only point of the compromise amendment was to add the word &quot; continuing &quot; in English or &quot; anhal@@ tend &quot; in German to &quot; serious &quot; , which is &quot; schwerwie@@ gend &quot; in the German version .
In France , for example , where candidates stand at a regional level and no lists are available , it is not very difficult to allow Members to move up .
Neither will these measures impact on the institutional role of the two advisory bodies , the E@@ ES@@ C and the Co@@ R .
Unemployment has risen to enormous proportions ; one in four Iran@@ ians is living below the poverty line .
Cooperation in the field of science and technology and the renewal of the relevant agreement deserve our support not only for these reasons .
We want to cooperate with our partners in the fight against terror .
Perhaps it would be interesting to check what decisions remain to be taken out of those specified in the Delors White Paper .
If you had asked straight away , perhaps we would have voted differently .
What does the President of the Commission do in such a case ?
But we will of course examine the things you mention and report back to you .
All the studies show that to be the case .
I would remind you that the financial plan for the Balkans agreed last year only made provision for EUR 1.@@ 85 billion for the entire period up to 2006 .
I believe that any common foreign policy on the part of the European Union - something that has again been referred to today - must be not merely common , but also an alternative , countering the USA &apos; s unilateralism , military power politics , and disregard for law and treaties with a strengthened United Nations , with the defence of the UN Charter , of international law and of the international ban on the use of force .
The industry that builds the machine says , &apos; We &quot; ll sort it out &quot; .
I therefore consulted qualified lawyers and econom@@ ists .
Pop@@ ulation as a criterion is more appropriate and more representative , for a variety of reasons , than other criteria such as the relative size of the financial services sector or GDP .
Madam President , I should like to start by saying something about the CO2 question .
Cohesion policy , for example , which is implemented by the Member States and which receives around a third of the funds , is the major problem area . You say that 11 % is irregular and the non @-@ attached Member said that the figure was EUR 4 billion .
In any case , the sovereign - the people - should decide .
The fact that something like this occurs despite the European Works Council Directive is simply scandalous and makes it glar@@ ingly evident that action is needed .
I would also say that unless there is interinstitutional change in terms of involving the European Parliament &apos; s democratic right of control , then we will have less power of influence over foreign policy than we have had up to now .
How many more times do we intend to debate the conditions in numerous detention centres as a problem of which we are aware but which has yet to be regulated ?
I think it is of the utmost importance for national experts on energy policy , as well as other interested parties , to be involved in setting up the European Union Energy Sta@@ r Board , so that national interests can be properly represented .
I think that this is a very one @-@ sided approach .
It is this healthy realism that we will need in future , together with a model , a regulatory environment , in which economic cooperation between both sides can be enhanced , in which they can work together more and look together to the future , but the object of this is not coherence ; rather , it is that the two economic areas and societies continue to develop along au@@ t@@ ark@@ ic lines .
What is required is the res@@ ha@@ ping of the structural and cohesion policies to ensure that , in both present and future Member States , the less developed regions in general , and the border regions in particular , will receive appropriate support .
It should be affordable , appropriate and with flexible and extended opening hours .
This does not mean that at the same time we do not need to build up new structures , or provide help and support , or create a feeling of trust .
Accordingly , the perpetrators need to be held responsible for their actions and should be subjected to public prosec@@ utions .
The European Union needs to make up lost ground when it comes to a common security and defence policy if you think that its defence spending does not even equal 60 % of comparable spending in the USA and only achieves 10 % of the operational efficiency of the USA .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . - Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the IAS system makes sense for big listed companies that operate worldwide .
In this area , it is necessary to continuously check not only the procedures themselves , but also the control mechanisms . I say this because the control systems are not only weaker the further south you travel - which is a common perception - but also , in some regions which claim to have P@@ rus@@ si@@ an efficiency , there is in fact a somewhat la@@ is@@ se@@ z @-@ faire approach to control systems .
Here is something else too : we need a more simplified system for regulating type @-@ approval procedures for used vehicles acquired within the EU and elsewhere .
On account of a few hundred people , France responded by re@@ introducing border controls , and that , too , was for domestic political reasons .
The fact is that labels do not have to show any adv@@ enti@@ tious or technically unavoidable contamination that might be present , at any rate not below a certain threshold value .
In regard to interpretation from Swedish in principle , let me say that a Council programme exists , and has also been forwarded to the Swedish Government , on the appointment and training of interpreters in the Swedish language and that this programme is now under way .
We have a single market that is not yet complete .
Mr Reinfeldt , I am not yet able to congratulate you , because , as yet , there is no convincing sign of these strong men and women at the head of European politics .
In May , at the inter @-@ parliamentary conference in Car@@ ac@@ as , we had plenty of opportunity to talk to our colleagues from Peru .
This barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world .
Mr President , I too voted for the resolution , although it is my opinion that these dreadful forest fires should not be allowed to cause further blo@@ ating of the EU institutions .
Unfortunately , this results in tensions between ad@@ joining states and regions on the subject of environmental policy . I believe the strategy for the Danube region would provide an excellent basis for resolving these issues .
This report marks the start of a new stage that is to simplify the work of these parties .
And yet , despite this history , there has not been one single incident of violent clashes between the majority and minority sections of the population since they rega@@ ined independence .
It would be best , of course , if crises simply did not occur , but it would be worse if no lessons were learnt from crises when they do occur .
It will only be successful in the long run , however , if consumers change their attitude and demand these products .
If we take our work seriously , if we take ourselves seriously , we must operate under the same conditions so that we really can stand up for ourselves .
Its use was made compulsory for all Member States .
You went on to say that it also represented a defeat for the Presidency , but that is where you are wrong .
If that trend now changes direction with the social impact assessment that we are agreeing on , then we will have made a great deal of progress .
Rather than focusing on what is missing , then , we should show appreciation for the progress and the reforms that a country such as Bulgaria has managed to make , under difficult conditions , since its liberation from Communist dictatorship .
That this country is able to use internal political debate , i.e. the imminent election campaign in the USA , to block us and the other contracting States from making further progress on this central issue is scandalous !
They mean that the statement of origin would make it clear that the honey does not just meet a fair number of the quality requirements , but the majority of them .
The deficit and sanction procedure needs to be autom@@ ated .
At this late hour we are discussing an important matter for the coasts of Europe .
That is precisely what people are concerned about .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Nisticò has submitted an outstanding report whose content I fully support .
Only the word security - or safety - is repeated .
Secondly , because in the first year of implementation of the decisions on Agenda 2000 there is already a need to discuss revision of the Financial Perspective .
My second question relates to the problems in the car industry , which several other speakers have also referred to .
To this end , we also adopted an amendment in committee at second reading that would guarantee us this right in a binding article contained in the directive , in the decision .
We have to become actors on the international stage rather than spec@@ t@@ ators .
It is therefore important not to exclude private cars and to focus more on logistics in the town .
The second problem concerns the technical revolution which has meant that telecommunications services can now be supplied practically irrespective of geographical situation . It is therefore now basically possible to offer such services on a planet @-@ wide basis .
In such cases Article 8 of the 1989 directive applies . This stipulates that as a first step bilateral discussions such as I have already described must take place between the Member States involved , and these discussions are currently under way .
In order to avoid misunderstandings , I have to again tell you , Mr Trakatellis , in the clearest terms that there is as yet no binding promise by the Bulgarian government that Blo@@ cks 3 and 4 will be decommission@@ ed by 2006 ; there is , rather , an agreement that the decision on decommissioning these blocks will be taken earlier than the Bulgarian government originally planned .
I think this is also extremely important if the task of creating a government of reconciliation in Afghanistan is to be ma@@ stered successfully .
Legal certainty , though , is a necessity - not only for people and their environment , but also for trading enterprises and for businesses engaged in the extraction of such raw materials as oil , coal , metals , cla@@ y , gra@@ vel or sand .
Mr President , if the constitutional changes and reform laws in Macedonia come into force - and we hope that this will happen soon - the country will have minority rights legislation which far out@@ stri@@ ps the standards in the majority of European countries and most EU Member States .
1997 will be a year of austerity budgets , dominated by preparations for monetary union , and this will exacerbate rather than ease the major problem of unemployment .
In my opinion , we must say that the F@@ IM@@ E is working well , that the F@@ IM@@ E had an excellent audit early this year , that the F@@ IM@@ E under@@ went an audit again three weeks ago , which cons@@ isted only in being asked to get all its files - 300 of them - to Brussels so they can be inspec@@ ted there .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , I am going to talk about the administration of the EU structural fund , something which is more than in need of improvement .
I have proposed that in addition to a simple majority of votes , at least half the population of the Member States of the eurozone must be represented .
Firstly , the establishment of a European balancing mechanism , by which under@@ - or over @-@ sho@@ oting of the existing national quotas can be compensated at EU level .
The Committee on Transport and Tourism and its rapporteur have , we hope , improved it .
We should approve the report as it stands with a large majority in plenary in order to send a clear outward signal .
The president of the Czech parliament did not mention in this conversation the event that you have taken as the basis for your question .
If Parliament approves this report , the ethical flood@@ gates will come under intense pressure .
This is precisely our debate , which is why I appeal to you to define clearly the relevant market in this context as a language and cultural area , to clarify import clauses together with the possibility for national regulation and to apply the French law to your judgement and considerations .
This means that negotiations on full membership could be very brief .
We all see the &apos; Intel@@ ligent Energy for Europe &quot; programme as being very important too .
We always talk very p@@ om@@ p@@ ously about European standards - which , in reality , do not exist in this form - and often demand that other countries meet criteria which many of our own EU Member States are not prepared to comply with themselves .
Those who refuse have their relationships destroyed , they are forced to divorce and their children are taken away - one of the most brutal means of oppression .
The Council of Europe refuses to let Belarus become a member .
That was the first point I wished to mention .
This all goes to show that in the years to come hundreds of millions of private cars will appear on the roads of the emer@@ gent nations - China , India , other Asian countries , South America and the African states .
We MEPs , rather than merely continually lament@@ ing this sad state of affairs , should be learning whatever lessons we can from it .
Could the Bureau please consider whether this could not be debated here in plenary ?
I can associate myself entirely with what Mr Medina Ortega has already said , so I shall spare the House the other two minutes of speaking time , which will be my gi@@ ft to the House as a contribution to the quality of life here and as a fore@@ taste of the working of the Hol@@ y Spir@@ it this coming P@@ ent@@ eco@@ st Sunday .
We are seeing a repeat , on a large scale , of the complaints made at the last part @-@ session and , on a small scale , of those made during the Socrates debate .
This tremendous movement will extend its influence into Russia and Belarus , but I wish to refute Commissioner Potočnik &quot; s claim that accession to the EU is not on the agenda .
There is , of course , the International Criminal Court in Rome , which would also be a key institution in the prosecution of Pinochet for these crimes , even if he cannot be ex@@ tradi@@ ted to Spain and con@@ vic@@ ted there , although we very much hope that he can .
I believe the only practical way forward for a new Middle East policy is not to threaten outside military intervention but for Europe , in particular , to support the reform forces in the Arab countries .
We can take a decision on something today that can really put paid to human trafficking .
N@@ ut@@ ri@@ tional profiles discriminate against basic foods , and the threshold values for s@@ alt , sugar and fat are entirely arbitrary - having been thought up by Commission officials on no scientific basis whatsoever .
That we shall be able to achieve when the European Union is finally able to distance itself from individual national security policies and instead combine the political , the economic and , at the end of the day , the military potential of the Union in the interests of crisis management and peace @-@ keeping .
Of course , it is obvious that children need to be considered separately , which is why we are working together with the German Federal Environment Agency to produce the appropriate results for children as quickly as possible .
Cooperation with the European Investment Fund and use of the financial markets allow us to mobilise funds at a rate of up to 1 : 40 with guarantee instruments and of an average of 1 : 4 with the more specialised equity capital instrument , which is targeted at a smaller number of enterprises .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , by opening up the borders between the European Communities &quot; Member States and by establishing the four freedoms of the European Union , we , in Europe , have brought into being one of the fre@@ est societies in the world , but freedom without security is nothing , and that is why especial significance attaches to the security of the external borders that are thus created to the East , to the Balkans , and across the Mediterranean , the latter with its own uni@@ qu@@ ely serious problems .
I can assure the honourable Member , however , that it is the vast majority .
European unity of this kind puts us in a position to create a zone of stability with a foundation so solid that it would have been barely possible at any other time in history , and we see that our aid is creating development opportunities in the accession countries which are enabling us to fund the reform process .
The survival of many family @-@ run farms in the EU is in grave danger , and at present many of them are only able to survive by relying on their personal savings , something that is clearly not sustainable .
Karl@@ s@@ bad W@@ af@@ ers were produced and sold in Karl@@ s@@ bad and Mari@@ en@@ bad .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t prevention and crisis management in the Balkans nowadays mainly consists of not taking any unilateral action which might upset the precarious balance of power .
The only way to achieve reconciliation and lasting peace is through positive cooperation and a constructive dialogue between main@@ land China and Taiwan .
Madam President , in a globalised world , terrorism and crime are , unfortunately , also globally organised , and therefore we know that we need to cooperate internationally and need to exchange data .
This one was therefore by no means the first .
As the President of the Agriculture Council said , however , this is for us the way forward , both in Parliament and in the Council of Agriculture Ministers .
Scientific data is already available , and there are clear grounds for saying that , for lin@@ dan@@ e for example , the limit value applying to adult foods is just not enough , and b@@ abi@@ es are clearly more sensitive than adults .
Nor should we forget the 1.5 million people employed in the European postal sector , for whom we bear a social responsibility .
I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency .
Who could seriously believe that further cuts in public investment will boost internal demand as opposed to sending more small and medium @-@ sized enterprises to the wall ?
However , it is important that the citizens of Europe are kept informed and that they know they can turn to the Committee on Petitions for help in enforcing their rights and we will do everything in our power to help them obtain their rights .
We should therefore voice to the Est@@ oni@@ ans and Lat@@ vi@@ ans our express recognition of the fact that they have managed to keep a co@@ ol head and that they are rec@@ eptive to our arguments when it comes to adapting their legislation in this area to European standards .
In the pig sector , of course , we have come a long way in this regard but the question still has to be asked regarding the extent to which this system should be applied to other sectors .
This directive is designed to make up for what was omitted at the time .
We are confronted with generally sla@@ ck@@ ening growth , and that in a world with an explo@@ ding population There are six billion people in the world ; one billion are hungry ; and more than 30 million people die of star@@ v@@ ation each year , including - horri@@ fically - many children .
However , that is no indication as to whether financial control does or does not work .
We cannot treat large slaugh@@ ter@@ houses like ar@@ tis@@ an@@ al small businesses .
Human rights are universal rights and must apply without restriction .
By the way , it was the same when we wanted to make the European internal market a reality .
Nevertheless , this directive represents a great step forward for Europe and I am therefore really pleased to give it my approval .
However , if the proposal on the table for the financing of enlargement in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 is adopted , this ratio between the EU budget and European economic output , even with another ten members , will not again reach the level it stood at in the mid @-@ 1990s .
Mr President , it is rather strange that we are being asked to approve this urgent procedure .
My third point is that it was said that Mr van Ba@@ alen was accused of discussing a coup and this is why he was expelled from the country .
Children in Mal@@ i , boys and girls , are to receive a good school education , where possible in their regional or ethnic di@@ al@@ ect .
We do , for example , have a compulsory rail toll system for each Member State .
Fourthly , this is about an eman@@ cip@@ atory labour market policy .
Despite all the tangible efforts , however , we must not forget certain problem areas that still require comprehensive reforms before Croatia is able to join the EU .
I have to say that , when the Reul report was adopted at the last Plen@@ ary part @-@ session , I was horrified to hear that we were back to talking about nothing but coal and nuclear @-@ power options , and it fil@@ ls me with utter shame that Europeans should now be offering African countries nuclear power as a solution to climate problems .
Above all , we have seen eye to eye with Commissioner Vitorino throughout , and I would like to thank him , because he has moved heaven and earth to enable Eurodac to at last become a reality .
The rapporteur &apos; s comments on the nuclear sector in Eastern Europe and Russia are extremely important .
Mr President , this vote marks the end of a debate which was under discussion for three legislat@@ ures .
Let us simply review the economic facts .
This is one aspect of the information that we , Parliament included , are able to provide .
That is why we shall not vote for this agreement .
This was accepted at the time very positively .
It is an extensive service , and such an extensive service does not deserve to have the agricultural budget cut if it is at all possible .
I therefore believe that is important for us as Europeans not just to show our solidarity , but also to discuss the matter and to expect our governments to organise an international campaign , not directed against the Bas@@ que people and Spain but , on the contrary , designed to defend these people against further campaigns .
That is un@@ true , as many other Members are aware .
The first bank stress test was manipulated excessively by the national authorities so that a couple of banks would be excluded . We needed a second round of stress tests to get things right .
From where can we draw the strength we need for this step on the road to Europe ?
This applies both to the private and the public sectors .
We also need a new committee on her@@ b@@ al medicinal products within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medic@@ inal Products .
I voted in favour of the report because I consider it right and proper to protect our livestock from epidemic diseases .
However , this can only work if , in future , we involve European citizens more effectively in the development of programmes and projects , as the European Parliament has demanded for a long time and does again in these reports .
Until now , the December Council has decided on TAC@@ s and quotas from one year to the next and year after year scientific recommendations have been watered down by compromise .
What the people of Europe are now waiting for , though , is signals from Europe ; we do indeed need the market , we do indeed need internal and external competition , but those in the Netherlands and in France who voted &apos; no &quot; did so not least because they feared that this market , this competition , would wreck their social security , destroying what has been built up over decades .
Everything is it@@ em@@ ised on the voting list .
Here , too , I am satisfied that we have achieved a compromise which I can wholeheartedly support .
That surprises me .
The people in the developing countries , who are the subject of this debate , want to be allowed to live , and to live in a manner worthy of human beings .
Our collective failure in the Öçalan case makes it difficult for us to explain to many people in Turkey , irrespective as to whether they are Turks or Kurds , why we are against the death penalty in principle , and that , as Mr Swoboda has just said , we do not just oppose the death penalty on account of Mr Öçalan , but in principle .
The Commission will then try again to enforce its ideas , which were strongly contested , the Council will start quar@@ rel@@ ling again , and we shall have no regulation for the coming years .
What effect will this have ?
Fourthly , let me say something about the disagreement on secondary purposes .
At the special envoy &apos; s express request , however , the Council has not taken any further measures for the time being .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks to the rapporteurs .
Com@@ par@@ ing research and development on the one hand with the cultivation of o@@ lives , sugar and tobacco on the other may sound pole@@ mi@@ cal perhaps , but it is symbolic of the priorities which , rather than promote the competitiveness of the European economy , target the interests of particular groups .
We must make it possible for Europol to become immediately operational .
That is the reason why we are holding a debate here and why there will also be a resolution , for which I am very thankful , because we in the committee have been trying for a long time to bring this resolution about .
Ma@@ in@@ taining flexibility means that we mention the focus on small and medium @-@ sized enterprises only in the recitals .
At the same time , however , we have seen social margin@@ alisation and an increase in the number of in@@ secure jobs .
Data volumes are currently doubling every three months , meaning that , in theory at least , there are two conflicting curr@@ ents .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs , who have done a magnificent job .
Moreover , as you said yourself , the House is sovereign .
EUR 126 million are earmarked for the programme with Albania , as well as EUR 103 million for that with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , and several programmes are underway , including those relating to economic development and employment .
I desire only the destruction of an undemocratic process and I will always be reminding you of that .
This must all be reflected on .
The Commission can therefore only agree to proposed amendments which impact on the budget if they are offset by equally high savings .
In brief : a socially balanced perspective and development is certainly not being promoted in the EU , but is virtually being st@@ alled while those rolling in money are being treated to more and more tax breaks and fatten@@ ed up even more while those who already have little are having to dig ever deeper into their pockets .
To know that , in your hour of need , you are in the same boat as your neighbour and to see help given in a spirit of solidarity has answered the question raised by a lot of people in this country : why exactly do we want Europe and do we need it ?
A great deal has been said about technological neutrality .
Climate and energy policy must strengthen the Lisbon Strategy ; they should not de@@ tract from it .
Because of these different uses there is a need for the application of different quantities .
We need to set a growth target of at least 3 % .
The peoples of the Member States must also be clear that enlargement is not a financial rol@@ ler coast@@ er .
Secondly , though , in order also to make it safe for industry to plan ahead , as of course new emission technology and new engines are being developed , and 2006 is no longer quite so far ahead .
I particularly wish to call on the Commission to make sure that this report is not misused to support &quot; functional &quot; foods , because I agree with Mrs Sand@@ b@@ æ@@ k that traditional foods should not be artificially enrich@@ ed with added vitamins .
As has already been mentioned , this is an Agreement with a large number of objectives , a complete Agreement intended to cover a great deal and to bring us closer together .
Far @-@ sighted American support made it possible for new life to resume in the west of the continent , enjoying freedom , respect for human dignity , democracy and a market economy founded upon the law .
Just one final point : I believe that it is very important to introduce an amendment that will link airport charges to emission performance .
In Germany this is scheduled to take effect on 1 January 1998 .
We are talking about the Sixth Framework Programme on Research , which we want more money for .
It therefore requires the approval of the European Parliament , your approval in other words , and that of the Council , by means of an amendment .
A lot of people from the north said that is typical , special ple@@ ading for the south , and vice versa .
However , it is also about effective legal protection and fair procedures - Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
In that context , I would ask them to take a look at the recommendations the rapporteur has set out in tomorrow &apos; s voting list .
The public manda@@ tari@@ es , all persons and institutions who receive money from the EU , should be involved in this implementation .
This long @-@ term approach has been one of the main pillars of the success of the common agricultural policy and it should not be underestimated .
It is fortunate that the Swed@@ es will be taking over the presidency of the Council next year ; perhaps they will be able to send out a much clearer signal .
Most important of all , without a doubt , is the protection of human health , because only if this is protected will we have a future at all .
I am pleased that we have now taken this step .
That happens to be the way things go in international law , which is why I would advise the Commission , on behalf of the European People &apos; s Party , to do all it can to explore further in the discussions - which Sir Leon described as informal - with the US Administration where there are possibilities of resolving the conflict , rather than leaving it to the final WTO decision , if only because we will be facing an incredible number of points of conflict with the USA in the coming years .
I shall confine my remarks to three specific issues .
T@@ welve years ago a dictatorship cru@@ m@@ bled , a dictatorship which from the outset did not have the standard of technical safety which we have in the rest of the world or , more to the point , in Europe .
Perhaps in this instance I can make an exception and give a personal answer .
I would like to thank everyone who contributed to it .
I always put it dramatically and say that we do not need to go back to living in ca@@ ves , but must use modern technology to cut down on CO2 and other harmful substances .
We have found and jointly negotiated a whole series of points in the compromise in order to make the programme more attractive .
An evaluation of the results is necessary , so that tax revenue is not squandered and wasted on irrelevant projects .
I can already see the Commissioner &apos; s letter of amendment : I am sure the draft is already finished and ready for submission to the Committee on Budgets .
What counts in this respect are the true costs and the attrac@@ tiveness of the railways in general , including , for example , appealing stations , well @-@ planned timetables , a reliable service , comfortable trains , and so on .
We are in urgent need of more effective data collection and more intensive research , since only once we know what is actually going on will we be able to make the right decisions for the future .
Let me turn now to the individual points , and firstly to the Cohesion Fund .
Neither is anyone able to tell me why this should now be an essential component of this Commission reform .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Schmid@@ bauer has hit the nail on the head : the fair payment model in the transport sector has shown us that we need to work on the essential points , which means that we should dispense with cross @-@ subsid@@ isation .
Here and now , we have what we always supported in Austria , namely a signal for a new Pan @-@ European transport policy which , in addition to the classic objectives of such a policy , namely traffic capacity , a favourable costs ratio and road safety , the needs of others are also considered , in particular the needs of people who re@@ side and have to live along the European transport routes , and the requirements of the environment and the goals of sustainable development .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are serious problems with seven of the transport projects decided upon by the Essen Council .
You have already mentioned the activities of Commissioner Malmström .
These technologies , which are highly effective , must be promoted , possibly by means of taxation if market forces alone do not do the trick .
It is a European problem , as we have always said , not an English disease , so we all have responsibility to bear .
I should like in particular to thank the two rapporteurs on behalf of the Commission .
However , a foundation of this kind will be created for the first time in Helsinki , when the full results of the screening and the Commission &apos; s new progress reports are made known .
We do not want any forcing up of prices .
Like under a burning glass , mountain farming shows what happens when you try and master sustainable land management tailored to a particular location .
Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work , and I share his disappointment on the minimum solution .
We also need private service companies to carry out the actual operations .
And unfortunately we must also do so in this case , which is why my group will support the conclusion set out in this resolution , namely that at the moment we will not take any further steps and will wait and see whether the Belarus authorities decide on a change of course .
We had debates in Committee as to whether it made sense to demand a right to continuing education and to direct the national governments to translate it into action .
Fifthly , there must be no internal duties , so no payments by so @-@ called importers and exporters - which are in any case an odd concept in an internal market - and there must be no distance @-@ related tariffs .
I would , though , also like to say that enlargement has not been the work of just a handful of people .
I hope that this very difficult and polar@@ ised situation will be taken into account in the creation of a new regulatory framework and that the Commission will incorporate these key issues that I have raised .
It is not a step forward , but a step backward for European integration .
What you failed to mention was the deep differences between Europe &apos; s two largest governments on this issue .
I believe that the United States , China and the other countries working on these pru@@ dential issues and preparing better systems for the future in these particular circumstances have also recognised this signal .
At present that is all I can say in reply to your question whether there may be a delay .
I hope that we will soon conclude the conciliation on this and that we will then move on to implementing and monitoring the measures on working time across Europe .
It dis@@ regards all efficiency and energy saving issues , not because they are unimportant but because they are dealt with elsewhere .
Finally , let me comment briefly on Turkey as well .
But what there has been too little of at home is the clear disclosure and pursuit of fraud .
In saying this , I want to highlight the purposeful way in which negotiations were handled , preventing us from being bogged down in any single area , or even in what might have been matters of merely secondary importance , so that , on the contrary , we always proceeded with negotiations with their ultimate purpose in mind .
There are still , however , many loopholes , and Parliament has to ensure that these loopholes are closed .
Other regions must decide on their own regulations .
I have been accused on several occasions in this House of only having an interest in this matter due to the Italian election campaign .
The CAP is intended to be sustainable and competitive , to supply consumers with safe , high @-@ quality food and also to promote renewable forms of energy .
But I think it is completely justified , and I would like to state quite categorically that I wish to protest at the way this part @-@ session is being conducted , both on behalf of my group , and as rapporteur .
These structures must be ration@@ alised , perhaps in the hands of the Commission with their own legiti@@ mation via the Council .
I was therefore rather disappointed when he approached this report from a purely statistical point of view and only talked about quotas .
Tomorrow will be too late !
Mr President , I welcome the importance the Commission is atta@@ ching to this subject today .
The fish used for this dish are caught both in third countries and by the European fleet .
However , we believe that the rapporteur is right , and that o@@ lives should actually be har@@ vested .
There has been a long , intensive and fruitful debate on whether materials that are classified as carcinogenic , muta@@ genic or re@@ proto@@ x@@ ic could be used in exceptional cases .
That is why we need to force all the parties , as a matter of urgency , to get round the table and talk to each other , but it also means that we have to play our part .
A further difficulty is that the impression appears to have been created that we want to use our new fleet policy to punish countries which voluntarily did more in the past than they were required to .
If it has been mis@@ translated , fair enough , but if not , we shall naturally have to delete the reference to &apos; principally medical waste &apos; , because that is not true ; it is nonsense , as everyone knows !
It is clear that this case , at the end of the day , not only has the most profound effect on individual women &quot; s right to choose , but that it is also and at the same time a highly political act , and that is why we cannot accept the violation of two of the four basic freedoms .
It is clear to us that the spark@@ le of Rio has gone .
I would have liked more in the field of employment policy and also in many other areas , but here it was not the Commission , but the Council that was , regrettably , very cautious and hesitant , as President Prodi has already pointed out .
We do know that the EFSA studies make repeated references to Mon@@ san@@ to .
But where are they when it comes to the financial action plan and the regulation of investment markets ?
With my changes , I should also like , however , to go on emphasising that the Commission and the relevant States are obliged to comply with the rules for budget supervision and efficient administration .
You are lying in that respect !
This House will then have spoken , and its political will will then have been made manifest .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President , ladies and gentlemen , we should begin by saying to those watching us , who have found their way here in greater numbers than we MEPs , that we do not differ as regards our objective .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , first , of course , thank you very much for your praise of our work .
Sup@@ por@@ tive measures are what we are here for .
I would stress once again that this year the Court of Auditors again found , for the year 2001 , that the financial statement , the budget account gives a true picture of the revenue and expenditure .
However , in this case , the mistakes are someone else &apos; s responsibility .
These great challenges , which have arisen in recent years , do not find us in a state of fear .
Commissioner , do you share the view that human rights standards , social standards and environmental standards need to be removed from the special arrangements and incorporated in the list of GSP criteria ?
Single parents are at particularly high risk of poverty and society needs to show more solidarity in this respect .
I therefore appeal to you , for the sake of growth and employment , to make transport policy the central plan@@ k in your strategy .
Those who demanded these roll @-@ call votes on amendments that contain nothing but questions ought to explain to their voters how much that cost .
I see this , though , as giving rise to three specific demands .
It is in the light of this that we should give ourselves time to engage in detailed discussion of the Dis@@ aster Fund .
Mr Fischler , firstly a few comments on some of your answers . We should come back to the At@@ two@@ oll report again in the Committee on Fisheries .
On the other hand , though , the firms that took our official on and enabled these to work for them say that they learned a great deal from it and now have a far better idea of what is feasible at the European level and of what is not .
When we fight crime , when we proceed now - as Mr Poettering very lu@@ ci@@ dly and rightly said - to bring certain domains such as asylum or immigration under the Community umbrella as a matter of urgency , we not only need to intensify cooperation among Member governments , as the President @-@ in @-@ Office advocated .
I ask them to consider once more what , over this past six months , was , in their eyes , the main problem , one on which the Germans may perhaps be able to make progress , perhaps a word , a sentence , solidarity , the constitution , subsidiarity , or bureaucracy , but it should be brief and to the point .
We may actually have to fear , as regards economic questions in particular , that the airlines will soon face even bigger problems .
We have had that on paper for years , but it has not been put into practice .
Because then he would have what he wanted .
As a result , at least 30 % of mil@@ ls must be controlled in sit@@ u .
I ask the plenary to endorse the committee &apos; s proposal .
The other side of the euro coin is , however , the lack of consistency and the lack of accountability , and here there are , of course , some questions for the Commission .
So , without wishing to seem presu@@ mp@@ tuous , I would again like to express my most heartfelt thanks to you , not only for showing us so much respect , but also for demonstrating your interest in working with us .
For this reason , we are calling in our joint resolution for a coordinated and coherent approach to the challenges which face us , in particular , with regard to the economic and financial crisis , foreign and security policy , development cooperation , climate and energy policy and the negotiations in the Doha round .
The examples that I have given show how important it is for us also to create a legal framework for services of general economic interest , so that social rights , such as labour rights , can also be fully and completely respected once again .
At the end of the day , adding or sub@@ trac@@ ting a whole year or six months to or from the minimum or maximum penalty helps nobody .
Just imagine if we Greens had done that .
Education , mobility and job prospects are becoming ever more closely linked in a chain of cause and effect .
My third point is one that affects not only us but also the countries of Asia .
There is no doubt that the West - in other words , Europe and the US - should maintain its position as the global leader in the areas of research , innovation and development .
I would like to respond to Mr Sac@@ r@@ é@@ de@@ us &quot; interesting comment on Turkey and Cyprus by pointing out that it was the Commission that made the explicit political connection between the Cyprus issue and Turkey &quot; s political aspirations towards Europe and declared that it was hard to imagine us being able to initiate accession negotiations with a country that did not recognise an EU Member State or had sta@@ tioned troops in it in such numbers as to contraven@@ e United Nations resolutions .
So let us , in future , make a better job of things in Europe !
But we should look to the future .
We have politicians who believe that an additional article or law can create jobs .
That is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists has ensured in the report that the Commission &apos; s present proposal can only be implemented once the earlier directive has been transposed in full .
You are ren@@ owned for your critical attitude , Mr Bösch , but you are also known for your thorough@@ ness and for the enormous amount of time and effort you devote to your reports . You are also well known for actually giving your full support to those measures you say you will support .
I would also like to thank him for being more specific in response to proposals from my group .
Today I know that only the peace process , not military action , can achieve this . &apos;
O@@ vern@@ ight , or to be more precise between 30 April and 1 May next year , a stroke of a ma@@ them@@ a@@ tical pen will turn poor wre@@ t@@ ches into wealthy people , although they will not have a cent more to their name .
The Lisbon strategy of 2000 has the ambitious objective of making the EU the strongest economic area in the world .
In this report , we are again calling on the United States , but also on India and China , to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and to join with the European Union in taking responsibility for sustainable development worldwide .
Mr Pin@@ el &apos; s comment earlier was correct .
But I must also say that there were some very good things in this resolution , not just that it calls on the Council to lay down a procedure which enables individual Commissioners to be called to account but also the fact that it repro@@ aches the Council for failing to assume its responsibilities to some extent , for it should already have taken a position on several occasions , which it did not do ; in the end it was mainly thanks to the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control and this Parliament that we saw any movement at all here .
Mr President , Commissioner , the latest findings in accident research show that 50 % of fat@@ ally injured vehicle occup@@ ants do not have their se@@ at@@ belts fa@@ st@@ ened .
Here too there is repression , the violation of human rights and , after 11 September 2001 , yet more suppression under the pretext of combating terrorism .
Nonetheless , there are exceptions .
So , in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting , to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions , the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , may I first say as an aside that , with all due respect , you cannot blame the weather for everything .
- Mr President , first a brief word on a point of order . The vote has been brought forward to today , but Members have not been made aware of it .
In its resolution the European Parliament will highlight the paths it considers appropriate .
But we consider it extremely important , and the foreign ministers agreed on this , to formulate a central strategy , which cannot , however , be regarded as the conventional kind of assistance , as Russia is too big to allow us to talk in terms of assistance ; it is a far too important , central partner in terms of European security , European stability .
This difference in the sever@@ ity of the penalty is something which concerns us in all cases , most particularly if it involves the ultimate penalty , the death penalty .
The outcome is not exactly what we would have wanted .
It would appear from television reports that the government has cut social security benefits for the Roma , which has prompted many women and mothers - and , app@@ all@@ ingly enough , their children as well - to loo@@ t food shops in order to get food .
It has proceeded by taking the following steps : first by esti@@ mat@@ ing the sum in aid needed from the EU budget ; secondly , by setting new priorities within foreign policy activities , so that funds can be re@@ deployed for South @-@ Eastern Europe and , thirdly , by proposing a redeployment between categories , i.e. between the various political areas .
Mr President , my group had agreed to request roll @-@ call votes .
I remember how Mr Zal@@ m , the Finance Minister , addressed our committee and , amongst other things , called for everyone to be treated equally .
Accordingly , I would suggest that if we can reach agreement on the frequency of vali@@ dation , we ought perhaps to be able to reach agreement on this aspect as well .
Although I voted for it I am not completely happy with it as fishing is the main@@ stay of life for the people of Guinea @-@ Bis@@ sau .
This is why the Commission must have a powerful voice .
This means that a sustainable basis for the Lamfalussy Process still needs to be created in 2008 .
This meant that the conference could pursue a clearer and better @-@ defined objective .
The future President of the European Bank in London recently stated that we in the West were pleased about many of the spectacular privati@@ sations in Russia and did not see that the essential economic and political institutions were not being created .
Then we can endorse the proposals .
Although one measure or another perhaps meets all the requirements in one Member State , it may completely by@@ pass them in another region , which is why we wonder@@ ed during our discussions if it made sense for the Commission to set focal points for training etc. in annual programmes .
Our group &apos; s support would have been even greater and more heartfelt if the following points had been taken into account . Firstly , the CFSP must be a common policy for all .
That has already been pointed out .
I am delighted that the rapporteur supports our proposal .
When the matter comes before Parliament , therefore , we often have to reach our decisions very quickly if we want to make the internal market a reality for the citizens of Europe .
That is where the people of Europe are to be found .
I am a bit of a black s@@ wan here today , but I hope that those men who are not here today will , when the vote is taken , do the right thing and advance the policy of this report a few steps further - and I hope that they will also do so in future .
Then , Commissioner Lewandowski quite rightly says : we need a political vision for the future of the European Union , and yet he does not tell us what that might look like .
I would be happy to provide you with the text .
The Commission believes that it is very important for the views expressed by various groups during this consultation process to be taken fully into account when drafting the future legislative provisions .
This is compo@@ und@@ ed by the fact that 15 % of these young people dropped out of school and thus lack any qualifications for the labour market .
The agreement concluded between the Bulgarian Government and the Commission provides for units 1 and 2 of the nuclear power station at Kozloduy to be conclusively shut down before 2003 .
Nowhere is the idea of a &apos; fortress Europe &apos; so tangible as at the external borders .
Madam President , the death of the dis@@ sident Orlando Zap@@ ata as a result of a hunger strike and the arrest of the blo@@ g@@ ger Yo@@ ani Sánchez , who told the world about day @-@ to @-@ day life in Socialist Cuba , make clear that we must continue with the link established in our Cuba policy in 1996 with progress on democratisation and human rights .
What we also need - I am pleased to see that you mentioned them - are instruments to fight against illegal immigration , the criminal trade in human beings and the abuse of asylum .
Or@@ han P@@ am@@ u@@ k is being put on trial .
In this respect , the proposal is not very well thought out .
Eff@@ orts to successfully combat international crime are right and proper .
The Council was unable to agree on a longer regulation at the time and the rules in question therefore expire at the end of this year .
It makes the rights of the public in respect of the bodies and institutions of the European Union transparent , and it clo@@ ses a loophole in the protection of people &apos; s fundamental rights .
I am therefore very pleased that , among other things , it has also been indicated clearly in the recitals that , on the one hand , we are of course not prepared to accept criminal activity , but on the other hand we are also not prepared to allow intervention without the verdict of a judge , without a legal basis .
Bio@@ diversity is the basis for the existence of the whole of human@@ kind , which implies that biodiversity and natural habitats must be preserved .
The Americans , among others , are much better at it .
Third , there must be har@@ sh@@ er penalties for illegal disposal , and I also think - and I am directing my comments here at the Commission - that Europol and Eurojust should support the Italian police and prosecutors in their fight against organised crime .
The burning issue at present is not comparative tests , but coexistence between seed containing genetically modified organisms and seed for organic farming , which cannot contain GMOs by law .
How are members of the public meant to submit applications if they have to get a consul@@ tant to do it for them ?
Our debates about chemicals are too often conducted on a very ir@@ rational level .
O@@ ften we are able to help them solve their problems , but often our hands are tied because , even when there is European involvement , the legal basis needed in order to take action is lacking .
Those who follow the European media and those who , for example , have read today &apos; s edi@@ tion of Da@@ ily Out@@ look Afghanistan will know that violence in Afghanistan has now become much more widespread and common@@ place .
Finally , the pharmaceutical package includes a proposal for improved patient information .
It is indeed shameful that these human rights debates , which are actually very important to us Europeans who believe in values , always take place on Thursday after@@ no@@ ons when most people have already left .
I would like to highlight two points where action is needed and where we intend to move closer together , but still remain some distance apart .
I think , too , that Jean Monnet &quot; s comment - that Europe should help make a better world - ties in very well with Kofi Annan &quot; s message at the last General Assembly , where he said that the United Nations makes the world a better place .
That is what the Statute is for !
Mar@@ ried mothers in Austria receive a maternity allowance for 18 months of A@@ TS 5 700 , the equivalent of over B@@ E@@ F 17 000 .
Mr President , I believe that the Vienna summit was a success in many respects .
We are in favour of resolutely fighting terrorism , because terrorism is an obstacle to the peaceful coexistence of peoples .
If we , by which I mean you , Baroness Ashton , and this Parliament , can succeed in making progress with the common security and defence policy in these four areas , in a year &apos; s time , we will be very happy with what we have achieved .
We call upon Denmark , Sweden and Great Britain to come into the eurozone in their own interest before eastward enlargement takes place .
It is about winning over the public to the cause of Europe , so that this Europe of ours may be convincing .
Further steps must follow .
If you tell us that experience has shown the voluntary fund to be inadequate , which would be unfortunate , we shall then try to sort out this issue .
Well , Mrs Lulling , the areas covered by the draft directive are indicated in the proposal .
The second is : we want clarity on the follow @-@ up costs , that is , how this project is to be funded going forward .
It is true that renewable energy needs aid now , and probably will for some time to come , in order to get started .
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Macedonia was signed in Luxembourg on 9 April .
The Council could give its view if this incident had concerned its own staff .
Mr Mal@@ erb@@ a and other Members have participated in such events in the past , and we very much hope that this practice will continue
But then it is not quantity but quality that matters where sub@@ missions are concerned .
Madam President , forgive me for b@@ utting in at this point .
Today , we are in a position in which - whether we are for or against liberalisation in this area - we have to assess this liberalisation and we are faced with the problem that it has largely not been transposed .
As far as suspicion of nepotism is concerned , I can think of a number of specific ways of involving new institutions and ensuring wide participation .
This is no longer a matter of apportioning guilt , but of specifying short @-@ term targets - and responsibilities - on the way to the overall objective .
Moving on to my final point , for the time being - when talking about Ukraine and Russia - our group is highly sceptical as regards opening the doors quickly , because we have just seen in the case of Serbia that there will also be negative effects .
I do not want to talk up the vote on stock rebuilding as the f@@ ateful question in the run @-@ up to the fisheries reform , but I do hope that those who reject the Commission &apos; s proposal for a regulation as submitted , will after all agree to a compromise tomorrow morning , a compromise that would again permit ha@@ ke alongside cod , just as the Commission had rightly proposed .
Exc@@ ept that , when it comes to American companies , the situation is quite different .
EUR 1.8 billion for the next twelve months can be used to set one or two things in train , so that the people in the region are at last able to see that we are serious when we make our grandi@@ ose statements about securing stability in the region .
They will be told in their own language what their rights are and , where they have a problem , they will get an answer .
Y@@ ears ago , I myself was a Parliament rapporteur .

They give producers and proc@@ essors of goods the opportunity to be successful in n@@ iche markets .
That was also my first point of criticism , because the time that has been left us is very , very short .
That means , first of all , that we need figures , perspectives and forecasts that have authority .
It is in a difficult situation , but it is our firm belief that the industry is capable and strong enough to get through this difficult situation and continue , in future , to play an important role in creating and securing jobs and prosperity in Europe .
We are ready for it .
The fact is that we have to see that the ecopoint rules have helped a great deal to make road traffic more environmentally friendly , quite simply because the fact that HGVs , which are worse in terms of the environment , use up more eco@@ points has led many operators and haulage firms to acquire more environmentally @-@ friendly HGVs , these being cheaper in terms of eco@@ points and capable of making more journeys .
However , I should like to draw the House &apos; s attention to a number of points which , as far as we are concerned , are right at the top of the international aid priority list .
The current situation , in which there is considerable tension between Turkey and Syria , shows how dangerous it is to delay a political solution .
What is so good about this Spanish model then ?
At midday today we finally voted on the Pronk report as the legal basis , and we also said that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises should be taken into account in the field of the third system together with others , but what it says there now is that they should be given priority .
The German Social Democratic ( SPD ) delegation has voted in favour of the option of establishing a European private company .
We fully understand that we do not yet have the means or the right to demand such treatment , but I believe you can regard us from a political point of view as an equal partner .
We have allocated more money to the 2010 budget than we did in 2009 .
In moral terms , Austrians have no greater entitlement .
The Commission proposes that all of this be funded within the present ceiling for the Union &quot; s own resources .
Mr Fischler mentioned some of these .
During the negotiations on the EU Sustainable Development Strategy we finally attempted an ad hoc solution with the &apos; Fri@@ ends of the Presidency &apos; group .
Allow me to tell you what we can do within the framework of accession negotiations .
Quite apart from the disasters , we must not forget the mess that is made in European coastal waters on a daily basis .
One consequence of that is that the spectac@@ le the European summits provide continues to get more attention than the decisions reached in this Parliament of ours .
We are of course prepared to negotiate with the Council , and we should have concluded the negotiations by the end of October .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , many of us have recently had difficult personal experiences of how hard it is to obtain certain documents .
Mr President , I would like to start by extending warm thanks not only to our rapporteur , Mr Rocard , but also to Mrs McCarthy , who was our rapporteur at first reading stage , for both of them have done a very good job of guiding us to where we now are in this very difficult legislative process .
Agriculture is heavily dependent on EU subsidies .
If the Parliament President were permitted to express approval , he would have done so now .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , when it comes to the eco@@ points , public perception of Austria is often of a country with an ob@@ stin@@ ate desire to force through its own interests in the teeth of the EU .
Ex@@ isting funds will not be enough for ten new Member States , and adequate funding for rural areas and their development , along with ass@@ uring the quality of food production , are equally indispensable .
Yes , he is quite right , and we have now found ourselves in a difficult situation for some days in this House whenever we talk about the Italian Presidency , because we keep being told , &apos; now you must be careful not to criticise Berlusconi because of what he is doing in Italy , because the European Parliament is not the right place for that &apos; .
The glar@@ ing accounting deficiencies in the Commission which first came to light in the spring of 2002 encourage fraud and care@@ lessness .
It is an instrument with which expenditure can be more accurately estimated and recorded , and it is also a straightforward management tool which can channel manag@@ eri@@ al activity in a more focused manner on the basis of priorities .
I also feel it is very important that the Community &apos; s environmental standards should be raised to the level of those in the three new Member States , so as to introduce better environmental standards throughout the Community , for the benefit of all our citizens .
But let me say at the outset that I am pleased there has been agreement on the Kosovo issue here in Parliament , bar@@ ring a very few critical voices .
This report certainly has the advantage that it exists .
The control process in a developing country must take as its starting point the notion that there is always corruption with development aid and consideration needs to be given to what sort of action to take in a given country .
I say that as one who represents the political group that has , for longer than anyone else , had a European party at the European level and was also the first to actually implement in practice the separation between the work of the political groups and that of the political parties .
However , this should not lead to the highly competitive mobile radio communications market , which has grown freely , being subject to the same rules as apply to the fixed network .
He told the Committee of the Regions that the work of European integration took three principles as its frame of reference : solidarity , which brings people together and has social , economic and territorial cohesion as its objectives ; cooperation , whereby it is intended that the transnational and European aspirations of the EU &quot; s treaties and programmes be fulfilled , and competition , which is meant to make possible the completion of the internal market on the secure basis of the rules of the social market economy and governed by democratic competition law aimed primarily at limiting the misuse of economic power and guaranteeing consumers the protection of the law .
However , s@@ ne@@ aking a project like that in under heading 2 by creating a new legal basis is simply not on !
In simple terms it is ultimately about somehow regulating what is referred to as the Services Directive in the transport sector .
The Commission will , however , include your suggestions in subsequent Council discussions .
Unfortunately , I have heard you say very little about these things here today .
That is a great success .
This is the position of the Commission and the Member States .
However , if you feel it is necessary , we shall be happy to vote on it .
What we want is not just economic upturn but its conversion into a sustainable process of growth which creates new jobs .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , numerous speakers have stressed the importance of this environment directive .
The Commission &apos; s services met with the competent authorities to discuss in detail the uncertain legal and administrative provisions .
In other words , on the question of which law applies , the general rules which already exist today are valid .
At the end of my term of office a new European Parliament will be elected .
Large parts of the region are in fear of Iran &apos; s policy .
Emplo@@ yers must take reasonable steps to enable disabled employees to do their jobs .
It is just as important to promote and foster the creativity of all those involved in the production process .
That , of course , will be another matter to be discussed during the ad hoc procedure .
We can assure them that we will continue to do everything possible to ensure that human rights prevail in Russia and in Chechnya .
As yet there are no test criteria , even though judgments have already been made - judgments that the stress tests are too soft , disappointing or inadequate .
What we saw happening in the 1990s , when the states that have now acc@@ eded took their present form , was , in principle , a triumph over Communist oppression in one part of Europe .
If the Europeans now start to question whether we really want a legally binding agreement , it will call into question a process that , under the aegis of the United Nations , has been supported by many Europeans for many years .
Nor will I conceal the fact that in individual cases they could lead to an@@ ony@@ mi@@ zation or to Internet jun@@ k@@ ies in need of therapy , as became apparent in the Netherlands last week .
The Member States and countries seeking to join the European Union are working together comprehensively in the fight against all forms of organised and other serious crime within the framework of the pre @-@ accession agreements on the fight against organised crime concluded by the Member States of the European Union , the Central and Eastern European countries wishing to join the Union and Cyprus on 28 May 1998 .
Parliament will receive an official invitation to this seminar in late March .
We have the opportunity to design the European constitution as one of the basic levels for coordinating the European@@ isation and democratisation of the economy .
Thus this decision is also in accord with the explanation which I gave in my hearing to the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries on 30 October .
In particular , guarantees of up to EUR 25 000 should be available for SMEs .
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission , and Commissioner Verheugen in particular , for their tremendous cooperation over the past few years , which has also helped us to contribute to this success .
I would ask that we make this point absolutely clear here .
It does not work in practice and circ@@ ular migration often turns into permanent migration .
If I may begin with the last question , I can only reiterate that Turkey is perfectly well aware of what it has to do in the course of the negotiations on its accession , although that does not exclude the possibility of our not only observing critical developments , but also commenting on them in the course of dialogue .
We , by which I mean everyone from the European Union due to attend the session of the ACP / EU joint parliamentary assembly in Cap@@ e T@@ own , shall no doubt be addressing these concerns .
Secondly , I am very grateful to the European Union for now having black@@ listed the civilian w@@ ings of certain movements .
Plant protection agents contain substances that protect cultivated plants and keep them free of p@@ ests and diseases , and they can be applied and used in many ways .
There were no security staff on hand , so I told the photo@@ gra@@ p@@ her that what he was doing was not allowed .
That Turkey &apos; s accession is problematic has nothing to do with Cyprus , so let us not act as if Cyprus could be used as a means of resolving the problem of Turkey &apos; s accession .
Experts may well know the President of the Central Bank , but Europe &apos; s citizens do not , yet they must be able to trust the Vice @-@ President .
I should also like to clarify that it is really not in the nature of my colleague , Mr Fischler , to run off and hide .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is agreed that states which meet basic social and environmental standards should be especially protected during integration into the world economy .
The text refers to Greek and Fi@@ li@@ p@@ ino sa@@ il@@ ors , but the title refers only to Greek sa@@ il@@ ors .
The country &quot; s ambassador had a job to explain why opposition r@@ allies kept on being cancelled or re@@ scheduled or had to be held on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of B@@ ak@@ u , which must surely have hindered the opposition in its attempts to present its programme and candidates during the run @-@ up to the election .
This proposal from the Commission guarantees neither of these things , and that is why we have voted against it .
Although we agree , then , on the need to aim for increased funding , I do believe that we should nevertheless bear in mind that a great deal of money still comes from the national research budgets , and that the Member States should increase these .
Rio still managed to be the be@@ arer of great hopes , at least as regards theoretical approaches and fine words .
There must be no political and social pressure on parents in Europe to consciously decide against having a disabled child .
Why am I in favour of giving the Commission time , albeit not too much time ?
For as long as the Schengen Agreement is ineffective and we fail to get a grip on the problem of parallel societies , for as long as we are unable to guarantee the protection of our indigenous European peoples - for as long as these things are going on , the dream of EU citizenship is one that we can do without .
I also see the administration of these research projects as a major challenge , especially when we enlarge the European Union .
That is why these requirements for annual social reports are significant and a matter of absolute priority .
I would be grateful if you could briefly say something more about our approach at that meeting .
He has stated that he continues to be committed to his spirit@@ ual role in relation to the concerns of the Tibetan people .
Their numbers are d@@ wind@@ ling , and the Ecu@@ men@@ ical Patri@@ arch fears that there may well be no Christians left in Turkey by the time the accession negotiations come to an end .
It follows that the claim that this policy is close to the public &quot; s concerns is still very far from being backed up .
The Group of the European People &apos; s Party also welcomes the fact that the terms &apos; le@@ asing &apos; and &apos; su@@ ble@@ asing &apos; are explained in more explicit terms , so that more can be done to prevent them .
Commissioner Fischler , I am referring here once again - as I think Mr G@@ ör@@ la@@ ch has already done - to the &apos; bottom @-@ up &apos; approach and to our Sapard programme in Leader form , where the Commission has so far stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly refused to underpin this with legislation .
In order to guarantee the coherence and substantive nature of employee participation procedures , reference should be made to the European Directive on works councils , the 10@@ th Directive and the Directive on worker consultation and information .
Secondly , there is a need for our economic relations with Russia to develop further in terms of substance and of quality .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I value the commitment of the rapporteur very highly and would like to thank her and everyone involved very warmly for their excellent work over recent years .
For a long time , the Member States have negotiated with the United States on an individual basis and concluded bilateral agreements .
I have no doubt that these were essential qualities during the negotiations with the Council , especially in the discussions about large combustion plants .
A Fren@@ ch@@ man who is not familiar with the obligation to notify a fault in his own country , bu@@ ys a product in Germany and for reasons of time or distance does not report the defect in time and tells the truth out of ignorance , for@@ fei@@ ts all his rights .
This means that anyone who wants action in favour of families , anyone who wants young traine@@ es to be able to gain experience abroad and anyone who really wants to combat social exclusion will vote in favour of our proposed amendments the day after tomorrow .
I reject these relax@@ ations of entry requirements and therefore voted against the conclusion of these agreements as the retention of the requirement for a visa certainly represents an obstacle to criminality and thus severely restricts un@@ wanted immigration .
Several Members have expressed the view in this debate that sign language should be promoted as a health resource .
Mr President , in his report Mr Ca@@ ñ@@ ete has very carefully evaluated how the Cohesion Fund was implemented for the 1996 financial year .
In addition , we have carried out a revision for unused funds from 2009 so that a total of EUR 1.@@ 9 billion for energy and an additional EUR 4@@ 20 million for broadband Internet in category II could be put in place .
There is more to education than equi@@ pping people for employment .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , against the backdrop of the decline in Baltic cod stocks identified in the ICES studies and of demands from the relevant fishing crews for operating conditions that will enable them to preserve their livelihood , I would like to commend the work of my honourable colleague , Mr Ch@@ mi@@ ele@@ wski .
We do not want the situation in the autumn to be the same as it is now .
The failure of the Commission in connection with the preparation for the accessions of these countries is most evident here .
We see three points rather differently .
It is natural , therefore , to wonder whether this is the right time to be implementing technical regulations .
The wording is as follows : &quot; identical rules have already been applied without apparent difficulty &quot; .
And on this point I should like to say quite clearly that in the past there have been very positive developments in this area .
On the other hand , there has been a disaster in Japan which represents a huge problem .
As far as the content was concerned , it is perfectly understandable that the developing countries are interested in seeing their debt burden wi@@ ped out , but there can be no question of complete re@@ mission with no conditions attached .
None of these things are ready and there is a great deal that has not even been addressed .
We will give you our unqualified support .
The Commission has made further progress in the implementation of accru@@ al accounting , although some weaknesses are still observ@@ able .
The freight transport industry is , of course , suffering in this situation , but it is not only the hauliers that are suffering - the railways , inland waterways and maritime transport are suffering just as much .
Anyone who wishes to enter into an alliance , and I do , with the Soviet Union , with Russia , with China and with the Islamic States , will repeatedly encounter this contradiction .
But it is precisely these obstruc@@ tion tactics which several groups within the European Union are applying .
My message to the Members from the Baltic States and from Poland is as follows : we can only apply our strictest technical specifications to the nuclear power station which is being planned and which will be built in Kaliningrad if we allow the electricity from this power station to be sold on the European market .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my comments concern the petition .
It is thus logical for us to hold a joint debate on the 1996 employment report and on the amendment to the European Union &apos; s most important social insurance legislation - Regulation 1408 .
We must realise that the intensity and speed of climate change is relevant for political decision @-@ making , and even the human impact has to be specified in terms of time and space .
Proc@@ essing aids have been in use for decades , including in the production of wine and beer .
I think that is a sign of how important it is actually to establish a court of law to replace the interim courts for Ruanda and Yugoslavia .
There are still strange cases of people committing suicide while in police custody .
If progress is to be made in the various stages of the negotiation process , Serbia @-@ Montenegro will have to continue to cooperate very closely and consistently with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia .
As far as tripartite contracts are concerned , I certainly do believe that it is sensible to conclude such tripartite contracts , and I do not agree with Mr Bra@@ d@@ bour@@ n , who thinks that they would ride rough@@ sh@@ od over national interests .
And that is precisely its weakness .
I would recommend that the House also reject the amendment along these lines proposed by the UEN .
It is correct , as some speakers have said , that at this particular juncture , when the Treaty is being signed , Kosovo will be a test of the Member States &apos; resolve to pursue a common foreign and security policy .
The aim is also to access knowledge at university institutions , but it mainly involves this networking process , which is not working so well for us .
First there is the proposed wider @-@ ranging definition relating to the implementation of the programme , which goes beyond the comprehensive definition .
The protests taking place in numerous EU countries are an eloqu@@ ent expression of this .
I wish all those colleagues who are not coming back every success and good health in the future , and I wish those who are coming back the strength to stand up for a democratic Europe .
Secondly , how might the proposal be reform@@ ulated in legal terms with a view to making it fit for adoption ?
It also means that the structures in the future Member States of the European Union will have to be included .
It must be ensured that the existing balance between the Commission and the Member States is not threatened .
It is counter @-@ productive for a language indicator not to be sensitive to these future needs or flexible enough to address them , and so I again urge you all , today , to support the amendments tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe .
Which brings me to my final point : it has been made quite plain in these discussions and during the committee &apos; s work that there are different interests at stake here , depending on how many bilateral agreements one &apos; s own country has concluded .
This is necessary for environmental reasons , for two thirds of the emissions covered by our system originate not from internal European air travel but from inter@@ continental flights .
Today , all 15 Member States of the European Union are ruled by democratic forms of state , and therefore by governments composed of varying combin@@ ations of political parties .
Even though , thanks to the dis@@ sen@@ sion of the opposing side , we shall not win tomorrow , I must ask you to see that we make progress here .
Thirdly , what possibility do you see of preventing European firms from filling the vacuum caused by the withdrawal of American firms ?
The increasing willingness for mergers between transnational companies and the im@@ poten@@ ce of the national state with regard to the formation of monopolies , oli@@ go@@ polies and car@@ tels endanger the objectives of world trade to contribute to prosperity and peace worldwide .
This directive is conclusive as it stands , and should be transposed with all haste .
The measures currently being taken by the Russian Government against human rights and fundamental freedoms are casting very dark shado@@ ws .
I do not agree with the short timeframe which some Member States felt was adequate for the special tests .
We have to be quite clear about one thing : if by our policies - and I say this with next week &apos; s debate very much in mind - we cause industries to abandon their European facilities and to set up production sites elsewhere in the world , the effect on the environment will certainly not be a positive one , for in these other places they will be then be producing their goods under much worse environmental conditions .
Given the economic power of those three countries , this could well have had serious consequences for their smaller partners in the event of a crisis .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , following on from what you just said , Commissioner , may I also wish you a long political life , irrespective of the discussions which will - we hope - be coming to a head again tomorrow !
To Mr Kac@@ zy@@ ński and Mr Klaus , I say that these gentlemen will do great harm to Croatia if they obstruct reform of the European Union .
Mr President , the rapporteur Mr Bernard @-@ Re@@ y@@ mon@@ d deserves congratulations .
The scrapping premium , which 12 Member States have adopted , has ended the fre@@ ef@@ all , but only on the passenger car market .
Mr President , there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end @-@ of @-@ life cars , although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy .
They do not substantially improve the report . The third draft amendment refers only to school milk , which would go against what we want , namely to improve supply of the entire range of products .
Many have never had the opportunity , and many need to be motivated .
Madam President , the forced so @-@ called vir@@ g@@ inity tests inflicted by the Egyp@@ tian army on women prot@@ estors in T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are and the multiple rape of a Liby@@ an woman by soldiers are horrific crimes which have given rise to today &apos; s motion for a resolution .
It has become particularly evident in the case of Slovakia that our policy has done much to change the system , that its positions are now clear , and that the country is also perfectly adapted to accession .
Europe &quot; s citizens have their own worries and their own aspirations ; these they address not only to us in this House , but also to the Commission .
Cooperation among countries remains essential .
Viol@@ ations of the rights of women , prisoners and workers are published in this report , as are court judgments .
Then of course there is the unresolved problem of decommissioning .
I would like to ask the House to endorse two more proposals from the Regional Committee , one being for a project on the European networking of SMEs , and the other for a study on the particular needs of the new Member States as regards the reconstruction of panel @-@ built housing est@@ ates - a problem we have frequently discussed in this House without any exact knowledge of the challenges with which these present the Member States in question .
Moreover , when it comes to phasing out , the Regulation lags far behind other provisions , such as , for example , the water framework directives .
The amendments tabled by my group relate to a question of principle . They relate to the involvement of and respect for the consumer , and especially to the right of our children not to be subjected to total bra@@ in@@ was@@ hing by adver@@ ti@@ sers .
Manda@@ tory social and environmental reporting goes against the Lisbon Strategy and milit@@ ates against the reduction of bureaucracy to such an extent that I find myself unable to support it .
It might be a good idea if you were to slowly learn the error of your ways ; your new proposal on the reunification of families certainly gives us hope that you are willing to do so .
With regard to the new PNR Agreement , I should expressly like to support what my fellow Member , Mr C@@ av@@ ada , said , namely that the number of transfer@@ able items of information about airline passengers needs to be significantly reduced .
However , there are two points I would like to raise which my group believes to be of particular importance and which are still missing from the text , although we introduced them at the first reading .
These people , with their knowledge and experience , are absolutely made for the job of seed inspection .
Thus , it is not only the critical waste @-@ related issues which are assessed , but the entire lif@@ ec@@ yc@@ le of PVC and possible alternatives .
In the world rank@@ ings produced by Transparency International in 2010 , it was in 14@@ 6@@ th place .
But obviously here the ultimate decision rests with the budgetary authority .
We have had Tampere , and we have had a clear statement from the Council and have always had the full support of the Commissioner .
As a result , adjustments to new developments in the technical sector can be made much more quickly than was the case in the past .
That is his responsibility .
The economies of those countries were flexible enough to adapt and to deliver the goods .
It concerns the regulations on which you have just reported , Commissioner , and which will entail an update of Regulation No 17 .
The first Council sessions were certainly rather disappointing .
I get the impression that what is being thought by the Heads of Government has not yet reached the inter @-@ institutional working party set up by the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
However , the Commission will make sure that suitable labelling requirements are drafted . It goes without saying that olive oil sold under one of the four compulsory names is still pure olive oil and has all the qualities which make it such .
I hope that you will take serious steps to comply with the decisions which are about to be adopted by this House .
The ECB cannot pay for such reforms alone , nor can it afford to .
Obviously , things cannot continue in this way .
For example , their prevention projects are being hindered by the Commission &apos; s disbur@@ sing the approved funds several months late .
This clearly shows where new priorities in improving financial management both at Commission level and in the Member States are to be found .
Industrial re@@ locations are instruments which business uses to take account of certain local conditions within the social market economy . They are not in themselves re@@ prehen@@ sible .
We know that the whole European Union benefits if economic and social cohesion can be realised at regional level .
As responsible politicians in Europe and in all the Member States , we must do our utmost to ensure that such acts of violence are detected and prevented in time .
The European Commission has let our citizens down by causing confusion about the labelling of genetically modified foods .
I voted against the report .
Something else that is obvious is that when Turkey has fulfilled all the requirements , when it can accept the acquis communautaire , Turkey will be a different country .
The whole point of the free market is that supply and demand even out at a specific price .
After all , politics must take place at European level and not at national level .
A number of sensitive areas need to be exempted , especially national advertising bans for members of regulated professions such as lawyers and not@@ aries , and bans on the advertising of pharmaceuticals .
We also reject producers &apos; liability or the restriction of freedom of contract if individually negotiated clauses or the price is to be reviewed in the framework of the standard terms and conditions of business and the abuse clauses .
Now to the regulation on financial support for the as@@ sign@@ ment of observers .
Regarding services : we wish to achieve further progressive liberalisation of the trade in services .
L@@ ack of funds cannot therefore be given as a reason for rejecting this call .
It was Pope John Paul II who once said : &apos; What matters is that Europe should at last be able to breathe with both l@@ ungs &apos; .
And if entry to these é@@ lite universities then becomes correspondingly more expensive , that will create unfair conditions , with university entr@@ ance becoming dependent on the financial clout of students &apos; families or other sponsor@@ s .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what we need is a set of uniform procedures for frequency allocation .
Following the enlargement round of 2004 , the European Commission proposed the development of a coherent strategy towards the Union &apos; s new neighbours .
We have deliberately refrained from submitting any amendments because we do not want to jeopardi@@ ze the resolution which was adopted by majority vote in committee .
Mr Fischler will certainly do the same .
Mr President , Commissioner , scientific checks in France have allegedly brought new findings to the subject of BSE .
There too we have to show understanding and help the fishermen .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the Berlin summit took place under difficult institutional and international conditions , which meant that less time could be devoted to the Agenda 2000 reform package than would have been generally necessary .
We could take numerous other examples to illustrate this state of affairs .
I hope you will soon be able to report something positive to the House .
I ultimately believe that it is the credibility of your own House that is at stake ; I suggest that you look at its structure , its superfluous positions and privileges , before they become the subject of public debate and your House ends up going the same way as so many others .
The Council has discussed the matter but has not kept its word .
They have inefficient and , in some cases , corrupt political systems .
At the end of the day , I also support small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
This is primarily about weekend journeys .
We have resur@@ rec@@ ted programmes that we have had ever since September 11 , 2001 , yet which have been only inadequately implemented .
Thirdly , reform of the social partnership .
This &apos; yes &apos; of the democratic majority was the &apos; yes &apos; of common sense , a &apos; yes &apos; to a more democratic , more transparent European Union that is closer to its citizens , the &apos; yes &apos; of positive pro @-@ European thin@@ kers and actors , a &apos; yes &apos; to the strengthening of the European Union &apos; s position in the world and an important step in the right direction .
It was made clear that accession to the European Union can only take place if the terms of the Treaty on European Union are observed , the Copenhagen criteria satisfied and progress is made on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement .

Here they are being used as a means of raising domestic policy issues .

There must also be clear consequences .
Furthermore , extensive exports confirm that Austrian dur@@ um whe@@ at is also in demand on the international market because of its high quality .
Where I come from , people like that are called D@@ amp@@ f@@ plau@@ derer - pat@@ ter mer@@ chan@@ ts .
The conflict in the D@@ ni@@ ester region has now been continuing for eight years and has received sc@@ ant public attention .
That was possible under the old rules , and will also be possible under the new ones .
It is quite essential that the resources at our disposal be actually spent and used effectively .
If current reports in the media are to be believed , though , it is evident that other , politically motivated considerations are involved in what is going on in Gen@@ k .
This fund is not only a mechanism for restoring norma@@ lity and functionality , infrastructure and economic and social life ; it also - and this is important for the EU - sends out a clear political signal from the EU to citizens who find themselves in an acute crisis .
It is those who actually want to stand up for the idea of Europe who will have to bear the consequences of all the problems that have now been built in , and also of the complaints that will be coming our way .
Yet another application is contained subsequently in the legislative resolution , which provides for the increase to ECU 500 million .
This means that we have to take a rather more critical approach to things .
By the end of the Portuguese presidency , all 29 chapters will be on the negotiating table for the Luxembourg group of countries .
Even former combat@@ ants - whose inclusion I had strongly criticised - are , at least for the time being , very convincing in their declarations of willingness to work together , at least in theory , and to play a part in parliamentary life .
You can only express effective criticism if you yourself meet the criteria set .
Instead of the 8@@ 32 000 voters per MEP to date , there will now be 8@@ 58 000 .
A current study shows that it is un@@ accompanied minors who are the victims of such crimes .
It has a hugely important role to play here .
It is simply amazing that Europe can reach agreement on a common monetary policy and a common economic policy , and even implement them , but cannot agree on something like leaving the awarding of satellite frequencies to a European institution .
Is there an impact assessment of the changes to European competitiveness which will result from a reduction of 20 % or 30 % and of how that will affect small and medium @-@ sized businesses and , above all , jobs ?
But my thanks also go to all my fellow Members of Parliament , from every group , not least those from the previous legislature period during which important preparatory work was done .
Only if we act jointly and purpos@@ efully can we preserve the great , the unique idea that has shaped the concept of European integration for over 50 years : peace , freedom and legal certainty for the citizens of Europe .
The Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement , however , continues to develop , it is my firm conviction that there is a need in a Europe that is growing together , for the European Union to have real police competences .
For that reason I wish to propose a split vote on the first and second motions in this amendment .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what I have to say on the subject of the vote on Bulgaria and Romania I say on behalf of the Group of the European People &quot; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , and it is that it was our group that was the motiv@@ ating force behind yesterday &quot; s debate .
We now find ourselves in a new situation , the Council must first of all get used to the fact that it no longer has the last word .
In cooperation between the presidency and Parliament we opted for a procedure that is now gathering momentum rapidly .
All matters of legitimacy and ethics in relation to advertising are already regulated at national level .
But I do not see that as a major problem , because the fact that we are faced with the great task of enlargement may perhaps even result in reform , especially of agricultural and regional policy , being carried through with greater vehem@@ ence .
We firmly support these amendments , and this is also why we voted for this report .
We cannot have administration of multiannual programmes outside the Commission .
I assume that they are celebrating the fact that , from today , Germany will no longer have a modern immigration law , because they have been successful in preventing the creation of a modern law of this sort .
In 11 out of 12 countries that is what has happened .
Although this report contains some good proposals , it cannot fulfil the specified aims .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the objective of the common position before us is to provide potential purch@@ as@@ ers of new cars with information .
Mr President , with the Val@@ ver@@ de López report on the Commission proposal , Parliament is essentially aiming for a more practicable eco @-@ management and audit scheme .
Let me tell the House that we have confidence in the Commission and in its President .
Both large and small companies will have to adapt and change over their accounts and computer systems to the new currency , which will involve substantial preparatory work .
The European Union is prepared to assume an important role , in close cooperation with other international actors as regards a possible future , international , civilian presence .
Mr President , may I come back to your statement in reply to my previous question .
The proposal will improve health protection for our children and it will simultaneously promote innovation and competitiveness in the European medicinal products industry .
Here at least , one can still speak .
Finally , I would like to say how pleased I am that I was able to vote for the resolution , because in my opinion , it continues to emphasise the pioneering role played by the European Union . We must now answer these questions and continue on our current path , both from a domestic and an international perspective .
I congratulate you on your choice of him .
Today , the whole of Europe is asking where are the powers of the European Union to defend the social market economy , a fair distribution ?
Freedom had no voice . It was a time of op@@ pressive silence and paraly@@ sis .
To you , President Giscard d &apos; Estaing , I want to address a special word of gratitude and appreciation .
Despite that , I would like to briefly reiterate my criticism .
The goal is to achieve faster and better legislation .
The first part of the declaration concerns the general objective of agricultural negotiations within the framework of the WTO , that is to say the creation of a fair and market @-@ oriented trading system .
The main innovations are the introduction of the possibility for two or more Member States to carry out joint controls where a tax@@ able person is active in more than one Member State , that is , it is a question of common sense and an orderly shaping of the single market .
I can do no other than concur with Mr V@@ ai@@ dere , and say that we all hope that the Human Rights Council will be more efficient than the Human Rights Commission , for that was , after all , the reason why the European Union was so committed to it being set up .
We recently experienced the Prestige disaster .
However , we not only wish to guarantee people universal access to all networks but also need to ensure that young people are protected and human dignity assured by means of legal regulations which , independently of the method of transmission , safeguard these values that are indispensable to us all .
Both issues must obviously be regarded at the same time , but they should not be regarded as inter@@ dependent .
By means of this recast directive , on which we will be voting at midday today , we are for once actually doing some better lawmaking , in that we have , in it , summarised the law , con@@ den@@ sed it and simplified it , and stream@@ lined it .
I should like to draw particular attention to the amendment to Article 6 ( 4 ) .
As happens every year , what we call a gender scoreboard will be set up , whilst it is planned that a second evaluation will be carried out by external experts .
Mr President , last week in the EU @-@ Lithuania Joint Parliamentary Committee we had an in @-@ depth and critical discussion of the solution arrived at for Kaliningrad .
That means this article is virtually ineffective .
I appeal to you to take a clear , final decision tomorrow in order to protect consumers .
That would make you the chairman of the board , so to speak , who has just presented a sound work report and draft .
On the Bullmann report : The Lisbon Council resolved to turn the EU into the world &apos; s most competitive area by the year 2010 .
For us , these are the absolutely key issues in this resolution that we want to address .
Once again , my warmest thanks and my congratulations on today &apos; s moment@@ ous decision .
For me , this question is all about weighing up the benefits .
I find this sort of free discussion on a new subject unbelie@@ vably exciting .
Part of the Tha@@ i population is severely disadvantaged and socially excluded .
- Mr President , speaking on behalf of the delegation of the Austrian People &quot; s Party , I should like to make a statement of vote in relation to the Doyle report .
We are generally able to express our opinion , but whether this will have any consequences or not is in the la@@ p of the go@@ ds .
You will have noticed that legislators on both sides of the Atlantic have been coming under increasing pressure to support the decisions of their respective governments .
For this reason I believe that the compromise solutions we have reached mean@@ while can be interpreted in such a way that the Commission and the Council have at their disposal this scope for differentiation .
What effect do they have on the European budget ?
The president of the country is the president of all the people of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , and an Albanian vice @-@ president with a right of veto would therefore be an unreasonable demand from the Albanian side .
For example , the EU Commission , whose buildings were covered by the new efficiency criteria , recently had to admit that it could not meet the additional requirements for the energy re@@ fur@@ bis@@ hment of its building stock .
Harmon@@ isation in this area really cannot be reduced to the lowest common denominator ; instead , we must demonstrate the highest degree of precau@@ tion and duty of care towards the y@@ oun@@ gest members of our society .
However , I do not approve of making Internet service providers into an extension of the law enforcement agencies .
With almost a 40 % share of trade and services , the European Union has become an important negotiating partner worldwide , which bears responsibility in all areas of the WTO and which should involve all the industrialised and developing countries in this process .
I also want to point out that European competition law still applies to trading in emissions , and - Kyoto notwithstanding - the Commission can always intervene in the market if it believes that competition is being distorted .
The EU must in my view finally wake up to the fact that unresolved conflicts , cultural differences and soci@@ o@@ economic problems do not van@@ ish into thin air with accession .
This is one of the weaknesses still bes@@ et@@ ting the concept , to my mind , and I think it needs to be reviewed in order to arrive at a coherent solution .
They have joint responsibility for ensuring respect for human and civil rights , which at least means that borders become less important .
It makes sense to define profits and the way in which tax assessment bases are structured jointly and to introduce a minimum level of taxation .
I will be happy to provide assistance with such discussions or requests for information .
However , Mr Barroso , it will also be difficult to explain it to citizens if we only concentrate on austerity .
Mr President , for eight months now , Greek and Fi@@ li@@ p@@ ino sa@@ il@@ ors have been held by the Pakist@@ ani authorities .
I have just one further comment to make regarding the timetable - as far as the subject matter is concerned , I am in full agreement with Commissioner Barnier : this sort of conference could start work in 2002 . It could work through to the autumn of 2003 and then table its proposal to the governments .
For example , the criteria for selecting best @-@ practice projects could be the quality and sustainability of the projects , the driving force for the regions and for the European Union , the effective use of resources and , of course , transfer@@ ability to other regions .
I hope that we will soon be able to take certain steps at this level as well , where unfair competition continues , so that , in certain cases , all the good preparatory work that we have done can be taken into account .
However , if an entrepreneur or employee takes money out of a company , then this should be taxed in the normal way .
This is achieved on the one hand through their visit to the European Parliament and , on the other hand , by the Member going to see the visitors in their hotel and talking to them there .
The objective of &apos; political union &apos; also has its limits .
This would mean that six representatives of the interested parties , four Commission officials and , from May of next year , twenty @-@ five Council representatives would sit on the Board .
I also believe , as the rapporteur said , that we must require Member States and ports to ensure that 25 % of all ships are actually inspec@@ ted every year .
This is a people of between 12 and 20 million individuals , who nowhere , either in Turkey or in other countries , can enjoy their freedoms , human rights and rights as citizens .
Parliament must be kept regularly informed about them .
There are many explanatory factors . The world &apos; s population is increasing , the amount of land available for cultivation is limited , the standard of living - and with it the ability to purchase and consume food - is rising in many parts of the world .
I should like to make three concluding comments on this issue .
We are extending a hand to you , Mr Tajani , but we are also aware that we must take you at your word .
The case of Ro@@ x@@ ana S@@ aber@@ i reflects the dramatic overall situation in Iran in terms of human rights , which , since 2005 - especially in relation to civil and political rights - has continued to deterior@@ ate , in spite of the fact that , within the framework of existing international instruments , Iran has made a commitment to promoting and protecting human rights .
We enacted legislation on the subject , one example being the November 2000 directive on port waste facilities .
We are not going to keep GALILEO , like a conf@@ ection , for our own enjo@@ yment , but will offer it to those of our partners who are willing to have it , and we will let those partners share in the great benefits .
What I mean is that we should not forget the need to understand the underlying technical processes too .
I would ask , though , that we now do what the Palestinian Authority has already done , and block their accounts , so that there is no possibility of terrorism being funded through European bank accounts .
The example of Kosovo also te@@ aches us that civil conflict management must be deployed early on .
It is hard work but an agreement must be reached .
I would also make a point of extending our gratitude and recognition to Foreign Minister Lu@@ í@@ s Ama@@ do , Secretary of State Manuel Lob@@ o Ant@@ un@@ es and Am@@ bassa@@ dor Ál@@ varo M@@ end@@ on@@ ça e Moura and all their colleagues , whose task it is to convey , through the process of discussions , the expression of our political will . To them I say : &apos; We are with you . &apos;
I have to say , though , Commissioner , that your clear statements over the past weeks sent a clear message to the outside world .
Especially where co @-@ operation between the Baltic States is concerned , the sing@@ ling out of one country would have disastrous consequences , because that co @-@ operation combin@@ es very close economic ties with a zone of freedom of movement .
As its neighbours , we were strongly supportive of its accession , in the expectation that enlargement in Central Europe would bring peaceful development and economic growth .
For@@ ty percent of the European honey market depends on imports , partly as a result of the opening up of the EU market to honey from third countries , and prices are close to the limits of prof@@ itability .
The public have exactly the same expectation of our legislative activity .
On page 26 , paragraph 11 , concerning the statute for Members of the European Parliament , the PPE @-@ DE &apos; s motion for a resolution of 14 November is not shown , although I have the electronic record of transmission here , and the two compromise amendments tabled by both the small groups and the two larger groups are not mentioned either .
C@@ oura@@ geous attempts to tackle effectively the major problems Europe is struggling with are modest at best .
If they should experience a problem , then they should at least get back some of their hard earned money .
We need practical and efficient solutions that offer the sector a basis for sufficient viability through good stock conditions , ensure supply to consumers and , at the same time , guarantee the maintenance of species diversity and safeguard the marine ecosystem as a whole .
The third railway package brings us a little further forward .
eCall can , however , help us to reduce this figure . While we know full well that it is not itself a means towards the end of reducing accidents - something at which we have to do much better and in which we have to catch up and will have to continue to do so - it is , as a system , capable of bringing about a dramatic reduction in the harm resulting from accidents , and can also help to build a real broad alliance between the Commission , the Member States , the motor industry , telec@@ oms companies , insur@@ ers and , of course , the emergency call services .
Therefore , I would like to know how a total deregulation of the energy market can be achieved realistically in this very fragile economic situation .
Gender mainstreaming has been included in the European employment strategy , and reform of the Structural Funds involves giving them an even stronger gender equality dimension .
They exercised their powers of scrutiny .
On 19 February 2007 , they were extended by a further year .
The under@@ utilisation of resources and the great extent to which resources have been transferred is a consequence of the problems accompanying the Structural Funds &apos; initial operations in the programming period 2000 @-@ 2006 .
I hope this matter will be dealt with at the next Bureau meeting .
C@@ ome what may , we must ensure that we have efficiency , transparency and controlled costs .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the economic situation in the European Union is stable but it is under threat . That is the conclusion drawn by this European Council .
This legal framework is fles@@ hed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management .
For years , there have been calls for a concept for establishing small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in the country .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , I think that we in the European Union have to all intents and purposes achieved very high safety standards for products .
There are fundamental differences in approach , however .
In Europe we must assume responsibility for this jointly , and jointly create a rational asylum policy in this Europe .
It is also pure cyn@@ ic@@ ism when a high @-@ ranking Commission official announ@@ ces to a gathering of farmers that they should not be complaining about producer prices already effectively falling again , since they had already been making do with 27 cents per litre of milk .
Mr President , there were four problems to be solved if the reform of the European Union envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty was to become a reality : the elimination of the constitutional democratic deficit of a Union from above and of a Europe of the intergovernmental conference ; the elimination of the institutional deficit of a Union without legal personality , of du@@ alism , the pillar @-@ and @-@ space structure lacking any single competence to act in the matter of peace and legal policy ; the elimination of the legal framework deficit in the confusion of Union , Community and international law ; and finally the elimination of the paraly@@ zing lack of clarity as to how future integration and enlargement measures should be carried out to finally overcome the East @-@ West divide in Europe .
In the interests of EU citizens , agriculture must be safeguarded financially .
We therefore see no reason why we should go along with the proposed change of strategy .
The EU , which announced the creation of the internal market as one of its priorities , must assume its political responsibility in this process involving consolidation and concentration .
But that does not necessarily mean we know what will happen next .
The most important decision is the choice of a marriage partner .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs van der Laan , the Commission welcomes your report .
This is also true of the discussions on a strategic concept for the European Union that have been taking place and will continue in Thessaloniki , so that we are better prepared in terms of content in the future and have our own system for weighing up interests , from which a better operational policy will emerge at Community level in the future .
Madam President , I should like to convey my special thanks to Professor Bar@@ d@@ ong for his excellent work on an in@@ solu@@ ble problem .
It would , of course , have been better , in order to safeguard equal conditions of competition within the Community , if we were to issue regulations , which are directly applicable and valid in the Member States , rather than animal protection directives .
We have learned to accept that we cannot force others to follow our example .
My personal preference is to make people fully aware of the biometric risks and to put this issue right at the heart of the Commission &apos; s agenda over the next six months .
I would like to congratulate you on the decision you took on Monday evening , in which you successfully brought together the very diverse things that are being said in Europe about Iran .
Nobody predicted that today , 10 years after the political decision , the euro would be the world &apos; s second most important reserve currency .
This needs to be communicated , and if we do not manage to do that we will not receive support from our citizens , and that will enable people like Mr Gri@@ ff@@ in to bring fascism into the issue of climate change .
The present proposal for a directive on cross @-@ border transfers has very definite repercussions on citizens &apos; everyday life in Europe .
Even though this patho@@ gen should not primarily be treated with antibiotics , we have the problem that it is resistant to many common antibiotics .
First , there must be 100 % auc@@ tioning .
One possibility for our continuing survival is quality production in the EU .
In this debate , we will probably have much to say about the state of the accounts , and the implementation , of the Structural Funds - but not to the exclusion of other funds .
In the case of air transport , it has become apparent that the rules are not clear enough .
With this proposal , the Commission wishes to strengthen the market position of producers and counter the growing su@@ pre@@ macy of the distribu@@ tive trade .
Mr Lagendijk , we have every confidence in you as rapporteur .
Those who need the money should be given adequate grants .
If we are to set about using an instrument of this kind , we need a degree of strategic orientation .
As you will all be aware , you can tell a good sports@@ man by the way he w@@ ins , but a great one by the way he loses .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on his work .
And I would not want the opposite view to arise through any misunderstanding in the present report .
The Verts / ALE Group also requests a procedure to vote out the Commission - a vote of no confidence in the Commission .
On the way home this evening you have only to ga@@ ze at the clear , star@@ ry night sky and at the won@@ dro@@ us full mo@@ on to be convinced of the fasc@@ ination of our uni@@ verse .
Under no circumstances may it be allowed to lead to a tax competence on the part of the EU .
The ECSC currently derives all its expertise from outside experts .
It was in Cairo that population development was first bra@@ ck@@ eted with global development and core development policy objectives , whereas population growth had formerly been dealt with as a wholly separate issue , and birth control and family planning had not been considered in relation to society as a whole .
I can understand my colleagues &apos; disappointment , but all the same I am pleased that , after some difficult negotiations , we have found what I hope will be a good solution .
It is also just as important that the developing world recognises that efforts are also required by them .
He said that we cannot influence business decisions .
Let me remind you of three articles in the new constitution .
I was certainly rather surprised to hear Mr Bangemann say that he would not be unduly upset if he were unable to complete his term of office .
I think that our position , and my position , is that there is a middle way which will allow us to move forward , but it must be clearly defined ; we must be clear as to how we are going to bring about the liberalisation of the market , whereby the railways must , of course , be given a chance to adapt to the new conditions one step at a time .
However , the discussions that we had were very intense , Commissioner Šemeta .
We charge you with acting illegally , with breaking the law .
Again , many thanks for presenting this , Mrs Reding .
This report is intended to close the gaps .
And the Ste@@ ering Committee &apos; s draft is also insufficiently clear on the question of embryo research itself .
According to our estimates , some 400 000 jobs throughout the Union depend on it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my side has admittedly lost in a key vote , but the process must continue .
I am very grati@@ fied - and would like to state this very clearly to Commissioner Nielson - that the Commission , but also Europe as a whole , has displayed this solidarity and responded so swiftly and effectively to the tragedy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , as a speaker from a non @-@ Mediterranean country - at least a country which no longer quali@@ fies as such - I should also like to extend my warm congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Este@@ ve , and thank him for li@@ a@@ ising with us .
Every year , we ought to devise and evaluate training and further education sy@@ l@@ la@@ buses for our officials and politicians to enable us to measure how we are meeting our own needs for professional development .
The effectiveness of the European Union is completely dependent on its budget .
the question for oral answer to the Commission on the enforcement of regulations on the shipping of toxic waste to developing countries from Mrs Be@@ ar@@ der , Mrs E@@ k , Mr Ou@@ zk@@ ý , Mr See@@ ber , Mrs Klaß and Mrs Harms on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , the European Conservatives and Refor@@ mis@@ ts , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance - B7 @-@ 02@@ 17 / 2011 ) and
The issues will still be there , and will still be bones of contention , but it is important that the institutions be stable .
In one historic area - that of enlargement - we achieved great things together .
Things are actually not as simple as Mr Böge suggests .
It has listed these items openly .
I am glad that you give our proposal your full support .
This must therefore be the starting point .
Re@@ building the Balkans and providing peacekeeping forces , providing support for the people there , are also issues that impact on the future viability of Europe as a whole .
This is a major and very important area for the smaller States .
What is at issue is respect for the Member States that have decided in favour of these systems .
A conference on this subject is to be held in Ancona at the end of the week .
, rapporteur .
Russia &apos; s efforts to solve the conflict in the Balkans serve only to further underline the importance of this country for Europe &apos; s security structure , and I very much support the President @-@ in @-@ Office &apos; s desire to adopt this strategy as quickly as possible .
It may be a last chance before we can no longer speak realistically of any hope of peace .
There is no denying that we need transparency in the banking system .
He is now back in the Czech Republic , is in good spir@@ its and thanks the President and also the Members of the European Parliament for their efforts towards his release .
Fourth , summary minutes should be published containing the arguments made for and against when making decisions on monetary policy , together with an anonymous account of the voting pat@@ tern .
This was a very special event .
However , that means that the Council would not even have remo@@ tely accepted any of Parliament &apos; s key points .
Far from being already at an end , the process of enlargement is moving forward , and I am thinking not only of Bulgaria and Romania , but also of Croatia and the countries of the former Yugoslavia , of Switzerland and Liechtenstein .
We must make sure that we use this expertise produc@@ tively to secure existing jobs and create new ones .
Mr President , the problem in Kosovo is simply that because of years of neglect by the international community - by which I do not mean the Luxembourg Council Presidency , which has actually done something - a situation has arisen in which everything threatens to escalate and outbreaks of violence are expected .
This is on the agenda for the next FAO meeting of fisheries ministers in Rome on 12 March .
It was the right decision not just to aim for the lowest possible inflation target , but to b@@ unch it around 2 % .
I see little sense in the letter proposing a limit of one per cent .
The most important improvements are : the creation of a monitoring and information centre as an operational tool for implementing the decision to set up a database on the Member States &apos; production and storage capacities for ser@@ um and vaccines and other emergency medical resources , the importance attached to aid for isolated and outermost regions of the Union , the use of new technologies , including in notification systems , warning systems and systems for exchanging information and the use of satellite technologies for the purpose of the procedure and the references to the cultural heritage .
That is a shameful admission .
Therefore assent will only be the order of the day here if the EP is involved in the development of WIPO law every step of the way , from start to finish , and has the right of codecision .
In discussions on accession to the 195@@ 8 agreement , we had intense discussions in the Kittelmann report on the extent to which Parliament &apos; s joint political rights , to be specific , its right of codecision , was called into question .
Mr President , I should like to thank the House for the serious debate that has taken place .
Hence also the motions which had been proposed by my party , including with my signature , for an initial statement that the Commission will make specific recommendations for charging methods within two years and , secondly , the proposal that , until that is the case , reasonable - that is to say , non @-@ arbitrary - national charging methods can be used .
Although it is mentioned in several places that the interests of broadcasting are to be taken into consideration , the Committee on Culture and Education would have liked there to have been much clearer wording in this regard .
There is a succession of technological areas where European industry , particularly the small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , increasingly lacks the competitive edge over its American ri@@ vals .
I therefore advocate the institution@@ alisation of the cooperation of the WTO and the ILO .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are seeing the typical Friday effect , as Parliament starts to break up and we are reduced to fewer and fewer Members .
Lu@@ mping all these services together , which is what repeatedly happens in this House , is risky , in my view .
And because that is at the expense of the addi@@ cts , we urgently need to think again .
The almost unanimous verdict was as follows : when it comes to the European Investment Fund , and especially the various components of the Amsterdam Special Action Programme ( AS@@ AP ) on SMEs and job creation , we small enterprises lose track of things because there is a plethora of individual sub @-@ programmes , responsibility for which is in all kinds of different hands , I might add .
I can accordingly only ask the Council to finally come clean here - to drop their tro@@ users , as we say in German - and adjust the financial perspective , as otherwise we will not be in a position to meet what is required and expected of Europe in budgetary terms in the long run .
We consider the proposed reduction in the intervention price unnecessary .
The question of termin@@ al du@@ es for cross @-@ border mail has not been resolved in the postal services directive .
Of course , there must be investment in the railways .
They have no right to healthcare or pensions and they live in constant fear of being caught and sent back to their home country .
We assume that we will have reached a compromise which can be tabled by July and plenary will then be able to vote on it in July .
I think it is a good report .
Madam President , speaking as one of the members of the delegation that was sent to observe the elections , I would like to extend the warmest of thanks to our chairman Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra , for the good work done by the delegation in Afghanistan , and also , of course , to E@@ mm@@ a Bonino , who led the EU &quot; s observation mission , and to the European Union &quot; s long @-@ term observers , who did a splendid job , and are continuing to do so to some extent .
I believe that this is important .
The C@@ ris@@ is Committee is supposed to meet - it does meet and will also carry out tests .
Mr President , the foreign policy of the European Union can only be successful if it satisfies three main criteria : clarity , credibility and transparency .
What we are talking about here is &apos; renewable energy sources &apos; and that is where we shall achieve over 40 % .
We would have liked to have been able to say &quot; yes &quot; to that question , now that the new Commission has been in office for over a year and has , since September 1999 , already been directly responsible for part of the process of implementing the 1999 budget .
What I expect from this Regulation is greater individual responsibility for producers and proc@@ essors .
Under other circumstances , without the shadow cast by terrorism , this would be an occasion for looking optimis@@ tically towards Europe &apos; s future .
I would like to remind everyone that during the German Presidency with Dr Steinmeier , a strategy for Central Asia was drawn up which we have heard very little about recently .
In Kabul , non @-@ governmental organisations are falling over each other in their efforts to get projects going in that city , the reason being that other locations are too dangerous , and so aid soon becomes concentrated on projects that do not help rebuild the country as a whole .
Its pro@@ tagon@@ ists must not succeed in turning the EU into a free trade zone without social accountability .
Let us begin with early detection : the development of an across @-@ the @-@ board breast screening programme according to EU guidelines will involve a one @-@ off cost for the public purse of no more than EUR 1.@@ 25 per citizen .
Had there been more transparency or more openness , then perhaps the Commission and the European Parliament would not have been in the situation of having to hold the debates we are holding this week .
The vote was then postponed .
Without doubt , this is , to an extent , the key question in the debate on this proposal and it is addressed in proposed Amendments Nos 11 and 12 .
I am not im@@ plying that any NGO intends to exert a harmful influence on social developments , but I do request that it not be imp@@ lied that Parliament is not up to its job .
Of course , we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States .
Nothing about this is changed by the agricultural reform .
As already mentioned , we need to be more flexible in order to be able to respond more effectively .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen .
Madam President , Commissioner , I get the impression that the EU &apos; s way of conducting negotiations is listing to one side .
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur sincerely for his work .
I share the misgivings that Commissioner Piebalgs has expressed .
But we also call on the Commission to take account of the consequences in its initiatives .
What the Court has to say in Chapter 9 of the Statement of Assurance is most interesting , but , at the same time , gives rise to grave concern .
My question relates to the telecommunications package presented by the Commission , where new opportunities for television arise as a result of the digital divi@@ den@@ ds , i.e. through the use of the digital spectrum of frequency allocation .
Everything will then stay the same as it is .
Let me , however , also make it clear that I am one of the Members who has opposed Mr Bal@@ fe &apos; s proposals most vigorously .
When the echo of what is said in formal session has died away , everyday life wa@@ stes no time in catching us up .
We will have a few more things to do to the network .
I therefore ask you , in accordance with the decision of this Parliament , to accept institutional reform as one of the most important cornerstones of the tasks of the Commission in the coming year .
That was our experience at the time of the steel dispute , when all at once our telep@@ hones in this House started ju@@ mping off the ho@@ ok , with businesses and trade unions p@@ hon@@ ing up to tell us that hundreds and thousands of people were having to be laid off because 100 % mark @-@ ups for customs duties were making exports impossible .
Ever since Lisbon , we in Europe have had the ambitious objective of being the best in the world , and technology and science are of course part of that , although I am not primarily thinking of the electronic voting apparatus we tested yesterday , but of advanced technologies such as , for example , telecommunications , earth observation and ecology .
It is surely not acceptable that someone should arrive at Frankfurt airport by air from Israel and be subject to a second security check before he tra@@ vels on to Hamburg , and the same is true in the case of the USA .
I would like to add that the agreements reached between the three institutions on the basis of the proposals in the financial services area are not yet adequate to deal with democratic control , but that they can at least serve to point the right way ahead .
The criticism that I have is that we in Parliament allow the way in which we deal with the programme to be dictated to us .
These reports - in particular that of Mr V@@ at@@ anen - on NATO , lim@@ p along in the shadow of the new US Government .
The result will be another compromise .
Incidentally , I should like to recall that at the end of the eigh@@ ties , when the Commission published its White Paper on the internal market , energy was not even mentioned , which shows that we are dealing with an extremely complicated matter here .
If occupational pension schemes are to be a stable means of making additional provision for old age , there must be a guarantee of the risks to employees being reduced in real terms , for they already risk losing their jobs and must not also risk their own voluntary contributions , and the contributions made by the companies they work for , being put in jeopardy .
