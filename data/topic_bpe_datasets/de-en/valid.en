What have we done to ensure a more varied energy mix in Europe , and to reduce our dependence ?
on behalf of the S &amp; amp ; D Group . - Madam President , we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament already voted against this amendment at the committee stage .
Mr President , in the past there have been many differences and even quar@@ rels between the Council and Parliament on the subject of Kosovo .
There are positive things in it .
More than 1@@ 60 000 people are killed and some 300 000 incap@@ ac@@ it@@ ated every year in the EU because of industrial accidents and occupational diseases . That is too many .
It must also be made clear at this point that it will be entirely up to the Member States whether or not these additional tol@@ ls are implemented .
Mr President , today &amp; apos ; s vote actually shows that important issues are also dealt with on Fri@@ days .
The Members participating in that meeting also asked for appropriate explanations regarding the draft of the Council common position .
It regards the new criteria for future lawmaking as decisive in setting our direction for the future , and as making it possible to really cut back bureaucracy and take the burden off businesses and the authorities in the Member States .
It is in our economic interests to have a harmonized system of European rules providing a high degree of safety , and that is what this common position gives us .
Women must be accorded the same rights as men .
Please stop the Commission from producing any more directives like this , which , in practice , conflict with the objectives that you yourselves have set for the Member States .
Our concern over the continuing human rights abuses in Burma is so great that I am able to add that the situation will be discussed further among the Foreign Ministers .
This is also true of the new energy policy for Europe that is now being developed .
We know that , in this war , geopolitical interests are also at stake ; I need only mention the oil pipelines in this context .
One final point : like others before me , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Ferr@@ ari , for his excellent work .
Our cooperative effort must in future be focused on regional free trade and cooperation agreements .
In connection with this , I would like to emphasise that the implementation of these reforms will be a determining factor in evaluating to what extent the Copenhagen political criteria have been fulfilled .
We agree on many points , including those voiced by the President of the Commission .
We were thus not too pleased initially , but I believe that if Community institutions are used and we can start using intergovernmental procedures as in the past , then when the time is right it will be easy to arrive at a clear Community policy .
We are taking an important step forward today .
On the one hand , Eurobonds are a product that goes against all economic sense , while on the other , fis@@ cally prudent euro area countries are once again unfairly required to pay the price .
Should further support be required , then we should consider some other arrangement , possibly also involving a structural aid scheme .
That is the task facing this Parliament , and it should not withhold the truth to achieve this .
What is of primary importance , though , is solidarity with the European Union , which is to accept them as Member States and has made massive efforts in order to do so .
We in the Group of the European People &amp; quot ; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats would welcome it if the Irish presidency were yet to succeed in getting a reference made in the preamble to our Ju@@ da@@ e@@ o @-@ Christian Christian heritage .
Fourthly , we want the fishing industry to be more closely involved in decision @-@ making making in the regional advisory councils .
- Madam President , like all his colleagues , the Commissioner speaks of simplification , and these complicated European procedures are a major point of contention .
I am pleased that my proposed amendments were backed by the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
Much remains to be done .
His review reveals a very mixed picture and I believe that we really need to take action here .
It is not a question of not being able to trust the market , it is a question of getting consumers to trust the euro , and the force of law has a part to play here too .
As long as one and a half years ago , Parliament called for the Tibetan government @-@ in in @-@ ex@@ ile ex@@ ile to be recognised in the event of the UN @-@ spon@@ so@@ red spon@@ so@@ red S@@ ino @-@ Tibetan Tibetan negotiations not leading to Tibet &amp; apos ; s autonomy .
In my view , we should be looking for sustainable alternatives in the field of energy production .
This fact should not be conce@@ aled .
However , today I would like to say a word of appreciation to the Council , and to you , Mrs Neyts @-@ Uyttebroeck Uyttebroeck , for being here today for the first time , as our President has just said .
Firstly , the Commission proposals to allow the introduction of huge lorries , referred to as gi@@ gal@@ iners , should be rejected .
Cohesion policy projects make European action directly visible to our citizens : in infrastructure projects , in social projects , in support for research , innovation , in the maintenance of competitiveness and employment in the regions .
The observation that the Commission and the Council &amp; apos ; s common position have taken up amendments from Parliament does not stand up to close scrutiny .
Europe &amp; apos ; s defence of the Kosov@@ ars &amp; apos ; rights is a significant signal for the coexistence of Christians and Musli@@ ms in our future world , as it shows that Europeans form a community of values that goes beyond religion .
I expect us to be guided by reason and make clear analyses .
A lot of money is at stake here .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mr Fisch@@ bach for his work .
Commissioner , I urge you to ensure that these tests are also carried out in other Member States .
It was also agreed that both parts of the budgetary authorities will deal with this proposal in one reading .
It goes without saying that the intensity and pace at which relations between the EU and individual countries develop will depend on the capabilities and ambitions of the individual partner states .
We need more effective sanctions which will have the right impact .
The recast Financial Regulation is at the heart of the reform process .
Transparency and democratic control will bring us closer to the people , something we should not just think about every five years just before the elections .
We welcome the establishment of such a forum , but , just as a forum of this sort supplements the deliberations of the Convention rather than sup@@ plan@@ ting them , so civil society and discussions within it do not replace Parliament , but add something to it .
I would be glad to engage in a public debate on a European area of education with the people in charge of education .
In conclusion , I would repeat that we entirely support the O@@ ddy report .
There was a desire to adopt a resolution of this kind in Parliament on a broader level and with a broader majority than was the case in February .
Thank you , Mrs Hieronymi , and all the best .
It used to be that countries could fi@@ x a higher price .
There are therefore three points , I think , which need to be included in the directive and in this respect I support the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur .
For most EU Member States and third countries with internationally interlinked markets , VAT ( or sales tax ) is one of the main sources of financing for the state .
The Constitution alone will make the European Union stronger , more effective and more democratic , rather than merely larger .
Mrs Malmström , I admit that you are right that the question of employment policy in particular must be given priority .
Security is an essential component of a number of different EU policy areas , including the common foreign and security policy and the area of freedom , security and justice .
That is something that ought to be discussed this week in the Council too .
This means additional burdens and dangers in an already complicated situation .
But I do not think it is acceptable , because it creates too many unjustifiable privileges , and because we have unfortunately not succeeded in changing the travel arrangements .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would just like to reiterate the following point : what the Brussels Summit achieved was clarification as regards financing .
It would be even more sensel@@ ess in the case of a risk technology to call only for liability without making it compulsory to have insurance .
What we have to implement here is a complete package of legislation , in order that European law does not stand in the way of rapid reconstruction .
Now I am hearing from all sides - including from the Commission - how sympa@@ the@@ tically and favourably they look upon my amendments , but that unfortunately they cannot accept them because there are trade @-@ related related issues preventing them from doing so .
We must finally take action in response to the scandalous handling of the issue of the country &amp; apos ; s name .
Our aim for the future should not be to reverse this situation .
Firstly , we need transparency at the national and international levels , because the markets could not function otherwise .
Certainly it is also important to approximate the Member States &amp; apos ; different legislative systems .
It has taken us much further down the line .
Secondly , the possibility of deregulation , or rather the gradual transition from sector @-@ specific specific rules to general competition law must be enshrined in the directives as of now .
I think we should proceed as swiftly as possible .
In addition , I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy .
It is now , therefore , really up to the Commission to incorporate what the Van Miert Group suggested into a proposal .
In accordance with the EU guidelines on the death penalty , we are exerting strong pressure on the United States to abolish the death penalty at a national level , and at the level of the US federal states , and we are calling for a pardon in individual cases .
Unlike Mrs De V@@ its , however , I do not believe that we need completely new laws -@@ certainly not at European level .
Above all , these aspects must be laid down in such a way that there are consequences if they are not complied with .
I would also like to broaden the context a little , as I was involved in the discussion on all of this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy .
The Council of Ministers has adopted a number of amendments tabled by the European Parliament at first reading which strengthen the original Commission proposal .
Pro@@ duct placement will now , in principle , be banned , yet numerous derogations make it possible for the Member States to bl@@ ur the clear dividing line that separ@@ ates editorial independence from the influences exerted by commercial advertising .
But in fact it also requires certain framework conditions .
We cannot accept these amendments , because they would mean the existence of two different sets of rules for producers &amp; apos ; organisations as well as two different funding systems .
As fishing activities decline , however , these investments will become economically less viable .
Mr President , I propose that we should reject that suggestion , for the simple reason that in its opinion the Commission clearly sp@@ elt out that this is a very serious proposal .
Maybe you will take that as a warning .
Yet it is that which will be our task , a task we must accomplish over the coming years and decades , a task in which I wish us all much success .
Energy policy must look to the future , be sustainable and respect market principles .
The Commission will comply with the request of the Committee on Budgetary Control and look at these questions in detail in the course of this year .
Congratulations , Commissioner .
There are three key factors that determine the proportion of poor children in rich countries : social policy , social trends and the way in which the labour market develops .
Such administrations are also a prerequisite for ensuring that countries use their own tax revenue responsibly and in the interests of their citizens .
But I would certainly be sorry to see all the amendments simply dis@@ missed out of hand .
We in the European Parliament have a moral and political duty to defend human dignity at all times .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , I have observed over the last few months how you , ast@@ utely preparing for your presidency , have not , on foreign policy issues , fallen victim to the peri@@ l of bilater@@ alism , which has been seen to some degree in Berlin , London and Paris .
I think we can safely say that together , we have succeeded in this .
We cannot hold that against you , it is your political right , but you must be aware that the Left in this House cannot support the restrictive measures , that as a conservative Austrian , you wish to pursue !
My group , the PPE , supports Mr Martin &amp; apos ; s report .
I can assure you that when we prepare for the June Summit we will do whatever we can to achieve this .
( Applause )
I do not mean to say anything against the Slovenian Presidency , which is always very helpful .
Therefore , the high position of the rural areas must be clearly established in Agenda 2000 .
Mr President , any budget reflects the financial implementation of the intended policy .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , may I express my thanks to Mr Leh@@ tinen for the really good draft report he has given us , which provides us with a very sound basis for our discussions .
Mr President , Mrs Malmström , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , I am a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council , in other words , the Palestinian parliament .
The analysis is very comprehensive and good .
I have found it very exciting to follow the argument in this speech , for he is trying to persuade this House not to send the draft to the Council or to the Intergovernmental Conference , but to be ratified by the national parliaments .
Where entry into the EU is concerned , we want framework principles ; what we do not want , though , is a general rule that largely pus@@ hes back the competence of the Member States !
I would like to sum up and end my speech by referring back to what previous speakers have said and , again , challenging Parliament to push ahead with its own reforms .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this legislation represents the final piece of legislation stem@@ ming from the Auto @-@ Oil Oil programme .
Globalisation is happening , and what matters is that we make good use of the opportunities with which it presents us and minimise its risks , across both hem@@ isp@@ heres .
The Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the European Democrats will be unanimously voting for this agreement .
That - as so often in the European Union - is partly down to funding , and in particular to the lack of funding in Member States which still have the unfortunate habit of demanding a lot of support from the European Union .
In my view , the European Parliament must in future demonstrate that it will not tolerate resources being wasted - in the Structural Funds or elsewhere - or Member States failing to fulfil their obligations .
This global approach is part of the reform package .
The free market will not solve the problem .
If one looks at today &amp; apos ; s date then one can see that we in Parliament are tra@@ iling behind by some months .
We know from past experience that money from the Structural Funds has made a significant contribution to improving quality of life , creating jobs and giving people a future in the regions .
C@@ lose cooperation between Parliament , the Council and the Commission has had a positive effect on the outcome of the negotiations , so that I can only agree with all the proposed modi@@ fications your rapporteur , Mrs Weisgerber , has made .
Madam President , Commissioner , we find ourselves in a very complicated situation .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , allow me to start by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation in drafting the report .
Perhaps , Commissioner Verheugen , we could at some time discuss how we can change this .
That is why I hope that the Italian Presidency will take this conciliation procedure seriously and accept it as a priority .
I would like a roll @-@ call call vote on this tomorrow .
Mr President , first let me thank Mr Titley , and not just for the fact that in terms of substance his report follows the lines proposed by the Commission but also for his realism and for the courage that is indeed required in order to deal realistically such a difficult subject .
She did a very good job , as of course , did Mr Grosch , of whom Parliament has come to expect good reports .
We also need to do more in the area of competitiveness , mainly for small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises , but particularly for small enterprises .
The Treaties require us to make sustainable development the model for all our policies , which means that we cannot carry out liberalisation without at the same time negotiating social standards and environmental norms .
It is unacceptable that things should be hidden from people , that the Commission , the companies and the Member States do not have free access to all information so that they can pass it on to the public .
Hence my question to you .
This Charter will only meet the needs of the citizens of Europe under two provis@@ os . Firstly , it must be given substance , and secondly , it must be made binding in law .
There is now justifiable concern about the way Iraq deplo@@ ys weapons of mass destruction and makes them widely available .
People suffering from food all@@ ergies rely on the proper listing of what a product contains .
That is difficult .
As has already been said , they can also help these people to set up businesses and create jobs with their ideas .
There are people who say it is much higher still .
I think that in considering these matters , we should also deal with the concept of working towards a European law as an option for parties entering into contracts .
I see that the President of the European Commission , José Manuel Durão Barroso , is here too , and of course I should also point out that Portugal has recently taken over the Presidency of the Union . You too , Mr Barroso , are warmly welcome today .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one can have the same goals , Commissioner , whilst nevertheless pursuing them by different means .
The Polish Government - not the Polish people , who , contrary to their government , are pro @-@ European European - should remember that in its history Poland had the liber@@ um veto .
We are about to see the conclusion of the ratification procedure and the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty .
Grat@@ eful though I am for the work that has been done , we must still make very considerable effort to get anywhere near achieving the goal that we set ourselves in the 2003 report .
We cannot ignore this fact .
The ten@@ et of these judgments is unequivocal : the rights of the persons affected to the free movement of labour and the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of nationality had been violated in that Italy did not offer the let@@ tori the same terms of employment and job security as Italian nationals le@@ c@@ turing at a similar level in universities .
This matter has pre@@ occupied us for a long time , too long in my opinion .
Mr President , it is a fine tradition for the chairmen of the groups to sincerely thank the outgoing Presidents and so I , like the other group chairmen , have asked to take the floor .
Article 21 of the decision provides that the review shall be followed by Commission proposals , which means we should not rethink the whole matter again in the form of a white paper .
We are already familiar with the European Voluntary Service for young people , and we need similar programmes for all age groups , particularly for the growing numbers of reti@@ red people who are active , healthy and experienced .
Over the years , we have adopted a large number of programmes and papers here , from the Lisbon strategy to Europe 2020 , and many more .
If the Commission believes that the rules are not adequate , it and it alone has the right to propose that they be amended .
Of course that could also be done with third countries and would be a sensible measure .
A large number of jobs can be created here .
As to immigration policy , your document talks about &amp; apos ; an integrated approach to migration &amp; apos ; .
Mr President , the basic message in this report is entirely welcome .
We are faced here with a highly urgent task , that of eliminating all risks in this area .
Pre@@ ventive measures must be taken , of course ; I have just highlighted the example of &amp; apos ; Pro J@@ ó@@ ven@@ es &amp; apos ; as it is such an interesting programme .
With this in mind , I regard the Luxembourg Presidency &amp; quot ; s proposals as very , very worthwhile , and I hope that they will prove to be a successful solution .
I think this is a very constructive own @-@ initiative initiative report .
For example , there is much potential here for economic restructuring in order to safeguard our own chances for the future .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is a Community of law , because European law is observed and upheld .
As the intention is for us to progressively build on our relationship in economic , security policy and education policy terms , it is extremely important that all our partners respect European values .
It is all about the details : how is Parliament to be involved ?
I also think it was an aw@@ k@@ ward situation , because the Council and the Commission are obviously not acquainted with the latest developments in this area , for these were not entered into .
This , then , is a very si@@ ze@@ able problem .
I think that this aspect , which Parliament fully supports , should definitely be looked into .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
I must come back here to the rapporteur and appeal to my fellow Members .
This inter@@ ministerial committee will submit a report - an initial draft was published in the Turkish press recently and the final report will probably be submitted in June - containing specific proposals on political reforms and the legislative changes needed .
On the other hand , competition forces mistakes out into the open , because it puts companies which make the wrong decisions at a competitive disadvantage .
That could not be done under the proposal as it stands now .
Finally , I would like to say that I see this directive as raising the quite fundamental question of whether all these details , which we are discussing here , are necessary ?
We have to admit , however , that we still have a lot of homework to do .
Therefore , I can only vote in favour of the report .
However this will require the will and support of all Member States .
Tra@@ ining of police officers , judges , medical personnel - all of this is contained in the report , and I would also like to duly thank the rapporteur for that .
- Mr President , with the agreement of the rapporteur , Mrs Rühle , I ask that the network of Europe H@@ ouses be included among the activities to be supported .
Mr President , I wanted to speak briefly on the explanations of vote on the I@@ i@@ var@@ i report in order to thank Mrs I@@ i@@ var@@ i and to declare that it was with much conviction that I voted in favour of this report , which has now clarified a number of points and created the conditions for the necessary means to be used , especially where the European Bureau for L@@ ess@@ er U@@ sed Lan@@ gu@@ ages and Mer@@ cat@@ or are concerned ; whilst , of course , the other issues in this report are close to my heart , this one is particularly so .
I believe this is a very important condition .
That is why there are some amendments to the common position which we simply must accept .
For the future of the manufacturing industry in Europe it will be more and more important to have sufficiently qualified workers at our disposal .
On this basis we should be able to adopt a sensible resolution and give the new government a chance .
As you yourself just described , there are still differences of opinion on this subject among the Member States of the European Union ; that also applies to the New Agenda Resolution tabled by Ireland , Sweden and a number of other states in the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly .
We need better monitoring of fish stocks and forests and better surveillance of the tim@@ ber and fishing industries .
But we should not make party political capital out of his statement .
It has to represent the common good of all 15 Member States in an impartial way and must also continue to be the driving force and initi@@ ator of new developments in the realm of European policy .
Madam President , let me begin with a detail .
We must continue to campaign tirel@@ essly and insist on Iran &amp; apos ; s obligation to respect human rights .
It is important to us all , however , that we ultimately achieve a good result , and that European citizens then see that Europe does affect them , and that it is something worth fighting for .
That is why I am canvassing for assent for all the candidate countries and asking Parliament to give that assent .
For Malta belongs in this forum , if only because of its constructive role in the Barcelona process .
We have achieved good results with our networks , with the NGOs , and these now need to be implemented in the Member States .
Mr President , I have three good reasons for whole @-@ heartedly heartedly supporting Mr Al@@ ber &amp; apos ; s report .
I should simply like to refer to the BSE crisis .
Mr President , I would like to move , on behalf my group , in accordance with Rule 37 ( 4 ) of the Rules of Procedure , that this House should decide whether the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE @-@ DE DE and PSE groups should be put to the vote before the other resolutions .
As I have already said in my answer to the original question , progress in the negotiations will very much depend on the extent to which these obligations are satisfied and not on the nature of the declarations .
I should like to thank the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council for the Finnish Council Presidency , and for the constructive cooperation there has been between the Presidency and Parliament .
I would ask you , when you appoint the High Representatives and set up the planning and analysis unit , to perhaps listen more closely to national parliaments and to the European Parliament than to your diplomats , so that this becomes an added value for Europe rather than a board of political direc@@ tors .
A second subject that has played a part in this debate is that of the reports .
As vice @-@ chair chair of the delegation for relations with Canada in the European Parliament , I am particularly pleased that we are discussing in Parliament the forthcoming EU @-@ Canada Canada Summit . As you know , the vote has unfortunately been postponed until the beginning of May .
I hope that the administration will take this up over the next few months and work towards a solution .
The earmarking catalogue in the regulation on the Structural Funds includes , for example , a total vari@@ able of 71 for the environmental dimension . The Commission &amp; quot ; s new slogan , that the Lisbon Strategy must be pursued in the direction of un@@ impeded growth , is simply wrong , because it is short @-@ sighted sighted , it lacks solidarity and it is irresponsible , because acting in this way shifts incalculable costs onto the next generation .
Mr President , the crisis which has been bre@@ wing for months in the European Commission and which has now culmin@@ ated in the resignation of the Commissioners has sent out a clearly visible and long overdue signal .
We have had a number of discussions and draft amendments and I believe that has resulted in a very balanced report .
Mr President , the objective of our policy should be to create an environment which guarantees the highest possible standard of living for the citizens of the European Union .
I would like to appeal to the Member States - I think it is regrettable that no Council representative is here - and point out that we are giving them some homework to do .
It was at one time possible for people to move freely around Europe , with a lifestyle and culture of their own free choosing .
Madam President , we must bring Croatia into the European Union next year or at least bring the accession negotiations to an end and start the ratification process .
There are no comparable rules in any other EU regulation .
As I said in my statement earlier , there are now various fronts on which we have to take the initiative .
Uni@@ fied criteria are essential if this technology is to be promoted and a high level of safety and environmental protection maintained .
But this European Parliament is named in the Treaty as the parliamentary control@@ ler of foreign , security and defence policy to the exclusion of all others .
Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President President , first of all , I would like to use this opportunity to express to Mr C@@ ramer my warmest thanks for his good cooperation , particularly in view of the technically very demanding and difficult nature of this report .
Today , Parliament is a partner respected around the globe , an advocate for human rights and democracy .
It is obvious that you could not provide answers to several questions at this stage .
The political decisions that were made at that time must now be firmly and formally established in Parliament &amp; apos ; s Rules of Procedure so that they can become legally effective .
Given the decisions of the Conference of Presidents , in my opinion there is a need to clarify whether the vote yesterday counts as ten roll @-@ call call votes or one .
I have also noted that the Commission will be putting forward new proposals on the subjects of food safety , animal welfare and health , together with better supervision and better rules .
The twenty @-@ first first century will present Europeans with immense challenges : globalised business and financial flows , international terrorism , climate change and the disasters associated with it , and the flow of migrants .
. Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the European Parliament most sincerely for the strong support enjoyed by the Commission throughout this programme .
In particular , the planned joint action for the introduction of a bank levy or financial transaction tax at a global level should also be emphasised in this context .
This policy is harmful to the people of Israel and therefore to peace in the Middle East .
Mr President , I will in a moment be presenting the decisions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , a somewhat ins@@ ane undertaking and just as ins@@ ane as the way in which some of our debates were organised , with such results .
To close , we need to bear two further points in mind .
I therefore welcome the European Union &amp; apos ; s decision to create EULEX .
From now on , it must go without saying that extending individual parts of the WTO rules or over@@ hau@@ ling them completely can only be possible once this institution is at long last democratic , once it is transparent and once it is less authoritarian .
So I do not really think this amendment is necessary .
Despite that , the sanctions mechanism has not yet ki@@ cked in .
There is also a new compromise within the Council .
I would point out that any alteration to the directive could jeopardi@@ ze the compromise which it has taken two and a half years of hard bargaining to reach , and I therefore feel it is vital that we should exercise some restraint when it comes to proposing amendments .
Cross @-@ border border environmental problems can only be combated effectively through international cooperation .
If the Convention is to be a success and ultimately if the European Union is to be viable in the future , it will , in my view , be crucial for us to succeed in making the European Union more democratic across the board and in strengthening the rights of individual people .
A number of very interesting proposals have been made here .
Much ought to have been done here in the last few years and it still has not been done , including establishing genuine coordination between the Member States .
What is most important for the European Union , as Mr Val@@ ver@@ de López said , seems to me to be the establishment of appropriate research priorities in the fifth framework programme of research .
We parliamentarians have repeatedly pronoun@@ ced ourselves in favour of a European constitution and a federal Europe - from Spinelli to Herman through to the most recent reports .
In this connection , the Commission will carry out an investigation into risk management instruments in agriculture , the findings of which will be available in the next few months , and they are bound to be the subject of intense discussion in this House thereafter .
In other words , the Council recognises these demands and these commitments .
That much we all agree upon .
Secondly , it must be possible to implement , for example , the Multil@@ ateral Environment Agreement without trig@@ gering conflicts with the WTO .
In my view , the partnership agreement remains the central element in the West &amp; apos ; s strategy for partnership with Russia .
Particularly in the field of research and development , it is important that , in future , we should pay more attention to renewable energy , and I especially have in mind gas from land@@ fill sites and se@@ wage treatment plants , for which there is a role in this regard .
Nevertheless , a very important step is being taken today and we are giving a signal .
His report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
We must say &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; to CCS , &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; to nuclear power and to renewable energy and &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; to energy saving .
It is essential for the European Parliament to be involved in the guidelines , that much we agree upon .
In the light of the Kosovo debate , we see how important this Treaty is because through it we are far more likely to achieve a common foreign and security policy .
We politicians can of course discuss those actions of ours that are causing offence - for example where , as in Denmark , legislation on foreign nationals has been passed that off@@ ends and fails to respect immigrants .
The Commission itself has just made this fact public .
The Commission used these measures as the basis for its own assessment .
It stands to reason that there is no doubt that we will see to it that the agreed sanctions , controls and inspections are actually implemented throughout the EU and in the same manner .
We , for our part , shall certainly vote against that amendment .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , nowadays , an outbreak of foot and mouth disease even in one small part of one Member State has very rapid and grave effects on the Community as a whole .
We also endorse your belief in a European Union that is more than merely an internal market and a common European currency .
The same applies to the next oral amendment .
Madam President , human rights are the foundation of each national constitution and a major benefit for every man and woman .
And I believe that this is very important .
It is all about creating a socially just Europe .
There is a tendency in the major capitals of the European Union to regard the EU &amp; apos ; s foreign , security and defence policy as a continuation of each country &amp; apos ; s own national policy financed with European money .
We must not , however , repeat the mistake of deciding who is the good w@@ inner and who is the bad w@@ inner of the elections . We must instead recognise the democratic development .
This is the legal clarity we want .
Perhaps by that time we shall have achieved codecision on matters of agricultural policy , because decisive moves were made at Nice in the direction of parliamentary codecision ; we only have to ensure in the post @-@ Nice Nice discussions that these good intentions are put into practice .
Legal certainty must be the main concern .
What we need now is joint and tangible action within the agreed timeframe , not national squab@@ bling .
I recognise that he has taken on board five demands from the Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party , inter alia , with regard to the legislative right of nomination of the European Parliament , the conduct of the Commissioners in the case of a vote of no @-@ confidence confidence and the necessary permanent dialogue concerning Commission reform .
I believe that we can expect a fruitful cooperation with all groups .
Thank you for your accurate and comprehensive answer .
This is in the interests of the European Union as a whole and of its capacity to act even with 25 members .
We need structural reforms in the European economy .
We must make sure that we have appropriate funding for all these tasks .
However , in addition to this individual assistance for the workers affected , the European Union also needs to take additional measures to deal with the effects of the financial crisis .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , I too would like to thank Mrs Ayuso for this report and for the work she has done .
Then there will be change in Kosovo .
- Mr President , this House has always welcomed the accession of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe ; we always spoke up for the people in these states who wanted their ti@@ cket to enter the European Union .
I would like to congratulate Mr Kallas warmly in this respect .
Europe must play a pioneering role , in particular in the international arena .
Time and again there have been attempts to limit or even to reduce the scope of patent rights by over@@ loading the Directive with rules which have no basis in patent law .
In particular , we should ensure that we are more effective on the key foreign policy issue , but we should also remember that through closer cooperation , we have made much more progress than has been discussed in public so far , including the option of an obligation to provide support .
We now have written explanations of vote .
I have something to say on one point which may well be important for the negotiations .
I am pleased to see the Commissioner is now with us .
Mr President , I would like to make an explanation of vote on behalf of my delegation and say right away that we intended to vote for Amendment No 26 and paragraph 27 .
Mr President , we are currently witnessing massive attacks on the freedom of the press .
I am therefore particularly grateful to the rapporteur of the lead committee , Mr Markus Ferber , for having produced an acceptable compromise which largely takes account of the letter and spirit of my amendments . I can live with this , especially since
Madam President , the Council of Europe &amp; apos ; s Parliamentary Assembly can discuss any subject .
Mr President , I would very much like to table an oral amendment to the Liberals &amp; apos ; Amendment No 38 , in which it is stated that the candidates for accession are to start with the transposition of the laws against discrimination .
The idea of burden@@ ing farms with new and unnecessary formalities and costs is not acceptable .
That is a dishonest approach !
I can only say that Europe must come together , also in terms of its security and foreign policy , otherwise decisions will be taken elsewhere .
Solidarity , however , is never a one @-@ way way street , and my group therefore backs the principle that all the regions of the European Union must be able to participate in our cohesion policy .
At the end of the day , we arrived at figures that bo@@ il down to 1.@@ 18 % in commitment appropriations and 1.@@ 0@@ 7 % in payment appropriations .
Now I sometimes hear it said that a democratic process in the traditional sense is no longer possible in Europe because there is no single European nation .
I hope that you will address this issue in your speech .
There are enough women who are dissatisfied with the continuing severe discrimination against women .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately , the Prodi Commission &amp; apos ; s existing policy on fighting fraud can really only be described as hesitant and di@@ lat@@ ory when it comes to the really crucial questions .
Yet Article 4 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets merely refers to the Court of Auditors in this context .
The urgent need for European industry to improve its competitiveness makes space policy a compulsory subject for the European Council .
Thank you for your attention . I hope that on Thursday you will support my group and myself by voting to give our assistants social security and to preserve the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s autonomy .
Please be assured that the Commission has the support of a large majority of Members of this House .
Mr President , this is not supposed to be a dialogue .
That is why we should not always be setting France against the USA in the matter .
I would like to point out that , over the next few years , three EU Member States in succession , namely Belgium , Spain and Finland , will hold the chairmanship of the OSCE .
In this respect , monitoring and implementation were our weak points .
Any country excluding itself in this way from European development cannot do other than become a security problem for the European Union .
Moreover , the Commission is in any case intending to draft a white paper on environmental liability , which it will be presenting shortly .
The President of the Commission is right to say that investment in innovation is indispensable , not only here , but in all the Member States , and particularly in rese@@ arching and developing energy @-@ efficient efficient technology .
They have done a huge amount of work and , as a result , definite progress has been made .
At present the situation is untenable .
I also think that it is our duty to work on the American public , so that they follow our lead .
It is important that the social partners should be able to use the opportunities that the Treaty on European Union offers them .
We have taken the first step with this regulation .
We are faced with the question of whether to do something to at least ensure safe operation and perhaps gradually improve it , knowing full well that this might lead to the nuclear power station which you want to shut down remaining in operation longer than would otherwise be the case .
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one @-@ and and @-@ a a @-@ half half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote .
The political priority attaching to enlargement is also reflected in administrative expenditure : the Commission will , as stated in the communication of 2002 and reiterated a few moments ago by your general rapporteur , apply for the next bat@@ ch of additional posts for enlargement .
You , Commissioner , will recall how , at the hearing , I asked you for a programme that combined energy policy and foreign policy .
It is no longer possible to use international treaties to make blind agreements with trade partners that will then affect European legislation down the line .
The risk that this will send the wrong signal to the newly industrialised countries with which the EU has strong historical , political and cultural links should not be underestimated .
Consider@@ ation of the facts makes it clear why this is so .
Who will say &amp; apos ; We want to maintain peace throughout the world and ensure that conflicts do not turn into wars &amp; apos ; ?
We must now institution@@ alise dialogue between the Ecofin Council , the ECB , those responsible for social policy , the social partners , the Council , the Commission and the European Parliament in order to better coordinate economic and monetary policy , including the indispensable Stability Pact , with employment policy .
I sometimes get the impression that members of the Council and some countries are afraid to have the courage of their convictions .
There is also a commitment to regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations , which are very much essential parts of the stabilisation and association process .
I would like to hear the advocates of an integrated Europe making as much noise as we hear its opponents doing .
With regard to the Europol mandate , it would make more sense if all this was established in general terms , instead of legislation always being drawn up on a case by case basis .
I must reiterate , though , that both the Commission &amp; apos ; s and OLAF &amp; apos ; s reports are covered by the rules on data protection and the protection of the confidentiality of investigations .
There are alternatives - clear and simple alternatives that do , as is intended , reduce the bureaucracy involved in cross @-@ border border service provision .
You see , the Pack@@ aging Directive has already been transposed in widely divergent ways , and incurred different costs , in the individual Member States , rather than leading to the harmonisation that is required .
I would ask the Commission and the Council to take note of the fact that we parliamentarians are capable of more than simply holding debates such as these , which are not always very interesting or exciting , and that the Council and the Commission should in future involve Parliament more in the drafting and also in the implementation of policy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , classi@@ cal case for the EU to prove that it is serious about a common foreign and security policy , for the comprehensive banning of these tests has been signed by all EU Member States .
in writing . - I am voting in favour of Clau@@ dio Fava &amp; apos ; s report on sanctions against employers of illegally staying third @-@ party party nationals .
It is , as it were , a case of three steps forwards and then another one and a half steps back .
I support the compromise .
Together with the Committee on Budgetary Control , Mr van Hulten has done very thorough work , for which I thank you most warmly .
Why is it that some employers &amp; quot ; representatives want these discriminatory restrictions imposed on the citizens of other Member States ?
Mr President , Mr Santer , you have been praised here by one of my colleagues , whom I respect , for making a courageous speech .
And I will happily report back on this discussion to the committee .
Are you also prepared to ensure a stronger representation of women , perhaps ?
Everyone in this House will say , of course Europe is there for the people .
The compromise date of 1 January 2010 is not what we wanted , but at least it is an improvement on the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal , as is the case in many other areas .
Some of what it puts in its answers is ridiculous and I really wish that the President of the Commission , but also the Bureau of Parliament , would make it clear to the Commission that we expect proper answers and indeed answers which stand up in law against the Commission .
I would like to extend very warm thanks to the rapporteur , to the shadow rapporteurs of all the groups , and also to the chairman of the committee , for the great deal of time and effort that they have devoted to this .
We want to amend point 5 of the resolution , which I believe would make it acceptable .
. Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , I believe it is fair to say at this point , only a few weeks before the first of May , the date that has been set for the enlargement of the European Union , that all ten acceding countries have made massive efforts over the past decade to prepare themselves for that day .
Aviation accounts for less than 5 % of the total emissions in the transport sector and in this respect we are to some extent playing token politics here .
A constructive response to it from the European Union is overdue and necessary .
As regards the content , I of course agree with my fellow Members that counter @-@ terrorism terrorism is clearly a state responsibility and clear lines must be drawn here .
The first of the two central themes that I would like to see governing the future administrative development of the House is therefore &amp; apos ; greater trust based on greater transparency &amp; apos ; .
This must lie at the heart of our bilateral relationships .
In addition , regular inspections must be made .
To conclude , I would like to say something so as to avoid any misunderstandings .
I think that this procedure comes very close to what the Member States want , but also what Europe &amp; apos ; s citizens want , which is that a rigorous and efficient budget be adopted each year .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , I urge you to prevent such a failure .
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria !
Europe &amp; apos ; s future cannot remain confined to the market and common currency .
In fact , the decision was also taken to establish measures for development aid in the agricultural policy sector now .
The European Union should therefore be looking to take up the Swedish type of legislation , which links such authori@@ zation to the principle of competition .
Mr President , the Lisbon Strategy is a priority objective for the Council , the Commission , Parliament and ultimately also for the European public up until 2010 .
I would like to thank the Members of this House - Mr Lewandowski , who chaired the working party , Mr Böge , Mr Walter and Mr Mulder - for their efforts at persuasion .
It is therefore imperative to adhere to the aim of limiting global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius above pre @-@ industrial industrial levels .
I believe our statement on the minimum coverage level , which should be adjusted for inflation when the directive is next revised , strikes a balance between the interests of the new Member States and those of the older ones .
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence .
But you can also see that its organiz@@ ational implementation , especially in the administrative domain , still poses problems , even today .
I think we need to be careful about ending up in a situation where all medical products that are at present available over the counter require prescri@@ p@@ tions , because that would certainly create problems for consumers and would impose unreasonable costs on the health system .
We are concerned about the dramatic imbalance in the US economy and the risks that may arise for every other part of the world in the mid to long term as a result .
That is why I felt it was so important for us , as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , to send out a message to the people there . Let us say to them : &amp; apos ; All of us - across party lines - know what you are going through &amp; apos ; .
People &amp; quot ; s worries and problems must , at last , be taken seriously - that is the message that comes over , loud and clear , from the French and Dutch referenda on the Constitution .
Therefore we , the PPE @-@ DE DE Group , move that today &amp; apos ; s vote on the resolution be postponed until the September part @-@ session session because , by then , the facts will have been clarified and we shall know what we are voting on .
We are also calling on the Commission to analyse best practice in the Member States and to learn from it .
I urge the Council and the Commission to adopt measures to achieve these objectives .
I am sure we are all agreed that reliable and specific data are needed if strategies are to be effective and focussed .
Does this procedure of granting facilitation to one population group in Kosovo not run counter to the controversial recognition of Kosovo as a sovereign state ?
We are faced with a major challenge that requires a clear head .
What is presented in this regulation is an over @-@ simplification simplification .
With the tighter provisions envisaged here , I see a risk that the report &amp; apos ; s intention , namely to simplify , will be pursued ad absurdum .
I believe that a good and transparent arrangement has been devised , but I am naturally critical of the statement that this expenditure is to be financed outside Parliament &amp; quot ; s 20 % share of the appropri@@ ation for administrative expenditure .
They deserve respect for having accepted political responsibility for the circumstances described in the independent experts &amp; apos ; report ; and the Commission and its staff also deserve our thanks for the work they have done over the last few years to deepen and broaden European union .
Moreover , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , I too would be very much in favour of the Council discussing what is to be done with this money ; it cannot simply be left to each Member State .
We must recognise this .
Are you prepared to use this extraordinary summit finally to tackle the institutional reform that the Council has dragged out for so long ?
And then you should pass a second resolution , Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , stating that the Heads of State and Government must evaluate structural policy , post haste .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . - Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , thank you for the good cooperation and your report .
Mr President , thank you Commissioner Kovács for your excellent work .
Mr President , I wish to move an oral amendment , with which we want to add emphasis to the demand for enhanced cooperation with the Americans rather than to oppose it in principle .
The way that Mr Su@@ sta , the rapporteur , and all the shadow rapporteurs - and here I would like to thank particularly K@@ ader Ari@@ f from my group - have handled it increased considerably the pre@@ defined scope for Parliament to take action .
We all stand to benefit from that .
Nevertheless , I would like to take this opportunity to mention two points once again .
The vote will take place after the debates .
The fact that it has come to direct talks at all is only because Cyprus has accession prospects and because the Turkish side now understands that the European Union intends to keep to its enlargement timetable .
It is vital to all the interested parties that this round should not fail , but should instead be able to yield gains in prosperity for all WTO members on the basis of clear and unambiguous results .
Who says that we do not also have the right to learn who is travelling into our territory ?
Commissioner , while I am talking about our administrative culture , that of course brings me to the subject of Eurostat .
On that point , I can assure you that that should in fact be the European Union &amp; apos ; s sole objective .
Let me repeat that the Council is prepared to consider the matter if the Commission puts the appropriate proposal before it .
But above all , we need this common European legislation to stop other countries using the EU bu@@ bble as an excuse for running an emissions trading business which saves them the trouble of making any emission reductions themselves , and this at the expense of developing countries who actually need their own reduction quotas .
Europe must be visible in its peripheral areas too , in other aspects of life .
I look forward to cooperating closely with you , Mr Dimas .
It is a fact that any country in Central or Eastern Europe which wishes to do so may become a member of the European Union , as we have agreed here in the House .
However , we would like to press home to the Council that this must not lead to more and more cuts in the amounts available for our traditional external policy measures
This is a convincing example of solidarity .
We must seek cooperation with our colleagues in the Alger@@ ian National Assembly and assist them in continuing the process of democratization in Algeria , which was begun successfully by means of the elections .
We also addressed you on the matter , Mr Commissioner in the Committee for Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy .
I see things the other way around .
The Commission is doing this on its own initiative and because it is right to do so , but it is also doing it because it was called upon to do it .
An@@ s@@ wers to the outstanding questions will be found , in conjunction - I hope - with the associated countries .
1 . Ap@@ pli@@ cation of the Posting of Workers Directive must take priority and the principle of the application of the social legislation of the country of employment must always be regarded as fundamental .
The current debate is about the European Union of the future , be it a Union of 25 or even 27 Member States .
That means that this is a clear case of the EU exceeding its competence , which ultimately makes a proper amendment procedure for the Treaty indispensable .
We must not allow this .
It is our duty to implement this with all the means at our disposal .
This is not the way to conduct politics and take Serbia forward .
And that of course prec@@ lu@@ des catching and selling ju@@ ven@@ ile fish .
The issue of occasionally but obviously excessive fr@@ inge benefits and the reduction of the tax burden on work will be priorities for European economic policy over the coming years .
In addition , there is a specialist committee that should be dealing with the resolution ; it should present us with a motion for a resolution at one of the coming plenary sittings that is properly prepared rather than co@@ b@@ b@@ led together quickly this week .
It is democracy which is being trampled underfoot , which is something which democratically elected governments should avoid if possible !
This also goes to show that , in the Middle East , but also in other comparable regions , only peaceful solutions will bring lasting results .
Now , however , the Council and the Commission are called upon to start up a functional , powerful Agency as quickly as possible .
It pat@@ ron@@ is@@ ingly adds that an Islamic country too can accept and defend these values .
Mr President , I rise to ask a question under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure .
Within the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs we had the support of a large majority for our suggestions for a solid , workable proposal .
If that is the line that the Commission is taking , if that is the spirit motiv@@ ating your working programme , then you have our backing .
That should also be taken into account , as I have often said .
That has to change , which is why I would ask you to travel round the various countries of the Union , make yourself accessible to the public and do what you can to publi@@ ci@@ ze your own existence .
We will present this modified proposal to the Commission before the Council meeting due to take place on 23 November in order to assist the Ministers for Youth in reaching a decision .
Mr President , Mrs De Esteban Martin , in re@@ plying to this supplementary question , I cannot really add anything of substance to what I said a moment ago , namely that the Council takes formal note of all the resolutions approved by Parliament .
There was excellent cooperation between him as the rapporteur for this report and myself as the rapporteur for the 1998 budget .
Our foreign trade policy and our human rights policy need to be joined up ; the same applies to our development policy .
We ask the Commission here quite specifically to observe the clear demarcation of responsibilities both between the EU and the Member States and within the institutions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are indeed having a debate here .
Anyone who does not know what that means would be well advised to come along to the Committee on Petitions , where he would see that our mandate is not to represent one people but rather all the peoples of the European Union .
The problem has also affected the legal supply chain for medicines .
Instead , this needs to be discussed openly with the people of Europe .
The internal market is the foundation stone of our prosperity , and the common currency is a precious political and economic asset .
Commissioner van den Broek , I hope that the European Union will in particular help the independent media - and especially Radi@@ o 92 , which is playing a leading role - to facilitate this democratic process .
In all this , we must not forget that labelling must not dis@@ ori@@ ent the consumer , but must be clear , distinct , and , in the final analysis , legi@@ ble .
The fact that the President of the Commission himself , Mr Santer , has admitted to mistakes reinforces our belief that this Commission is able and willing to do all it can to avoid a re@@ petition of the errors of the past , and to justify the confidence which our chairman Mr Martens expressed in the Commission on behalf of the 15 delegations in the PPE Group .
I see in this a failure to rethink our approach in any discernible way , which is another reason why I reject the report which is the subject of the vote .
If this confusion , this lack of transparency , should give rise to a loss of credibility , then this will not be directed at our financial control procedure but will impact upon the political standing of the European Union .
Mr President , in all the EU &amp; apos ; s key documents , combating poverty is held up as the primary goal of development policy .
Mr Hughes &amp; apos ; s question , too , only involves a vote , if we adopt the same procedure there as we have with many other reports today .
Let me conclude with one further comment : our conflict here in this House is not that we will reject the Damião report tomorrow , but that we will vote differently during the legislative process .
The tabled amendments refine the draft further , making it clearer and more up to date .
The Presidency is working towards ensuring that the emissions trading scheme makes the expected contribution to the achievement of the Kyoto objectives , and is working to improve and extend this EU scheme with a view to establishing a global carbon market that leads to the emission reductions needed to tackle climate change .
With regard to institutional issues , it should be made clear at the summit that enhanced cooperation cannot be used as an excuse for failing to introduce proper extension of qualified majority voting .
Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the European Parliament has had more responsibility and more legislative work .
I believe we have done something good .
They are necessary if we are to be able to maintain extensive farming .
At the same time , we have to exercise our political imagination to seek a solution to the problem .
Unless we establish a reliable legal framework which is as informative and transparent as it could possibly be , not to mention liability for the benefit of the consumer , it will not be possible to complete the single market ...
The Commission &amp; quot ; s treatment and assessment of Croatia &amp; quot ; s progress will send a signal to the entire region .
That is why our question to the Commission includes points that we have identified in conversation with the people affected .
It is to your credit that you have encouraged the spread of social democracy . This is good for the European Parliament , which has moved to the left .
This seems to me to be an important issue and it will certainly be difficult to do this in such a way that flexibility is not lost .
I therefore see the Green Paper on the creation of a European public prosecutor as showing the way ahead .
Partnership and subsidiarity are the hallmark of the Parliament and Commission proposals .
For these reasons I abstained from voting during the plenary session of the European Parliament .
We must not abandon this country , which has so many friends in Europe .
I have difficulties with some of the amendments tabled .
The citizens would not understand it if we simply held a debate without then saying what proposed solutions and options the European Union can offer .
I hope that these proposals will result in us being able to systematically resolve the problems that remain in this area following previous efforts , including those of Mr Gau@@ z@@ ès and the previous Commission and the Council - for which we are grateful ; and that we are able to do so without creating a new monopoly , but rather by consistently getting to grips with the problems of incentives and regulation .
As I said though , we still have a lot of work to do .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily the Liberals have included it in a proposed amendment .
Even now , we are not completely satisfied with the communication from the Commission .
My fellow Member sitting next to me has made a very good comment .
We need to ask ourselves two questions .
I therefore join the rapporteur in hoping that this own @-@ initiative initiative report will be adopted tomorrow with a genuinely convincing majority , since it has already received so much support in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Affairs .
We want and need enlargement as our next great step forward .
I therefore support the adoption of Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 .
We must finally put an end to this process .
I am very pleased that we have also been called upon to comment on the implications of policies .
That must not happen here .
As a rule these will be sectoral and national guidelines which are to be drawn up by many interested parties .
As for Turkey , about which Mr Wiersma will have more to say , while it must discharge its obligations , we too have an integration task yet to perform on Cyprus , and that is something we have to do .
In this report , the Commission too has expressed admi@@ rable intentions in the form of fine words .
Fifteen years ago , if people in the European Union - in whatever country - had the feeling that something was going wrong , that some long @-@ established established national standard was endangered , they responded by looking to Europe to put things right ; they felt the need to rectify matters in the European framework , because people believed then that European rules in a European framework would provide protection transc@@ ending national boundaries .
I have another question , though , in this connection . We all know that the citizens of the Union have a right to security , meaning that they expect the Union to ensure that EUROPOL does eventually come fully into force .
There is a real problem here , as Alexander Radwan has outlined .
Here , then , there are divergent tendencies ; we may well have our misgivings in one case , but in this one we are on your side in that we would like to see the EU &amp; quot ; s standards maintained in third countries .
I do not want to close without extending very warm thanks to the services - both the committee &amp; apos ; s and those of the groups - for their contribution to the production of the report , and also to the shadow rapporteurs , Mr Mon@@ tor@@ o Rom@@ ero , Mrs in &amp; apos ; t Veld , Mrs Rühle and Mrs Wa@@ gen@@ kne@@ cht , whose excellent cooperation has made it possible to present a unanimous report .
I personally find it most regrettable that the Commission commissioned this study so late .
The European Union is often the most important contributor to financing de @-@ mining mining actions , and international actions are carried out in the relevant countries .
It is dependent upon multilateral cooperation , global responsibility and upon our thinking along Community @-@ oriented oriented lines rather than nation@@ alis@@ tically .
Perhaps , Commissioner , there is one thing that I should point out .
It is also in both regions &amp; apos ; interests for progress to be made on security for their people and mankind in general .
As you said , the situation down there has to improve .
It expresses our fullest support and makes clear that we are absolutely committed to establishing democracy and human rights , especially the rights of Afghan women and children .
Fourthly , we need a strong Commission with a strong President .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my heartfelt thanks and respect are o@@ wed to the rapporteur , who has drafted this material with much energy , discipline and intelligence .
We need a fresh start .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I quite agree that following the launch of the euro we need a more closely coordinated economic policy .
What is happening here is dangerous , very dangerous .
Does this not then mean that in the car manufacturing sector in particular we are posi@@ tioning Europe as the market that now has the most demanding legislation and that we are therefore specifically creating a lead market for efficient motor cars , even allowing for environmental constraints and oil supply problems ?
We must develop an environment and climate pact .
What Parliament has been calling for for years , this regulation is now bringing to pass .
In another 12 proposed amendments I can see what your concerns are but the Commission is unable to accept these amendments .
Mr President , I would like to say something about the Rules of Procedure which I think is very important given that the MEP , when she asked for a quorum , cited that it is her right under the Rules of Procedure .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Kor@@ ak@@ as , and to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the report and for their thorough examination of the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal .
I hope that will be reviewed in plenary .
In any case , these costs should be within sensible and comprehensible limits .
I should like to thank all the speakers who wrote home calling for the necessary steps to be taken at long last .
I should therefore like to stress that the report as it now stands - thanks once again to Mrs De Esteban - is very much in line with my group &amp; apos ; s ideas and is something that we can broadly subscribe to .
Firstly , environmental protection is essential for sustainable urban development and the inclusion of this aspect should therefore be a general requirement for a project to receive funding .
Overall , it is to be welcomed that the Committee on the Environment did not accept the doubtless well @-@ intentioned intentioned proposals from the rapporteur , on the grounds I referred to above .
It is practicable ; it has a significant effect on our chances in the internal market and on the public &amp; quot ; s opportunities .
I think that is an important political point .
The protection of fundamental rights must be guaranteed in this regard .
In the end , however , the consumer must also play his part .
This report has been adopted unanimously in committee and will therefore be supported by all groups .
There is nothing more to stop us going ahead with European political union at full steam .
This follows on seam@@ lessly from the Muscat report , and also from yesterday &amp; apos ; s debate in committee - in which the Commissioner also participated .
These questions need to be answered .
We have to stop the UK rebate and we really have to know where we stand in terms of our political objectives , but obviously we also need to agree a budget .
Another subject , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , is Turkey .
I can only say that this version of the directive as it stands in the common position also fully reflects the wishes of my group .
However , it is not the job of the legislator to criticise this .
To that I would say : the flexibility reserve is an instrument available to us for financing an un@@ foreseen task in a particular year .
What will we do then ?
As you know , I regard the putting of questions as a fundamental parliamentary right .
We can , though , do a lot if we are willing to motivate these countries to get stuck into this .
Consider@@ ation must be given to the repercussions on structural policy , on the common agricultural policy , and on the institutions of the European Union .
Three countries so far have opened up their labour markets to the EU &amp; quot ; s new Member States , and their experiences of it have been positive .
We have neither the money , nor the legal basis , nor the powers to do that .
The EU undoubtedly has a great responsibility in the area of international trade in the agricultural sector , particularly in respect of developing countries .
This situation cannot be tolerated by the European Union any longer .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s demands for statistics that are comparable and of a high quality are , therefore , legitimate and understandable , and should be supported by Parliament .
So I would ask you to investigate this matter and inform us of the results .
But our Parliament has tied this aid to certain conditions and now we have to ensure that these conditions are met .
It bears witness to this country &amp; apos ; s desire to become a member of euro@@ land , spar@@ ing no effort along the way .
The Commission is more than willing to do this , and will indeed do so .
On the whole , it is a balanced compromise , and I ask all my fellow Members to endorse it .
Although true , that is only half the truth .
Therefore , the admission of Turkey would lead for a variety of reasons to a qualitative change in the European Union and to an inevitable standstill in European efforts for integration .
Here and now , I appeal to the leadership of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to do all they can to persuade the people on the island that the plan we have now represents the best and fai@@ rest solution that can be achieved .
Unfortunately , that has proved impossible .
That is why we have also submitted proposals to that effect .
To conclude , may I say , on behalf of the Commission , that , unfortunately , we are repeatedly having to insti@@ gate infringement proceedings against Member States in matters of environmental law , and there is a large number of infringement proceedings pending in this self @-@ same same sector .
Instead , on 19 December , at the European Union &amp; apos ; s initiative , and for the first time ever , a unilateral declaration against the death penalty was put to the General Assembly , and it is important to note that it was supported by 85 states from all parts of the globe .
I actually believe that the Environment Committee &amp; apos ; s motion for a resolution does not go far enough .
I also extend warm and sincere thanks to the former Presidents who are with us today :
On the other hand , however , the option of abortion must be left open .
Mr President , I should like to put a comment to the Commissioner .
They too will have to tell us how we are to handle it and how we are to pay for it .
I do , though , thank you for your understanding , Mr President .
A vote will be taken on the amendments tomorrow .
Th@@ ought must therefore be given to the measures the European Union can take to put Mr Lukaschenko in his place .
in writing . - In principle , we all agree that we need better energy efficiency and more rational energy transmission and that the expansion of renewables is important .
That is why the Commission has taken the initiative and , I would emphasise , is quite right to do so .
This report is an attempt to find a solution to the problem of globalisation , a problem that the EU has itself created .
That is something else to pon@@ der .
There is no provision for such a body either in the Treaty of Lisbon , the Euratom Treaty or in the establishment plan for the Commission .
Because we want a strong Europe and need a strong Commission , we had no option but to express our lack of confidence in this Commission .
We expect that Belgium , Greece , Ireland , Italy , the Netherlands , Austria and Sweden will shortly announce similar measures .
The national parliaments will , of course , be marginalised .
In any case , this change and new technologies have definitely enabled us to improve the air quality and indeed this point has been made in the report as well .
Of course , the competence lies with the Member States here , but the European Union also has a responsibility for the de@@ population of these regions ; this is happening because of what we face throughout the European Union , namely liberalisation .
I therefore strongly endorse the resolution of this House that expressly calls on the Commission and the Member States to tackle the growing problem of antibio@@ tic resistance amongst animals in a responsible way .
Even so , the EU will have to do a great deal to keep it that way .
In the case of discrimination against women in Kuwait and Afghanistan , it is the right to civil equality .
We are also prepared to make a contribution and provide help .
The control systems of the common fisheries policy and their implementation are particularly important .
What we are discussing here today is how the Commission can escape the threat of non @-@ discharge discharge as well as - and this , ladies and gentlemen , is the key issue - the question of political responsibility .
This agreement does not bring about the progress needed in relations between Europe and Mexico , nor is it a suitable model for similar agreements to be concluded in the future , for example with Mercosur .
Instead of ad hoc sanctions being imposed , I would like an EU strategy resulting in a coherent and sustainable sanctions policy .
We also pay tribute to his considerable efforts to find a compromise solution .
The old Customs Code already included the possibility of closer cooperation , and so this possibility is already being used in practice .
Let me point out that I will take the opportunity to discuss these proposals at the next meeting with the Member States &amp; apos ; representatives concerned with financial control .
The K@@ 3 convention goes a step further , however , in that it conduc@@ ts this limitation of citizens &amp; apos ; legal rights by means of an international agreement .
I simply wanted to ask why Question Time ended before 7@@ .00 p@@ m today .
We would like to thank the Committee on Budgets for the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed so far and we hope that this will continue .
Even if open coordination is not specifically mentioned as a particularly suitable policy tool for these areas of policy , that cannot dis@@ guise the fact that the procedure that will continue to apply is that based on objectives and guidelines whose implementation by the Member States is subject to scrutiny at European level .
We must set standards here .
That is the direction we should take .
These irregularities relate mainly to excessive payments and the incorrect use of funds .
Whilst we are responding in political terms to this challenge by creating a single European sky , we still need greater capacity at our over@@ stretched airports .
We would like to see them do that , because they will be welcome in the European Union .
Promoting low carbon energy sources is a well @-@ known known argument used by the nuclear lobby to take the sting out of nuclear power .
It is my hope that all this agreement will give us the necessary stimulus to at last bring about in reality what we owe to the public - a greater degree of security even when enlargement has taken place .
But as soon as they reach a positive conclusion , we in the Commission will lose no time in bringing forward a proposal , and at that stage the normal decision @-@ making making process will begin - in other words , the Commission will submit a proposal to the Standing Veterin@@ ary Committee .
What ideas are there circul@@ ating within the Commission about the introduction of a degree of flexibility here ?
Unfortunately , she had not obtained a majority for it at that time .
. - Madam President , I should like to give the following reply to the questions regarding the TEN , the trans @-@ European European networks .
With his departure , however , political decisions have once more been taken in Slovakia which give us cause for concern .
However , I would like to say once again very clearly that the world , including our partners in the United States , China and other places , is watching the European Union , the Council , the Commission and Parliament to see how we will react to the crisis .
Let me reiterate , though , that the approach to be adopted must be that of enabling people to establish freedom and democracy in their own countries , without feeling that these have been imposed upon them .
Is it really justifiable to celebrate the fact that we all want Europe to cost us less in the future as one of the most successful conclusions of Berlin at a time when we are all rightly calling for more European integration in employment , structural reform in general , the EU enlargement process , and solidarity for the wider Europe ?
Anyone approaching this issue with a serious mind knows that North Korea may well be very dangerous , but that it calls for responses that differ from those appropriate to Iraq .
So from the point of view of the Committee on External Economic Relations I can therefore propose that we approve the Council &amp; apos ; s common position in the case of Romania too .
The rapporteur writes , &amp; apos ; For the consumer affor@@ dability is a key issue .
I believe we must give a great deal of attention to ensuring that it does not do so .
There is a chance for them to become a model of best practice for European regional cooperation , that is true , but this is likely to take many years .
Madam President , we , too , advocate the accession of the Western Balkans to the European Union and , of course , also that of Serbia .
( The sitting was suspended at 3.@@ 45 p.m. and resumed at 4@@ .30 p.m. )
If it turns out to be necessary , we will have to carry out a wholesale revision of European law on medicines .
We need a common migration policy , not just a common deportation policy .
This has to stop !
After all , the talks have only just begun and still have a long way to go .
A transitional solution will only waste valuable time .
The action plan for biomass and the EU biofuels strategy involved us having communications submitted to us , which were discussed in depth and taken forward by the Council as appropriate .
I see today as an important day for democracy , and an important day for Europe .
Last week &amp; apos ; s proposal strikes me as scandalous .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Madam President , I am one of the few people here in this Chamber who was present when President Sad@@ at gave his fam@@ ous speech in the European Parliament .
It is not enough to try to make the over@@ burdened bureaucracy more efficient .
I would accordingly like to thank the Commission and the Council for having addressed in their paper and in today &amp; apos ; s debate something that Europe urgently needs : a wide @-@ ranging ranging public debate on this very issue , the geographical expansion of Europe , not of the continent of Europe , but of close political cooperation within the European Union .
That is why it is important to lay down again certain benchmarks against which we have to measure all collective claim procedures .
The recognition of that occupational group must be taken further , and another task on the agenda will be to cut emissions and to make aviation less harmful to the climate than it has been to date .
If we squ@@ ander this potential , we cannot be surprised when many people in Europe see the decisions taken in Brussels or Strasbourg more as interference in their internal affairs than as forward @-@ looking looking action .
Furthermore , I believe it is urgently necessary to take into account different consumer preferences in the EU .
I think one of them is certainly the ageing of our European societies .
For citizens , it must be comprehensible and explicable and , above all , it must also be economically feasible for them .
That does not make it easy , but the people on the spot , the administrative bodies , are trying to find answers , some of them on the basis of structural assistance from the European Union .
All accession criteria must definitely be met , but Serbia is a European country and should become part of the Union .
The Council and the Commission must do their bit to achieve this .
For that reason , our group will also be supporting the discharge recommendation .
There must be a political response to this in the form of new rules to improve consumer safety .
This applies equally to all candidate countries , and so it also applies to Turkey .
Mr President , I was in the Chair on Wednesday evening when this debate took place , and I arranged on Wednesday evening for a check on whether the vote would be held today or not .
It seems that at present we do not have the courage to admit to ourselves that the role of the European Union in international relations is undoubtedly at risk because of this .
It is the current ban on growing and importing GMOs that for years has cut off Europe &amp; apos ; s scientific community , its consumers and farmers from the positive developments in the field of green genetic engineering .
After we had already discussed the legal basis for this decision , and also raised appropriate objections to it , to which we received no response from the Commission , this House decided yesterday to agree to the Commission &amp; apos ; s legislative proposal and then passed a resolution rejecting the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal .
That is a point that must be addressed head @-@ on on , for much of what you have said we Social Democrats can agree with .
That is the Council &amp; apos ; s position .
I also think more use needs to be made of the opportunities afforded by schools , which would , if appropriate , involve modi@@ fying cur@@ ricul@@ a .
Regu@@ lar commercial abuse of the Internet is one of the unfortunate realities of cy@@ ber@@ space that cannot be ignored .
I ask myself what the Intergovernmental Conference is actually doing in this area .
We must wiel@@ d this instrument with far more determination and vigour . Indeed , in my view , the greater our resolution in influencing the passage of European legislation on environmental matters , the greater our credibility will be in Johannesburg and , of course , at future conferences too .
I would , therefore , like to thank the rapporteur for his extremely critical comments in the report on the involvement of Parliament , especially in the explanatory statement .
We do not need more planned economy in the European Union ; others have failed on that front before .
I cannot go along with that .
Let me therefore ask once again : given that the Council cannot agree on this extremely important matter , and given that there is a blocking minority , can the Commission not decide to set the subject aside until the Council has reached agreement ?
I consider it imperative that we achieve a political solution and a cease @-@ fire fire on this basis .
Nevertheless I consider the report to be justified and voted positively .
But they must be simple solutions .
I agree with many others that , at all events , we must strengthen and make use of Europol and Eurojust .
It is also important , particularly at a time when the implementation of the Reform Treaty is under discussion , to re @-@ emphasise emphasise that Parliament remains firmly committed to budgetary discipline and that it will not exceed the limit of 20 % of heading 5 as long as the present situation continues .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have drawn up a major resolution which covers a number of themes .
In addition , the EU already imposes very heavy taxes , charges and environmental requirements on other modes of transport such as buses , railways and even cars .
I cannot imagine that from a security perspective , and especially in view of the difficult situation with Iran , this agreement could possibly gain Europe &amp; apos ; s backing .
Mr President , I should like to extend my warmest thanks to Mr Sacconi for his excellent work . Unfortunately , however , I have to say that I take a rather less optimistic view than him of the compromise on registration we have before us .
Let us take a look at ourselves here in the European Union .
It is to achieve a balanced system .
It has become clear from the discussion where we must start with our work .
Therefore , no democrat can vote in favour of such a text .
That is what the people of Europe - and also the international community - expect from us .
To my mind , this is a very problematic situation and is the reason why it is urgently necessary that we should make every effort to facilitate the establishment of the rule of law and of democracy under a strong and guaranteed central power that also takes account of ethnic differences and of diversity .
Taking that into consideration - and when it was financial issues that were at stake , we urged you to be flexible - the Pol@@ es and the others have almost reached the state of debate with which we are familiar in the European Union of today .
That standardisation will make it possible for European manufacturers to compete with manufacturers in third countries under the same conditions .
Once again an attempt is being made to undermine existing GMO legislation , in this case the call for special labelling for novel foods which come from animals that have been fed genetically modified feed@@ stuffs .
Instead , the spirit of Nice clearly amoun@@ ted to wondering how to block , how to intergovernment@@ alise , how to be f@@ eted at home as the def@@ ender of national interests , rather than how to take the European Union forward .
According to the Commission &amp; apos ; s explanation , on the one hand genetic modification procedures must be applied responsibly , and on the other hand the increase in scientific knowledge and findings in the last 10 years must be taken into account .
We will simply have to wait and see .
I believe that the approach taken to this report is a model for the parliamentary work in this House .
You also told the European region of the International Les@@ bian and Ga@@ y Association ( IL@@ G@@ A ) that the Commission would analyse this text and explain what its next steps would be .
Alongside changes in the law , there need to be real changes on the ground through the way the law is interpreted in Turkey .
Finally , I would specifically like to thank the Conciliation Committee secretariat for its excellent groundwork .
If we had an EU @-@ wide wide breast screening programme , we could save the lives of 31 000 women in the EU a year , help to reduce healthcare costs and substantially reduce subsequent costs for the whole of society .
Precisely because it is a small piece of legislation , though highly political and with the potential to intru@@ de extensively into people &amp; quot ; s private and business affairs , this Parliament has wisely and rightly decided to ask in earnest what needs regulation , what is worth regulating and what constitutes an appropriate response .
I think that will be fu@@ n enough , so we can afford ourselves the luxury tomorrow of having a discussion that will provide us with the necessary information .
As a Parliament , we now have an extremely difficult decision before us with respect to Category 4 .
Just the opposite in fact , I wish to call on the Belgian Presidency and the Commission to contribute to further coordination in this area , by taking advantage of the fact that stability programmes can be updated .
In addition , it is high time the European Union had these things checked by inspectors .
The European Parliament , the national parliaments and networks must therefore become more closely involved .
I believe that is the purpose of this agreement , but in that case , we also want it to be enacted as an appropriate law .
Secondly , a reduction in the economic and social divergences in the Member States .
Progress to an exceptional extent and at an exceptional rate in the globalisation of real activity now makes further development of this multilateral body of regulations , which was based on GATT and is now the World Trade Organisation , the WTO , imperative .
At the same time , we know that the United States , China and the A@@ PEC countries , which together are responsible for two thirds of the world &amp; apos ; s CO2 emissions , take a very critical stance on this issue .
That is our position where codecision , subsidiarity and adequate provision for services of general interest are concerned , and we will not accept anything to the contrary .
That destroys the credibility of you all !
Mr President , I would like to make an announcement and ask for your support .
- Mr President , I am in complete agreement with what Mrs Bo@@ z@@ kur@@ t said .
We need to do this not only for environmental reasons , but also for reasons of economic policy .
Let me be very frank about the results of the Council .
We must obviously take other steps together with the Commission .
But we do expect that the results will not only be made available to representatives of the social dialogue but also of course to the European Parliament .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I regard this amendment of the Directive on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs as a step in the right direction on a long road .
Thirdly , to environmental protection and the conservation of energy resources by reducing un@@ laden journeys .
The numerous proposed amendments are proof of the interest which this report has generated .
Report ( A5 @-@ 03@@ 39 03@@ 39 / 2000 ) by Mrs Lalumière , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the establishment of a common European security and defence policy after Cologne and Helsinki &amp; # 91 ; 2000 / 2005 ( IN@@ I ) &amp; # 93 ;
Let me conclude with two further brief comments .
We have made it a political precondition for the conclusion of the enlargement negotiations for such strategies to exist and be in force .
This is why we support all reasonable efforts to ensure that energy is used efficiently .
The other point is respect for mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism , for cultural diversity in our society , and I do believe that in some regions , languages spoken by migrants are also part of this cultural environment .
It was against this background that we created a regulation concerning third countries which is clearly contrary to the Geneva Convention but also does not do anything to combat abuse .
Nevertheless , I think that things are heading in the right direction , and to respect the I@@ IA , a decision needs to be taken by 1 May .
I will just ask the following of the ladies and gentlemen in the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . This House envisages that politicians of the same political orientation join together in a group - how can the PPE @-@ DE DE &amp; apos ; s people actually sit together with such a man in the same group ?
It is very important that we place greater emphasis on the quality of the work with the regions , particularly when we look at some countries that are experiencing genuine structural problems .
The further development of synergy in the Black Sea region is significant not just for energy strategy reasons .
In principle , however , the PPE @-@ DE DE Group is in favour of amendment .
Up until now , this information has not been available to us in any detail .
The Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States are working together on this at EU level .
This was done once before , in 1998 , and the policy measures were clearly defined in the report .
We understand a European social model to mean that the public must be guaranteed these services , and that is why they are not primarily a political task for the Commission , but a matter for local and regional authorities .
We have received several requests for the debates on breaches of human rights .
Fifthly , we in the European People &amp; apos ; s Party believe that the rationale of European unification demands the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union .
We have spoken a great deal about enlargement over the past months .
Please allow me therefore to name some of the most important points .
The European Parliament has made a very important contribution in this respect , and I should like to thank you most sincerely again on behalf of the Presidency for your extraordinarily rapid treatment of the revised draft .
We can apply the specific safety measures provided for in the Treaty of Accession ; we can institute normal infringement proceedings ; we can make use of administrative interventions .
I said at the outset that the Commission regards the adoption of the proposal as a milestone on the road that leads to a common European asylum system .
We shall have to tackle the problems at their roots if we wish to resolve them and revive the world economy .
If necessary , we will have to curtail the speaking times tomorrow or keep strictly to them , so as to be able to start voting at 11.@@ 30 a.m .
My group will therefore be voting against mentioning this principle .
I also found that the Parliamentary delegation very much got its act together during the conciliation and has finished by submitting a very good proposal .
It is commendable that the new Macedonian democracy has made further progress in all areas of society and business .
Pro@@ ducing and util@@ ising fuels derived from biomass is a political and economic alternative to importing oil .
Iran is naturally an important player in the Middle East .
I believe this really is the way to make constructive progress in this certainly very difficult situation we find ourselves in with reference to the future agreement with Morocco .
To that extent I find the compromise just about acceptable .
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , I am disappointed at your answer to my question .
We too support both reports and congratulate our colleagues .
Her amendments are a step in the right direction .
Mr President , thank you , Commissioner , for your very precise reply .
Qu@@ ality must become an even greater focus in agriculture , and this applies to farm imports from third countries as well , which must conform to the same standards as those applicable to EU producers .
That is why we called for this debate and why we are asking to be properly included in the discussion in future .
Mr President of the Commission , where is the Commission &amp; apos ; s White Paper on European democracy ?
What do these figures tell us ?
To that end we need intelligent solutions , and we need network security , for security is paramount .
In this area as well , it is quite crucial that in the interests of Europe , a new culture of responsibility takes shape in the Council itself .
I believe , however , that there is also more that the governments must do , and I support the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s report .
I can support most of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &amp; apos ; Rights .
In this agreement , there is already an effective instrument for carrying on a permanent dialogue with our Russian partners about all those questions of a political and economic nature which are central to our mutual relationship .
The Republic of Austria sees great difficulties in implementing what is to apply in future and the citizens will find the new rules hard to live with .
We particularly welcome the fact that the Commission gives a positive assessment of the results of the Copenhagen study that was commissioned by the Commission itself .
However , I would like to strengthen one demand , and that is the demand that in its next report the Commission should devote a special section to reporting on the measures which it has adopted in response to criticisms voiced by Parliament in previous years .
Yesterday , with the &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; in the Czech Senate , we took a huge step forward .
I am formulating these doubts so as to afford the Commission the opportunity to dispel some of them in a concrete and constructive manner at the revision stage .
These self @-@ st@@ y@@ led st@@ y@@ led hol@@ y wars have further victims : religious and ethnic minorities , the politically active and intelle@@ ctu@@ als .
Any eco @-@ balance balance sheet must , in my opinion , include an economic evaluation of biofuels , which must be compared with conventional ones .
At this point , Commissioner , I must also say that this year , we dealt very circum@@ spec@@ tly with the Commission &amp; apos ; s administration budget , but that does not have to be the case every year .
In other words , it depends on how we spend the money .
I would like to single out what in my view is the most important point .
If both sides want to escape eventual destruction and give their children a chance , then they must now come to an agreement , and we too should make our contribution towards achieving this .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , was it not us , was it not the European Parliament that wanted to have an independent European Food Safety Authority ?
Then Albanians and Serbs will at last have to see that they can only govern the country together and that they will only be able to join Europe together , in a country where they have made peace and live together peacefully .
Here we are looking , above all , at the possibilities offered by mechan@@ ical land@@ mine clearance .
My main request to the Commission , but also indirectly to the Council of Ministers , is : please reach an agreement at last !
I want to use the seconds remaining to me just to ask the Commission for something .
The euro , moreover , puts to the test the ability of Europeans to organise unity in the interests of all Europe &amp; apos ; s states .
Commissioner , I will be quite frank : we will not allow our role to be reduced to that of an optional extra !
It should be made clear in this regard that in carrying out a range of duties , with this comes full responsibility .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , that is a bit of a problem .
The commitment Mr Corbett has shown , both in committee and together with other Members of this House , to bringing about changes in this area is indeed admi@@ rable .
The 2012 European budget must also make a contribution in this area .
I think that as Europeans , we face an enormous task : to respond as quickly as we can and do our utmost to play a positive role in this conflict in order to give these countries a future .
The conciliation procedure was a real pleasure .
This programme contributes a great deal to mutual understanding .
For these reasons , I have rejected the proposal for the Commission @-@ designate designate made up in this way .
What a short @-@ sighted sighted strategy on the part of the Commission !
I am therefore of the opinion that we should use today to bring this procedure back to Parliament .
I think that the achievement of our very intensive discussions over recent weeks and months has been that the Commission has guided onto a sensible track Parliament &amp; apos ; s justified concerns and the political possibilities in the Council .
If we make empty promises , then the 20 million unemployed will be given no hope , and everyone else will make us aware of how they have become more - rather than less - dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted with Europe .
If we intend to do that , we must pledge ourselves to certain important principles , so that we at least , as elected representatives of the peoples of Europe , can restore the credibility which NATO has for@@ fei@@ ted through this and similar ep@@ iso@@ des .
I think he is right ; the Commission &amp; apos ; s behaviour is certainly remarkable , to put it politely .
The message that gives is that this House is not able to make objective decisions on behalf of the public .
Norm@@ ally , under similar circumstances , we give money to other countries that are not ruled democratically .
If I remember rightly , I have already explained , in the debate on the subject , the importance of transatlantic dialogue and what the European Union and also the Council Presidency have contributed to that debate .
I am sure that the European Parliament will do so .
I believe it is useful to remember where we were some time ago .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have just discussed this problem a short while ago .
The reform also needs to incorporate a change at ministerial level .
We should also make clear that no one outside the candidate countries and the European Union has any influence over European Union enlargement .
We do not have to be ashamed of the achievements of this European Union , and we should also tell people about this success if we want their support for the EU - although they are entitled to criticise the EU in individual cases .
The public sector should set an example in the central and eastern European and in the other candidate countries .
Mr President , the report contains important conditions for future candidate countries , thereby granting human rights problems the same status as economic conditions .
We must not turn away bo@@ ats full of refugees as we have done in the past .
That is why we need to act quickly and determin@@ edly for patient planet E@@ ar@@ th .
But I am certain that monetary union needs the acceptance of citizens to be successful .
This Israeli Government , whose approval ratings lie around the 3 % mark , is doing Hamas a favour by trying to wi@@ pe out the source of the attacks by military means , leading to more Palestinian victims , whose deaths we l@@ ament .
If the Commission were to abandon its dogmatic position on the Common Market Organisation , it could surely agree to the regulation providing for the purely statistical supervision of syn@@ thetic alcohol .
Mr President , Europe is , after all , about unity in diversity , and so I would like to put the following question .
We in the Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party would like to see Parliament get back to legally enforceable rights , discussing actual human rights abuses and calling for respect for human rights in cases where the path of human rights has been abandoned .
Racism and xenophobia are a serious problem throughout the Union and one that must be taken seriously .
All of this illegally acquired money is , however , la@@ under@@ ed and put into circulation in the legal economy .
We also need significantly greater investment in people , to improve general education and specialist training levels .
I am able to inform you that I have invited the Member States , the business associations , the consumers &amp; quot ; groups , the trade unions and all members of the European public to submit their own proposals to us , and these have been coming in in their hundreds , many of them very detailed and very precise .
The European Union &amp; apos ; s regions are significantly handicapped in their cohesion and in their development as democracies by the continuing under @-@ representation representation of women in decision @-@ making making processes .
It holds out very interesting prospects of reducing the burden of energy costs on small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises and of contributing towards self @-@ sufficiency sufficiency in energy supply in Third World countries as well .
In my opinion , it is right for there to be an inter@@ val of time between publication and the debate here in this House , so that all Members are able to famili@@ arise themselves with the full report beforehand .
I want to ask if the Presidency is aware of the importance Parliament attaches to this issue , and of Parliament &amp; apos ; s intention to re@@ submit this motion at second reading stage .
In addition , the Commission is empowered to negotiate on behalf of both the Community and its Member States on the liberalisation of direct investments outside the service sector in the framework of talks with non @-@ EU EU countries concerning free trade agreements .
I would now like to say a few words about the action plan on the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice .
In the view of my group , this is also a compelling reason for us to reject all the amendments that have been tabled in the intervening period for the reading in plenary .
I recommend to you , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , that you invite the President of Parliament to Brussels for the whole of the summit .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we already mentioned some of the priorities of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy for the 2003 Budget in our debate two weeks ago .
What we need is an optim@@ isation in terms of fundamental rights , which means a political analysis to ascertain which of the various solutions that weigh up these interests correctly produces the best balance between determination of the objective and restriction of fundamental rights .
Parliament ought to express its condemnation of this act of terrorism in no uncertain terms , because terrorism can never be justified .
The European Union is making progress in the fight against serious crime .
We have always said that our strategy was twofold , namely gender mainstreaming in all policy areas and separate EU@@ spon@@ so@@ red programmes to promote women &amp; quot ; s interests , until such a time as equal opportunities become a reality .
Bes@@ t practice approaches will help us all benefit from an exchange of experience and devise effective measures to combat the problem .
This would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement with the Council in the conciliation procedure , whether it be on 75 % or whatever .
However , I would like to say quite clearly that at a regional level , the success of the cohesion policy lies in its proximity to local economic problems .
Is it co@@ in@@ cidental that at the moment doubts are increasing again about the effectiveness of current climate models , which are being created at enormous cost throughout the World ?
So what do we mean by saying that we know that we must unite Europe not so much against a return to the past but far more to master the tasks of the future ?
The free movement of people or services must be on the agenda .
As the amendments originally submitted to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs showed , people &amp; apos ; s views on how precisely the funding principles should be implemented can diverge widely .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is another subject on which the discussion very quickly reveals that strong emotions are involved , on the one hand , but also stark realities on the other .
Those who use port services , for example ship@@ pers and the business sectors that produce and ship goods , believe - and I think they are right to do so - that market access requires a European regulation .
We are agreed that , before the European Union is enlarged to include new States , there must be a basic reform to maintain the efficiency of the European Union and also , I would say , to improve the transparency of decisions on European policy and the ability to supervise these .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s proposed negotiating mandate for such an agreement is good and points us in the right direction .
That the Council has not , however , dealt with the European Parliament &amp; quot ; s concern - namely the Strasbourg question - this is , to put it bluntly , a disappointment .
Commissioner , that was addressed to you . G@@ o to it , and do it well !
This is therefore a decision under Article 190 ( 5 ) . Nevertheless , as far as taxes are concerned , we are open to the Council &amp; apos ; s proposal that an additional national tax should be introduced for a limited number of Member States .
This is an opportunity that we must take advantage of .
I hope that Mr Elles is willing to move with us in this direction and create common European defence structures one step at a time .
With this point of view and in the light of the decision by the European Council concerning the competence of the Agency , agreements should be reached which , in time , achieve reconciliation throughout the Balkans and tie the region into the Stability Pact .
This is why the action plans adopted jointly with our partner states as part of the European neighbourhood policy contain very comprehensive chapters on cooperation in the domains of justice and home affairs .
We need bold democrats and in this new period we urgently need an exciting , democratic and genuinely effective Europe .
Since we l@@ ament the failure to involve the public , let at least their representatives have the right to be present at negotiations and consulted - if no more than that - while they are in progress , for it is we , at the end of the day , who have to explain them to the electorate .
That is why I feel that the interim report that has been tabled is acceptable to all .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , in all the initiatives that the Council is taking in respect of Kosovo , will the views of Serbia and the information it provides also be adequately taken into account ?
An important and completely undisputed point is also strengthening the rights of defence of those who are involved in investigations .
Mr President , Commissioner , many thanks for your speech and for the Green Paper , the details of which we are still not familiar with .
rapporteur . - Mr President , if I may begin with the last point , namely the transposition period , let me say that this directive sets a precedent .
On a final note though , I would like to mention two phenomena not directly associated with the European Union but with the world climate .
I would like to address one thing that makes it clear that it is self @-@ evidently evidently in our own strategic interest if the European Union acts as one in foreign policy matters , while also making clear that solidarity can be manifes@@ ted also in smaller matters such as , for example , the issue of trade with Poland .
However , Parliament is something of a different k@@ ettle of fish to the Commission in my view .
Both the in@@ exhaus@@ tible benefits that keep being cited and the unresolved adverse side @-@ effects effects makes one thing clear : the European Union must rapidly take account of this head@@ long development .
In these areas , Europe is indeed the largest donor .
The question of whether GMOs are a good or a bad thing does not belong in today &amp; apos ; s debate .
I want to express my sympathy to the family members affected , but also to those who , in the space of just a few hours , lost everything that they had spent their lives building up .
First of all , I would like to thank you , Mr Gallagher , for your report on the extension of the fisheries agreement under discussion until the end of the year .
And I would like to have an answer this evening !
I hope this happens as it is the only chance to help the people .
We will be monitoring the conduct of the Commission and DG Trade very closely in the coming weeks .
Then there is the European Parliament , which is also complicated .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by extending , on behalf of our group , a warm welcome to our friends from Bulgaria and Romania and to assure them that we look forward to what will be a process of mutual learning .
Nothing can justify any kind of terrorism , and that is why it is our common task to fight against it .
The Community should in future draft a code of conduct for an international nuclear incident warning system under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
These dau@@ ghter directives which we are now to adopt must lay down procedures and parameters whereby this high quality standard may prevail throughout the Community .
What are we as Parliament doing ?
They are being put to the vote again in the plenary .
The Commission proposal on new rules for the allocation of slo@@ ts is a necessary intermediate step .
Dialogue between parliamentarians on both sides is an important pillar in the relationship between the EU and the United States .
Mr President , I would like to put one additional question : I share your opinion and thank you for this clear response that the complete adoption of the acquis communautaire is , of course , necessary for accession .
The European Union must attach foremost political priority to the struggle against unemployment , poverty and social exclusion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe needs a new energy and transport policy .
I do not actually know at the moment which Member States we are talking about .
We also need to make this clear .
We are still waiting for a response to this offer .
The Covenant of Ma@@ y@@ ors has a key role to play in this respect , but it is also important to support other , similar approaches , like the idea of a Covenant of Is@@ lands .
Some say that this is a directive which , in the first instance , needs to be seen as part of the financial services sector .
Secondly , what will you , the Commission and the Council , do to implement the recommendations in the report ?
Do you think it would be possible for them , too , to initiate a debate on the European Constitutional Treaty , because the Treaty could , of course , also support the future stability of those countries ?
That is the sticking point in today &amp; apos ; s votes .
We should see this directive for what it is , an internal market directive and a directive dealing with economic factors and unemployment .
Mr President , it is an interesting state of affairs in the European Parliament when all the leaders are still here .
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TA@@ Os .
I think - and this is an important point - that , in the sphere of business competition , we should also , in the European Union , be aware of the fact that there is such a thing as corporate know @-@ how how , and protecting this corporate know @-@ how how , should be a matter of major concern to all of us in the political sphere .
Parliament voted on it again two weeks ago in Strasbourg and I hope that here , too , Parliament will back the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s third paragraph , which deals with this .
As you are aware , the Nice European Council laid down the social policy agenda .
- Mr President , Commissioner , our group is genuinely committed to developing the strategic partnership between the EU and China , but these relations must be based upon complete openness , credibility and responsibility .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , Commissioner , I address the House on these three reports as the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets for the 1998 budget .
This is what I think makes it really necessary that the Commission should , by its approach , more firmly constra@@ in the Member States to pursue a coherent policy towards Africa , which will enable us to abandon these contradictions and secure that continent a better future than it would have otherwise .
His ability to achieve very broad consensus in this House on this extremely important issue is demonstrated not only by this debate , but also by the relatively few amendments that have been tabled .
But we know that the 15 governments of the Member States are unanimous in the view that we must stick to the Helsinki strategy .
Mr President , it has taken rather longer than expected , but we must discuss these important issues before turning to the less important ones .
The way in which the quotas have been determined creates the risk that in fact overfishing will result .
Nonetheless , these are important criteria for the European Union .
In the event of liberalisation of the private sector this would be just 3 % .
The Belder report also states this unequivocally .
Under Article 133 of the EC Treaty , which regulates the common commercial policy , the European Community is explicitly given exclusive power to legislate and to negotiate agreements on trade in energy products and to negotiate agreements on trade in energy services .
That is why the sanctions imposed by the international community must be maintained .
V@@ ague formu@@ lations and legal principles have given way to a clear system of fundamental rights which is binding on all the EU institutions and whenever European law is applied by the Member States .
Antibio@@ tic resistance is a subject which we must take seriously and which , hitherto , has had too little attention paid to it in the context of animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
Some people are still saying that dialogue is needed .
Europe needs all that , and only then will it regain acceptance and trust .
in writing . - I am voting in favour of the new air safety regulation , which creates greater safety in air traffic .
President Arias , on behalf of the European Parliament , I would like to thank you most sincerely for this brilliant , distinguished speech .
My second point is that I believe it is most important - and I have some information to the effect that the Ara@@ bs and Palestinians take the same view - for the European Union also to carry out some form of monitoring of the implementation of the W@@ ye Plan@@ tation agreement .
I am not very euph@@ or@@ ic about the results of the reform conference that is meeting now and will be concluded in Amsterdam , but this policy area , which concerns matters that are quite central to our social future , the question of energy supplies , of the Euratom Treaty , must be integrated in the European Treaties and must be subject to democratic control , to co @-@ decision decision with Parliament .
in writing . - I abstained from voting .
The Member States must at last become aware of their need to set an example , specifically as regards the transposition and ratification of EU acts .
Cooperation with other Member States , as well as closer checks at home , is absolutely vital , and not just in view of the imminent enlargement .
What is demanded of us is to talk less about transparency and democracy , and do more about them !
- Mr President , I voted in favour of the Roure report on the grounds that it constitutes a very positive initiative in favour of greater security .
- Mr President , well may we complain about this time .
However , I would have nothing against our continuing the vote through to the end now .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to associate myself with the previous speakers &amp; apos ; comments and to congratulate the Commission and the Council first of all on their swift action and then to offer my congratulations to Mrs Gi@@ ll on her excellent work .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , sometimes Members of this House are heard to say that Europe needs to develop a soul .
As you know , the Community can , in these Objective 1 areas , do such things as grant investment programmes higher cofinancing rates .
In future , the Commission must consider in advance what the effects of its measures on the social security systems in the Member States will be .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , European solidarity is within our grasp !
As an Austrian , I very much look forward to seeing Jo@@ e Wei@@ den@@ hol@@ zer here and I hope that we shall be able to welcome him here as a Member of Parliament as soon as possible .
Moreover , the composition of the Commission should reflect the spectrum of political tendencies that make up the European constitutional consensus .
I very much hope that this will meet with a response .
It has emerged from various studies that women are seriously under @-@ represented represented in wage negotiations , the consequence of which is that women &amp; apos ; s issues are taken too little into account in the labour market .
We also find that where collecting societies have control mechanisms they are not always compatible across borders and some of them are not very efficient .
In individual cases , the Ombudsman can spare the institution unjustified criticism , being , as a sort of outsi@@ der , able to lay claim to absolute objectivity .
( Applause ) The Socialist Group wants the European Union to honour the commitment it has entered into with regard to Eastern Europe .
The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that better coordination and more complement@@ arity between Community measures and national projects , with the help of the Group of Experts on Education , and more intensive cooperation with UNESCO and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa are of paramount importance in improving the effectiveness of Community aid .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner Verheugen , the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an adver@@ tis@@ ement for coherent work on the part of the Commission .
Commissioner , because we have heard some criticism of the Commission , I would like to congratulate you and your officials , who are with us today , for the committed approach which they take to this issue , and for always communicating and discussing matters with Parliament .
That is a sound basis for further progress , and I would like to encourage you to proceed resolutely along that path towards the promotion of sustainable development .
We shall accept the report for all these reasons .
- Before the vote on Amendment 3 :
It is dangerous , it is wrong and something must be done .
As a group , we favour the amendment brought forward by another group requiring that the money spent on lobbying should also be listed in the transparency register ; we intend supporting this amendment .
In the future , too , when additives , enz@@ y@@ mes and fla@@ v@@ our@@ ings are used in food , there will be a high level of consumer health protection - which is the way it should be .
Mr President , as I indicated before the vote , there is an oral compromise amendment that I discussed with Mrs Weber and Mr Dem@@ et@@ ri@@ ou - a compromise between amendments 37 and 39 . The compromise amendment would read as follows :
That is why I am asking for swif@@ ter action before the whole thing pac@@ ks up !
He has presented a good report .
For all these reasons we have voted for the Fiori Report .
I will now , to some degree , take into account to what extent Members are listed as speakers in later debates .
That is why I should like to focus on the future .
I believe , though , that Parliament , being com@@ posed of elected representatives , is the primary partner in dialogue .
The political problem highlighted by this whole issue is the pre@@ valence of profound mistrust .
There was one of the fields to which the PROGRESS programme applies for which we , together with the Committee on Women &amp; quot ; s Rights and Gender Equality , had to fight particularly hard , and that was gender mainstreaming .
The Council , and the Commission , too , would be well advised to try to seek a majority in Parliament , on the basis of this new treaty , that will also be able to meet the social , environmental and finance policy challenges that they themselves formulate in their programmes because , for legislation , they ultimately need a qualified majority in this Parliament if they want to push through their initiatives .
The European Union must remain attractive as a model .
The decisions the Commission has taken today are a response to the requests made by Parliament and the Council .
If that does not succeed , international support for Afghanistan is also at risk if women &amp; apos ; s rights are not respected .
If they are unable to prevent it , we must draw the appropriate conclusions .
Secondly , I would like to point out that , as far as we are able to predict , the fossil energy sources , that is coal , oil and gas , will predomin@@ ate for a long time to come in Europe alone , to say nothing of the rest of the world .
This is not just about economic cooperation , but also about sending out a clear signal that protectionism is not acceptable .
The directive includes a number of safety measures , with the focus being on mercury and maximum limits .
The current system could be improved if instruments currently available were used effectively and improved .
That is why we must all work together in order to take a step forward .
Sadly , the House - un@@ wisely , I have to say - did not take up our proposals .
Although I understand the EU strategy of striking a balance between a neighbourhood policy for continental Europe and a Mediterranean strategy , it seems to me that we should be setting priorities for a future European neighbourhood policy , as otherwise our ability to implement and finance it could be undermined .
The Council and Parliament should be prepared to do that .
I should like to express my very sincere thanks to the three rapporteurs and to say a few words on two or three specific points .
I should like to continue with this theme and say that I should like , in particular , to see a Commission President with so much commitment to standing up for Europe &amp; quot ; s future .
In my view , one conceivable option would be for the European Union to be involved in some way - to be decided by negotiations - in the European patent agreement and , in return , for the European Union to clear up the institutional concerns regarding the European Patent L@@ iti@@ gation Agreement ( EP@@ L@@ A ) .
We are prepared , and I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues here , to take over responsibility for Europe in the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe .
Mr President , I am sure the Spanish project is a highly emo@@ tive issue in Spain and I can understand that .
The creation of such a forum can only be the first step .
The principle of an open market economy with free competition embodied in the EU Treaty is a permanent remit and needs to be worked towards every day both in this House and in the Member States .
The EU Treaty leaves no room for economic nationalism .
In the medium and long term , we need a harmonised European airspace , higher standards of quality and safety , highly trained staff , high social standards and no low wages .
However , what we currently have on the table still does not represent the state of the art .
I think another aspect must be highlighted too : massive subsidies are needed for SMEs .
I have to say , with the benefit of hin@@ d@@ sight , that this was an excellent idea of Parliament &amp; apos ; s , as a great deal can now be done with this programme .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur .
It is when you look at cooperation between Asia and Europe from the point of view of democracy or human rights that you see how important it is for us to cooperate more closely with parliaments in the Asian countries and bring about positive developments .
There is still no progress on the Cyprus issue .
Mr President , unfortunately I was not in the chamber when the content of the human rights report was being discussed .
I agree with much of what has been said today : firstly legislative measures and secondly implementation measures .
The serious human rights abuses and acts of violence committed by the defe@@ ated President G@@ b@@ ag@@ b@@ o must be condemned by the EU in the strongest possible terms .
I do not know in detail .
We also have to ensure that this EU of ours plans for the long term , with regard to staff expenses as much as to anything else .
Whether it will actually come to that , I do not know .
I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 151 , which I have tabled jointly with several of my colleagues .
Those who want this project to succeed while leaving the resources unchanged must not be left without an answer when they want to real@@ locate them for the benefit of the Lisbon goals .
Finally , I would like to mention - since our Con@@ servative friend has already told us this - that the euro is probably also a successful example of employment policy .
There are problems here that are beyond our control .
The Commission texts on developing railway undertakings , on licensing railway undertakings and on allocating railway infrastructure capacity are a step in the right direction in this respect .
The crucial factor here is what happens at the next elections .
I have a very straightforward question to put to you : are you - the Commission - ready and will we manage this year , in 2001 , to present a common Commission and Parliament proposal for Laeken on the subsequent structure of the post @-@ Nice Nice process ?
The funding of the new system from EU or national resources must , in my view , be legally guaranteed .
It is also possible to help employees who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first let me thank Mrs Thomsen for her balanced report .
Both sides must now give very careful consideration to the consequences of their actions .
I supported the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s recommendation to amend the provisions of the Trade , Development and Cooperation Agreement in the field of rights , freedoms and security .
That is what we mean when we talk about our social model .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in 1995 the Member States jointly signed a convention under which , in order to safeguard Community interests and finances , the Member States make fraud against Community finances a punishable offence .
We have achieved a compromise on the ethics issue .
When we tabled our proposal on industrial policy for the 21st century , we agreed that we must not fall back into times of state control , bureaucracy and interven@@ tion@@ ism , but that we need to enhance the conditions for industrial activity in Europe to such an extent that Europe remains , or becomes , an attractive location for industry . This implies a definite renunciation of protectionism and state intervention , but also a firm offer of help in promoting and developing more competitiveness .
I therefore believe that any impetus given by the European Union and by the European Parliament will assist debate in the Member States , where we still have more questions than answers .
Within fifty years the EU has managed to create a peaceful , democratic and prosperous continent .
In future , international eng@@ agements should , in fact , be assessed for how sensible they are and their benefit to the EU .
It is in@@ es@@ capable that we must coordinate our economic policy , our tax policy , how we draw up our public budgets , how we ensure competitiveness , with each other much more and that we must assume joint responsibility .
Mr President , believing the Pieper report to be a good one , I did actually want to vote in favour of it , but , since both my amendments were rejected , I have ended up voting against .
in writing . - Europe and the world are currently facing considerable challenges .
The political world is called upon to do everything in its power to ensure that the safety of foodstuffs can be guaranteed .
We also wish you and your presidency success in handling the financial perspective .
If we were now to give our approval to the additional protocol , then it would no longer be open to us - the statement by the chairman of the Socialist Group this morning notwithstanding - to exert influence on the Turkish Government .
The precise details are set out in the report .
But that is not true .
Not only are the EU &amp; apos ; s existing directives on the equality of men and women in need of improvement , they also need to be better transposed in the Member States .
This deployment will , in my opinion , prove to be much more effective and we in Parliament should also make sure in future that the European side can influence the deployment of funds .
The European Parliament has also made its own contribution .
Madam President , thank you , in particular , for being so fair as to announce the list of speakers in advance .
Croatia has made significant progress , especially by ratifying the European Convention on Human Rights , the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture , the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Min@@ orities and the European Charter for Regional or Min@@ ority Lan@@ gu@@ ages .
New approaches are needed by increasingly involving the Member States ; subsidiarity also relie@@ ves the burden on Brussels in implementing European tasks and increases everyone &amp; apos ; s sense of responsibility - a sense of responsibility that has hitherto not existed .
However , I firmly believe that many things discussed within Austria in recent months - you know what I have in mind - should now be put to one side . The message of the Austrian presidency should now be &amp; apos ; Yes , we must make progress in building a common European security system &amp; apos ; .
It is on the basis of the information they brought back with them that a decision will be taken on whether , and if so how , to support the electoral process , and , above all , on whether sending an EU mission to observe the elections on 27 July makes sense , is advisable or , indeed , feasible .
It is not only business people and tourists but young people , above all , who have an important role to play .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me join in the gratitude expressed for the five years we have been able to spend working with the Commissioner .
My final point relates to the common European list . If we are to take European political union seriously , we should be happy to see our citizens organi@@ zing themselves on a Europe @-@ wide wide basis and standing as candidates in democratic elections .
Everyone should be able to choose their own energy supplier , and everyone should be able to get their electricity from the gener@@ ator of their choice ; if they could do that , it would give us a real chance of resha@@ ping the European market .
I should like to remind you that here in Parliament it has been repeatedly urged that the Commission should only make such proposals when reports on these two sectors are being discussed in the European Parliament , and when a view has been expressed on them .
The purpose of the strategy is to equip Turkey for entering into negotiations .
Among these substantive points are the principle of labelling genetically modified seed - a labelling provision which goes well beyond the requirements of the Regulation concerning novel foods and which , I hope , will set an example - and the fact that we are undertaking a revision here and that a similar labelling regime will soon be established for consumer goods .
If we want to be successful in Copenhagen , we must also discuss an environmentally compatible transport policy .
Now to the 16 proposed amendments .
It is because we , the European Union , are not making a good enough , credible enough or convincing enough job of doing what they expect of us .
I am convinced that a core indicator of integration - and , moreover , for everyone - is adherence to the basic rules of democracy , protection of minorities and respect for human rights .
So I just wanted to ask : have I misunderstood something or has the timetable changed in some way ?
Parliament and the Council are excluded from this decision : it is a matter for the Commission alone .
That is the decisive goal that we must achieve .
At European level , we already have excellent instruments for protecting biological diversity ; I am thinking here of the Natura 2000 networking programme or the Hab@@ itats Directive .
We need to be quite clear about this : if we want to avoid conflicts in the European Union in the long term , we must manage the influx of economic migrants , taking particular account of the as@@ simi@@ lation and integration capacities of our Member States .
It is truly a very difficult birth - not just the report to this Parliament , but also the Institute as such .
Mr President , that was the last report by my colleague , Mr Al@@ ber .
In this area in particular there is an urgent need for a reform of EU policies to ensure that eastward enlargement is affordable and feasible in the long term .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I count myself among those who wish to extend the warmest of congratulations to the Council Presidency on its success .
Mr President , the Commissioner must listen to me for a moment , otherwise there is no point in my speaking !
In an overall judgement , we have to decide whether or not , tomorrow , we can affirm our confidence in this Commission . In so doing , Parliament accepts responsibility for the Commission , as well as for individual proposals , and that does not make our decision any the easier .
I believe that the way in which Mr Cox represented the European Parliament in Central and Eastern Europe made a major contribution towards creating and building up trust in the European institutions .
We call on the Commission to present proposals for dau@@ ghter directives and to do so within 18 months of the entry into force of the framework directive .
