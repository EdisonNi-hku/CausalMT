I want to say to the Commissioner that considerable attention has to be given to ensuring that the rules for this new company statute are consistently implemented across the Member States .
I raise this because , in November , Parliament approved a new directive , and that directive is now with the Council .
To have an effective influence on the world stage , we must end our paralysis in Common Foreign and Security Policy decision @-@ making making .
Yes , Israel has a right to defend itself against indiscriminate attacks on civilians , but it has a duty as a democracy to be more just than its dis@@ pos@@ able power implies .
These products are marketed throughout the European Union , and that is why it is necessary to have a high level of protection in the whole of the EU .
For more than 100 years , The Hague Conference on Private International Law has worked ti@@ rel@@ essly and with an ever @-@ growing growing number of countries across the globe to put together numerous international conventions on civil law subjects : sale of goods , t@@ esta@@ ment@@ ary dis@@ positions , child abduction , maintenance obligations and road @-@ traffic traffic accidents .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on this very important report .
Therefore , I would underline , as does the report , that the delivery of health care falls within the responsibility of Member States .
I know that honourable Members will understand when I say that this subject is one of particular interest to me .
It also benefited from the cooperation of an observer delegation from Parliament , led by Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra Neyra , who is here today as well .
Let me start here on a positive note .
The Commission will thereby take suggestions made by the European Parliament , in particular at the first reading of the Directive , into consideration .
Madam President , I have the honour to bring this report to the House on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
As regards the part of the financial market which is already supranational and operates cross@@ border and often cross@@ sector , one of our main messages is to create real convergence in the implementation of the European directives and real convergence of supervisory practice , thereby avoiding regulatory arbitr@@ age and possible competition on other factors for establishment such as fiscal and cost aspects .
I would like to add that I am very happy with the choice of Me@@ gl@@ ena Kuneva as Bulgarian Commissioner , and with her portfolio , which covers a very important policy area .
. Madam President , given the state of our seas , the Commissioner &amp; quot ; s first priority should be to save the fish .
However , it is possible to envisage situations where safety up@@ grad@@ es are economically meaningful and technically feasible , so this is what we can commit to at this stage .
I believe that the agreement reached on this regulation reflects clearly the desire of the Council to send a signal of encouragement to the members of the Turkish Cypriot community that its future lies within a united Cyprus and within the European Union .
It is encouraging that the Macedon@@ ian Government has established an action plan to meet benchmarks and a new national plan for the adoption of the acquis .
These should be left to the discretion of Member States .
The British Conservative Delegation is particularly keen to protect children and their rights , and the standards which are applied in the UK are generally very high .
Only this week the need for continued for vigilance in this area was again highlighted with the publication of the ICES report on the prospects for catches in 2002 .
We also appreciate that by deciding to close the Chernobyl plant before the end of 2000 , Ukraine lived up to the commitment it made under the international agreement signed with the governments of the of the G7 countries and with the European Commission .
The Commission welcomes the new initiatives being taken against HIV / Aids by some countries to produce cheaper gener@@ ic drugs and would like to offer its support to help such countries provide technical assistance to other developing countries to enable them to pursue such initiatives .
Finally , as Co @-@ President President of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly , I think that we have a very serious role to play in the EU &amp; apos ; s negotiations .
Firstly , concerning the scope of the review : I am very sympathetic towards a more open review of the acquis , but we have already stipul@@ ated that the Commission agrees that it should , in principle , be limited to the eight directives covered by the Green Paper .
Moreover , I should like to stress that this proposal will also enable tax administrations to carry out tax audits more efficiently .
This is obvious , so it is also obvious that Parliament , the Commission and everybody involved has shown a great deal of goodwill .
author . - Mr President , I rise on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to introduce this oral question which has been prompted by recent accidents in Italy and the Netherlands , both of which , sadly , had fa@@ talities .
However , we have to do more .
So , as chairman of a committee , I insist that you as President of this sitting report back fully to the Bureau and express our strong dis@@ pleasure at the appalling organisation of this sitting .
Despite the Seville Conclusions , is the Commissioner still committed to the far more comprehensive approach to asylum legislation , and indeed illegal immigration , in the Tampere Conclusions , which looked at the causes of migration to the European Union ?
I can assure you that the Commission will certainly do that , because just before Christmas we had such a Council meeting .
They take us one step closer to a more balanced immigration policy and one based on solidarity .
That report was based on two premises : first , that the professions are entrusted with the delivery of services of considerable public importance ; but second , that any restriction on the supply of professional services will tend to drive up costs and prices and will limit consumer access and choice .
I should like to make three points .
The need to achieve an early agreement on the package must be balanced with the importance of ensuring that a fair and a reasonable set of proposals is seen to be adopted .
Mr President , following the Amsterdam negotiations and the introduction of the new chapter on employment , and following the decision to hold a special summit on employment , Mr Je@@ an@@ Claude Juncker threw down a challenge to all Member States and to our institutions that such a summit would only be worthwhile if it led to concrete and viable steps forward .
Instead , I took part in the meeting of the Commission - our weekly meeting - and in that meeting we adopted a Commission communication entitled , &amp; apos ; The Western Balkans : enhancing the European perspective &amp; apos ; .
Many European states do not implement the Hague Convention either in spirit or , indeed , in law .
On the one hand we have a government with no connections to the armed forces and with a card @-@ carrying carrying member of the Camp@@ aign for Nuclear Dis@@ armament as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , using the armed forces as a political tool to further its ambitions in Europe and apparently realising rather too late that the European Union defence scheme would indeed damage the NATO alliance and transatlantic relations .
On the issue of establishing a system for assessing the impact of the various Community policies on territorial cohesion within the Union , it is true that current impact assessment does not take into account territorial cohesion issues .
We believe that we need a screening exercise of the Commission by 30 April 2007 so that we can understand what the mid @-@ term term demands of the Commission are before taking radical action to cut back .
The Charter must bind the Commission , the Council , Parliament and the Committee of the Regions , but should it be a &amp; apos ; central reference point for the European Court of Justice and national courts &amp; apos ; ?
That is the message I intend to take to my electorate .
Mr President , I strongly support the proposal made by our colleague Mr Stubb .
There needs to be a programme to ensure observance of minimum standards of due process , fair trials in criminal proceedings and approximation of rights of defendants .
The Commission is also itself investigating alleged anti @-@ competitive competitive behaviour by certain operators , and has launched five anti @-@ trust trust proceedings in the course of this year .
Will you use your powers in office to enforce such directives , which play such an important part in the integration process ?
They are of various na@@ tures , but the current four preparatory actions initiated by this Parliament give a good outlook on what we are talking about : cooperation with middle @-@ income income countries in Asia and Latin America , which is not covered by the DCI , and business and scientific exchanges with China and India .
I , too , would urge the Council to reconsider its attitude to this office .
Though I hesitate to say this , it is nonsense to suggest that secretari@@ es @-@ general general should sit in this Interinstitutional Committee .
The Commission supports the texts which you are about to vote on , and we can welcome and agree on all of your amendments .
I do not want to oppose the Commission proposal , referred to in the Langenhagen report , to allow industrial fishing to continue in this particular case .
Nonetheless , we accept the verdict of the House .
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 3 .
Science is about judgements , about weigh@@ ing the evidence and drawing the appropriate conclusions .
First of all , climate change : without renewable energy sources it is rather naive to expect that we could mas@@ ter the climate change challenge .
While there might be some categories of expenditure for which stability could be expected at regional level between the programming periods , it could hardly be suggested that the level of spending on , for example , major infrastructure should be maintained at the same level in each region regardless of current needs .
I call on the Commission to be particularly vigilant during the negotiations on the products more sensitive to this aggressive competition , in particular beef and bu@@ tter .
To get there we do not need more han@@ dou@@ ts , which just keep people in subsist@@ ence poverty ; we need to work to create economic growth . Economic growth can only come from enterprise and education , but education and enterprise can only come if there are the instruments to create economic growth .
So there are alternatives , but Turkey is our priority route and I think it is beneficial for Turkey as well .
First of all , we do not have very good experience with indicative targets ; but secondly , in the energy efficiency area as it relates to all areas , mandatory targets are providing a sustainable policy .
I fully agree with the suggestion that higher education should be more effectively linked with the labour market . Cooperation between Member States is key to dealing with the problems of youth unemployment , which can have both heavy social and economic costs .
This is not in keeping with the values or the honour of our common European Parliament , to which we have all been elected .
We have an obligation to encourage and support the moder@@ ates .
Furthermore , mixed mar@@ ri@@ ages - quite naturally - give new perspectives and may facilitate intercultural or inter@@ religious dialogue .
When we had our debate in the hearing with the Commissioner about a month or so ago , my committee , the Committee on the Environment , was really rather in two minds as to whether it wanted to see emissions trading measures put forward , but it is worth our while to explore that line .
The Commission is firmly convinced - and the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid has said this on several occasions - that frank and open dialogue between the EU and Cuba provides the best framework for discussion on matters of common concern to the two sides , including questions of human rights .
I have noted some concerns here .
Let us keep it alive and make it work for the joint benefit of the EU and Turkey .
Nevertheless , I believe that this has not always been implemented satisfactorily , either for the Parliament or for the Commission , particularly as regards communicating effectively to the wider public what the Union does .
As drafted the amendment is not acceptable as it would have quite different effects from those intended .
We are taking other practical steps which are calibr@@ ated to the new political climate .
The Commission does not have the answer to that question .
The main environmental damage is caused by overfishing of depleted stocks of commercially valuable fish , not to mention damage to non @-@ targeted targeted species including fish and damage to the marine habitat such as cor@@ al be@@ ds .
We must oppose any form of European support for the war or participation in it .
I think it is a first cautious step towards dealing with harmonisation on issues that cause great emo@@ tion and a lot of political ag@@ itation .
Liberals and Democrats in this House will lead the way in campaigning for the constitution and we expect every one of Europe &amp; apos ; s governments to be in the van@@ guard .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , as has been said many times , we have been negotiating this for a very long time and - as Mr Mor@@ a@@ es pointed out - we have had the objective of having a joint common asylum policy since 1999 .
If we want an open Europe in terms of global trade , we need investment .
What about self @-@ employed employed workers who are in a position similar to employees but who do not have an employment contract ?
We need to be sure , during the transition period for inspection , that the reasons why these have been used , and used effectively , are fully understood by the Commission and that they are not simply arbitrarily removed from the scene .
I keep returning to this in my discussions .
It is essential for the sake of consumers and , indeed , producers and suppliers that we have a sensible regime for the protection of public health .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , like all of us , I would like to pay hom@@ age to Aung San Suu Kyi , whose freedom has just been restored .
The right of scrutiny for the Parliament is foreseen for areas relating to codecision , that is Article 8 .
I welcome this report , but would stress that we will not get anywhere unless we are prepared to stem the flow of arms into regions of conflict .
That is why we are all seeking a &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; vote for the referendum in Ireland .
We cannot allow that to happen as a Parliament and we must call for your support right across the political groups for this amendment .
I would like to underline what the President said about achieving results through the Lisbon Agenda .
The European Parliament has been working constructively and is united on this subject .
I urge the EU to honour its commitments in terms of market access and debt alleviation and to reaffirm the importance of reaching the ODA target of 0.@@ 15 % to 0.@@ 20 % of G@@ N@@ I for the LDCs , mobilising , for this purpose , domestic resources and , as a complementary measure , innovative financing mechanisms .
I will be glad to consider that in the context of the various invitations a Commissioner receives .
Commissioner , would you agree that it is of paramount importance that we have a European solution to this problem and would you accept our congratulations that you have put your best efforts towards that in the events over the weekend .
Mr President , the tragic events of 11 September have certainly changed the face of the aviation industry and will probably have more effects in the months to come .
But we also believe in checks and balances and we want the Commission &amp; apos ; s actions to be fully revie@@ w@@ able by the Court of Justice .
But there are other legislative vehicles for tackling these particular sectors and they must be looked at on that basis .
At the end of a long process , may I thank once again our excellent rapporteur who has worked in a remarkable way , our shadows and everyone else involved .
At this moment , I do not insist on a particular outcome , although I reserve the right to continue questioning the technical and political dimensions .
The associated legal and financial obligations , such as , observ@@ ing standards on wages and working conditions , and , the payment of taxes and social security contributions are also thereby extern@@ alised to sub@@ contractors and employment agencies .
Furthermore , as a result of the brutal austerity , in many countries , it is virtually impossible for young people to get a decent job after finishing education .
We are equally committed to seeing progress in the field of post @-@ conflict conflict situations and , therefore , we support the proposal for a peace @-@ building building commission as an instrument that will fill an existing gap between post @-@ conflict conflict situations and long @-@ term term sustainable peace .
However , they face challenges such as global warming , which is a huge challenge for them .
I would merely reiterate what I said in my initial answer .
The first is the fight against the financing of terrorism , which is much more complex .
Many people have made the point here in recent weeks that we need to work to try to understand the root causes of terrorism .
Concerning economic issues and economic cooperation , I would underline that the Commission strongly supports the aim of closer economic cooperation between the European Union and the United States .
I therefore ask the Commission to look at the cru@@ x of this debate : how do we get good patent law which re@@ wards our most innovative companies for their investment in R &amp; amp ; D while , at the same time , not allowing companies to use patents to abuse a dominant position , lock up technology and stifle innovation and competition ?
Last but not least , development education and raising the awareness of our own citizens on this subject should be considered a priority .
I will have to make further remarks on the resolution .
I thank the rapporteur once again for accepting the amendments tabled by Mr Harbour and myself and which we have worked on for a long period of time .
This is the main issue of disagreement with the Commission report , and with some of us .
If the Commission does not get active quickly enough , the whole project will end up in smoke .
There was the greatest concern about the political and security developments both in Gaza and in Israel , but also recognition that there is no alternative to continuing this humanitarian support and , on the other hand , to exploring how to support this Arab peace initiative .
What now do the ph@@ ras@@ es &amp; apos ; the fight against social exclusion &amp; apos ; or &amp; apos ; the guarantee of adequate social protection &amp; apos ; contained in Article 9 signi@@ fy to those citizens ?
As you rightly state in your report , tropical deforestation is a matter of concern for us all and I consider that a distinction should be made here between two aspects : deforestation and climate change on the one hand and combating illegal exploitation of forests on the other .
The Commission can accept in full Amendments 1 , 4 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 13 and 31 , which provide useful clarifications to the text .
Let us take diversification .
So I would like to warmly thank him for that and , of course , we look forward to it .
I look to their support and cooperation in this regard .
I can assure you that the Commission is relentless in proposing measures to stabilise the situation in the financial market and in seeking long @-@ term term solutions .
Now it has returned to us it is particularly pleasing that the Council has adopted the thrust of most of our amendments .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Paulsen , my colleague on many food safety deliberations , for the work she has done on these complex regulations .
I too would be happy if the Commissioner would answer all the questions together , if that were possible .
The achievement of these targets will not be easy and fiscal measures are one of the concrete tools which can be utilised to assist in the task .
There is so much criticism of migrants who fail to integrate , but little is done to assist them through , for example , family reunification or rights of free movement .
Let us proceed with democracy in each Member State with a ratification process , but also respect the decision of each Member State , while also remembering persistence .
The topic is not unknown to me .
Finally , will he consider the possibility of a public inquiry into the way this matter has been handled ?
The Commission is well aware that for many yards and regions this has been a difficult process .
In the communication adopted on 9 March 2010 , the Commission concluded that Greece is implementing the Council Decision of 16 February 2010 and that , based on available information , the fiscal measures announced by the Greek authorities on 3 March appear sufficient to safeguard the 2010 budgetary targets .
It is a very serious issue for EU Member States , in particular EU cities .
Mr President , the Commission welcomes this timely debate and shares the deep concerns that have been raised by Belarus &amp; apos ; appalling record on human rights and democracy .
I believe that future cases will demonstrate the need for clarity and will demonstrate the need for the sort of guidelines that we have originally drafted .
The second thematic issue is children &amp; quot ; s rights .
It specifically refers to interinstitutional agreements ; it even categ@@ oris@@ es them .
Member of the Commission . Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Wojciechowski , and members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the work that has been carried out on this report .
With EU support , Ireland tabled the resolution on the Elimin@@ ation of All Form@@ s of Re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous In@@ tolerance at the UN Commission on Human Rights and the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly , which urges states to guarantee freedom of thought , conscience , religion and belief , facilitate worship and combat intolerance .
These include the demand that in a new post @-@ 2006 2006 financial framework more money should be allocated to TENs .
However , I abstained in the final vote because amendment 2 was rejected .
Europe is not short of expertise .
It is very important to note that this energy question shows that today we have an interdependent relationship with Russia .
However , the situation may deterior@@ ate further because access to the Gaza Strip is still a problem .
But I am quite confident that tomorrow we will have come to the end of this particular long road and I think it will be to the great credit of all involved .
This is an issue of respect for international humanitarian law .
However , as Commissioner Wallström said , citizens must have confidence in the Ombudsman &amp; apos ; s capacity to do that .
Let me say in relation to time limits and the eight @-@ hour hour rule that the reason why Europe had a real problem in getting this regulation into place was because many Member States , including Ireland , know that we need to transport our animals for longer dur@@ ations , but we also know how to look after them in so doing .
We are saying the same thing .
I welcome the strong commitment given by A@@ K@@ P de@@ puty leader Mr Ab@@ dul@@ lah Gu@@ l during his recent visit to Brussels to continue with the reform programme .
Member of the Commission . - The previous discussion extensively covered the open @-@ ended ended contract , which I think is one of the practical solutions .
Hence our opposition .
I want you to raise at the Council working group the Austrian model where , under the Mis@@ leading Ad@@ ver@@ tising Directive , they already ban these practices .
We are in our opening gamb@@ its , but in our group , we will be looking very clearly at the quality of expenditure - as the Commissioner has said , on expenditure where monies can be reasonably executed and not being in any way excessive in this regard because of the general situation we find ourselves in .
Our role should be to stop creating the instability that fuels these vast population movements : there must be no more wars such as those against Iraq and Afghanistan ; we must pull out of Libya before we are drawn into a ground war ; we must canc@@ el the planned conflict with Iran and we must avoid encouraging dis@@ content in other Middle Eastern states .
You mentioned in your speech that you do not see the issue as a clash of civilisations .
I am confident this House shares that choice - a choice of determination , a choice for Europe - and I count on your input as we continue our work .
Parliament has played a very important role in pointing towards the outcome on existing plants , and I am grateful to Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten Ruijten for her efforts as rapporteur .
We hope that the result will be positive as soon as possible .
Mr President , it is an honour to present this report on Iraq to Parliament this evening .
This is an important matter , and I would ask if after that debate clo@@ ses a deadline can be fixed for motions for resolutions to be lodged on that topic .
As I have already said , institution building is just as important , as are legal , judicial and police reform , because that is where human rights are applied .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with the points that have been made about the need to see Kazakhstan in a historical perspective and about the importance of Kazakhstan to us and in the region and also about the fact that we have to encourage Kazakhstan to move further , to say when things have gone wrong but to do it in the right way .
I guess what I wanted to emphasise is what we have tried to say throughout our negotiations : that what we have dealt with is what the internal market can deal with , and that is the trade .
The report is very wide @-@ ranging ranging , so I must focus on just a few issues .
That fact was also drawn to the attention of the parties who were involved in these discussions over the last couple of weeks .
We can only judge these elections when the electoral law is published and when we see if clear and fair arrangements are in place for the ballot .
deputising for the author . - Mr President , I very much welcome this debate and the progress that is going to be made following the ECJ judgments , and I know that the Commission has this in its sights .
An EU b@@ es@@ et by a democratic deficit cannot be fully effective in extending the zone of democracy to future Member States .
All in all , the situation in Macao has been positive .
We know that the agenda that we have set out is very ambitious , but I think we can deliver if we just stay the course .
At this point I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Liikanen for the innovative measures that he has brought forward and the way that he is striving to bring Europe into the 21st century .
It is vital that we reconnect with the citizens so that we really can live up to our claim to be the voice of the people in EU decision @-@ making making .
Firstly , the continuing attempt to create a European Public Prosecutor &amp; apos ; s office , is something which I am resolutely opposed to .
Also , as was briefly mentioned by the chair of our committee , the job shocks that our regions are now facing , such as the out@@ sour@@ cing and off@@ sh@@ oring of work - issues that this House is at last taking seriously - will have to be incorporated into the Lisbon goals .
I think that through the very wide consensus achieved with the collaboration of my shadow rapporteurs and everybody , we are conve@@ ying a very clear message to the Council and to the Commission , which has the task of negotiation , but also to our Lib@@ yan interlocutors , on what points we believe are absolutely essential to be met if we are to achieve the improvements that we want to see in the bilateral relations , and also on the crucial question of respect for human rights in Libya . That message is very clear .
That being said , there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved .
All these areas need to be addressed in a proper way so that we will get the best for the European Union .
Re@@ patri@@ ation of refugees is not satisfactory as the people are simply afraid to return to vill@@ ages devastated , over@@ run and terroris@@ ed by the terrorists or the war@@ lor@@ ds .
In response to Mr V@@ las@@ á@@ k &amp; apos ; s comments about the Ombudsman , I take these comments very much to heart .
Clearly there are two schools of thought on this issue .
In view of the fact that that women occupy only one seat in four in national parliaments and governments , that only 10 % of the directors of major listed companies in the EU are women and that only 3 % of such companies are chaired by women , the Commission states , in its strategy for equality between women and men 2010 @-@ 2015 2015 , that it will consider &amp; apos ; initiatives &amp; apos ; , &amp; apos ; monitor progress &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; support efforts &amp; apos ; to promote women &amp; apos ; s participation .
The economic benefits of such a system of euro@@ bonds are huge and clear .
We are proud of the role that we have played in significantly sof@@ tening the original approach to make the report acceptable .
Will the sustainability criteria as proposed by the Commission solve this problem and make it illegal to sell biofuels on the European market that have been involved in this practice ?
We do not deny the importance of these agreements , but we believe that if we are ex@@ pending European taxpayers &amp; quot ; money , whether for targeted assistance or in relation to fishing rights , we should know exactly how this money is being expen@@ ded .
Ob@@ sta@@ c@@ les may be placed in the path of democracy but ultimately justice will prevail .
Mr President , I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation to colleague Hatzidakis for a very fine report to Parliament here this afternoon .
In fact , the object of the directive we are discussing here today is to reduce the adverse effects of incineration on the environment and on human health by considerably reducing the emission levels of several major pollutants into the air .
I am very thankful for the underlining of the importance of EU 2020 , because this is exactly why we need to improve and change the framework in which companies operate , looking into how to create positive , conducive environments so that research and development companies and companies involved in innovation can flourish , and into how these could bring additional added value to European economies , and into how to create the conditions for their staying in Europe and not looking for opportunities to manufacture the products somewhere else .
Closer cooperation with that institution should also be envisaged in order to enhance the protection of pluralism in Europe .
Many of the general points raised in our committee &amp; apos ; s report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan &amp; apos ; s report .
Enlargement is a key driver for political and economic reform .
After all , it is in everybody &amp; apos ; s interest to see - and hopefully soon - a stable and democratic Iran whose citizens enjoy the same freedom and rights as we do here in the EU .
That will be complementary to the Energy Council , which we will re @-@ energise energise as well .
The replies we received from the competent authorities were not convincing .
I think it is a good piece of legislation and I for one , as I go into this election process , will be very happy to hold this up as an example of what the European Union can do well .
Mr President , thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this House for the first time as European Ombudsman and to present the Ombudsman &amp; apos ; s Annual Report for 2002 .
The Commission agrees with Mr Cashman that these problems will multi@@ ply as EU citizens increasingly use their rights to work and reside in other Member States .
It is right , as the Declaration says , that European institutions should become closer to the citizens , less intru@@ sive , less unwieldy and more efficient and open to democratic scrutiny .
in writing . - It is known that the protocol is aimed at ensuring that trade between both Parties develops smoothly within a high level of customs security and that it includes a set of rules to ensure that the Agreement and the EU acquis remain in alignment .
The Commission took speedy action to try to assist the Turkish people and its government in their efforts to deal with the catastrophe .
However , globalisation must be a win @-@ win win situation .
Finally , the externalisation and the approach that we are advocating in company with several honourable Members from all parts of this House - and I pay them tribute - is certainly not a departure from the concept or practice of a permanent , independent and competent European public service .
Similarly , in Germany there are problems with the ability of the German economy to move in a way which will help the country meet the 3 % deficit requirement .
However , there is more to trade than simple liberalisation : we have to give developing countries assistance in getting their goods to the market and we have to give them assistance in terms of meeting our technical and health standards .
While welcoming the sentiments on dealing with poverty expressed in the Commission &amp; apos ; s package , what we are really looking for is concrete action .
Many of the recommendations are valid for all Member States and not just the new countries .
Would he agree that the European Union , as well as the institutions within the European Union , should encourage and support this development and also that these further developments would strengthen the case for the Irish language to become a working language of the European Union and the institutions of the European Union ?
If the rules were obe@@ yed we would have no problem .
It requires an integrated approach , and in practice this means the Lisbon Strategy working hand @-@ in in @-@ hand hand with the sustainable development strategy - two strategies working in parallel and in coordination towards the overarching objective of sustainable development .
Unfortunately , there is not much chance of that , given that the Labour Government will not even give them a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty , which it promised in its election manif@@ esto .
Finally , the Commission regards it as important to the process that Parliament be kept informed of the Commission &amp; apos ; s developing thinking in relation to the potential proposal for a new capital adequacy regime .
I conclude by saying that until the refugee issue has found a just and comprehensive solution , the Union &amp; apos ; s support for UN@@ R@@ W@@ A , as a provider of para @-@ governmental governmental services in the West Bank , Gaza , Lebanon , Jordan and Syria , to alleviate the very difficult lives of 3.@@ 5 million Palestinian people in the refugee camps , is absolutely crucial .
in writing . - I voted for this Report which makes it clear at the beginning ( Paragraph 1 ) and the end ( Paragraph 61 ) that the main responsibility for pensions rests through the subsidiarity principle with the Member States , the EU contribution being to provide coordination where possible and the sharing of best practice .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank everybody for their interventions and to make two brief remarks .
As the rapporteur on the Regulation on Access to Docu@@ ments , I feel it only right to point out that in the judgment of 16 February 2000 , the European Court of Human Rights confirmed its earlier case law , that it is data relating to the private life of an individual that falls within the scope of Article 8 .
Perhaps some of us ought to consider more carefully the view that what Europe needs today is more unity and cohesion and less subsidiarity .
Our aim is to bring together a series of targeted short @-@ term term initiatives that will help counter adverse effects on the wider economy , while adapting the medium to long @-@ term term measures of the Lisbon Strategy to take account of the crisis .
Mr Barroso , some of the competences we have in the European Union - the internal market for energy policy , the trans @-@ European European networks , competition rules and trade policy - are the instruments that we must use with relation not only to Russia but also to other parts of the world .
That is what we should be doing and how we should be handling it .
I ask the Commission to take that on board .
We have made a preliminary analysis of energy efficiency action plans , which are part of the package and sometimes a bit overshadowed by the legislative efforts .
The national solution should not be to the detriment of the neighbours and the price for it should not be paid by future generations .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s recent communication is so important because it shows a willingness to use all the means that we have at our disposal whether they are Community or Member State instruments .
I do not believe that the time is yet right for a full Parliamentary Assembly at global level .
I hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to agree on the amendments to be adopted later in plenary , so that we can reach agreement on both food and feed and traceability in labelling in this part @-@ session session .
Therefore , I cannot accept Amendment 8 , the second paragraph of Amendment 9 , nor Amendments 10 , 11 and 24 .
With regard to the Purvis Report , I should like to say the following .
Mr President , this resolution has been tabled in the name of certain political groups , but the name of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group does not appear .
They will decide purely on market grounds and not on the basis of the uni@@ qu@@ eness of health care as a non @-@ market market universal service .
We welcome the increased assistance in the agricultural sector , particularly in the life of what we have been told that there is now some recognition that reform has to take place .
That has been and remains a very valuable contribution to our policy arm@@ our@@ y , although I think that we have to do rather more in making use of it .
That is why , as a group , we have submitted a number of amendments to Mr Ster@@ ck@@ x &amp; apos ; s report .
There can be no tolerance in the Commission of fraud , corruption or financial irregularities .
We are told that the euro is a great success because of its strength as a currency .
We welcome the endorsement of the Basel III reform and the fact that the G20 will continue to work on system@@ ically important financial institutions .
The Commission , in the review of the structural funds , must give consideration to the various regional imbalances .
Although it may have some spil@@ lo@@ ver effect in the not too far distant future to third countries , we are not having a world @-@ wide wide effect .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - I agree entirely with that .
I would like to praise the work the European Parliament and the Commission have done over the years in terms of the PEACE programme .
It is unlikely therefore that any further change would be accepted .
Mr Pimenta worries that this might be a delaying tactic and in many ways the work needs to be done beforehand by high level officials .
in writing . - Whilst we agree with those parts of the proposal that provide for the equal treatment of Parliament with the Council with regard to access to meetings and to information ; for regular dialogue between the President of the Commission and the President of the Parliament ; cooperation on citizens &amp; apos ; initiatives ; impact assessments on legislation ; and the use of &amp; apos ; soft law &amp; apos ; ( rather than punitive law ? ) ; we disagree with : a reaffirmation and strengthening of compulsory time limits for the implementation of directives ; and the use of congratu@@ lat@@ ory language about the European Union and its officers .
During the course of 1997 it is absolutely essential that the Council , the Commission and this Parliament seek to establish a mechanism as a counter@@ weight to the centralized monetary authority of the European Central Bank so that we have some sort of economic governance within the European Union .
President of the Commission . - You are basically right in your analysis regarding the situation in the labour market .
I would also like to remind you that , from the very beginning , there were difficulties in the Council in reaching an agreement .
I am happy now that we have come to this strong joint commitment .
We can disagree and we can argue constructively , but we do so within a framework of agreed rules and procedures .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , for several months Mauritania has been experiencing a tense political situation , opposing a large section of the Parliament to the President of Mauritania .
Finland at present being the only Union member having a common border with Russia sees the development of mutu@@ all@@ y@@ beneficial and peaceful relationships with that country as all @-@ important important , in marked contrast to NATO strategy .
Madam President , I think it is fair that it be put to the vote .
What have these negotiations achieved ?
The draft compromise before us today would strengthen this high level of protection through several provisions .
in writing . - Tackling climate change at this moment of deep financial turmoil and decre@@ ased confidence in economic systems may seem for many a mistake in terms of priorities .
in writing . - I strongly support the amendment of certain elements of Regulation ( EC ) No 1215 / 2009 in order to permit the extension of its validity to 31 December 2015 and make certain adjustments consequent to the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia .
Until we get that we are not going to see an improvement on the whole issue of accoun@@ tancy , or of the Structural Funds , or of where the responsibility lies .
That is basically the view everybody has expressed , and it is something that we will be trying to do in the coming days .
The Austrian Government is to be congratulated for making sure that the way ahead is clearly time@@ tabled to Cologne and to Helsinki , that the decisions needed are identified and that the broad outlines of many initiatives are set .
I feel that they do not fully reflect and precisely interpret the complex and difficult situation of small Member States like Malta .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would like to support the EPP &amp; apos ; s proposal for postponement on the vote .
When they give their say as to whether they are going to take up this complaint or not , that is when the Swedish Presidency will give its next reaction to this process .
We expect our Turkish counterparts to continue to make painful changes in their own society with difficult impact on their domestic politics .
. First of all I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn and the officials DG Enlargement for the serious and assidu@@ ous way in which they have been guiding and monitoring Bulgaria &amp; quot ; s progress towards accession .
The Commission strongly supported - and continues to support - that call .
The Irish presidency is right to focus on enlargement .
This is not the same as the Commission &amp; apos ; s position , but I respect the outcome of the legislative procedure .
This will give the European Parliament the chance to shape the budget , but also to shape our priorities and to identify savings ourselves , but in the meantime , we should continue to work to ensure that our budget for 2011 is acceptable to Members , to this Parliament and , of course , to the public as well .
Firstly , as the Council is now making a contribution to the fron@@ t@@ loading operation , and given that Parliament will contribute almost EUR 43 million instead of EUR 40 million , which is what the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets decided on Monday evening , I propose that an amount of EUR 35 million should be taken back in 2003 .
The promotion of the third system could contribute to an increased demand for and supply of these services and one , moreover , which could help close the employment gap most among the very social groups where it is greatest .
. Mr President , we are bringing to the final debate this report on Turkey at a special moment .
I do not consider that capital punishment has any place in the 21st century and support today &amp; apos ; s call for a moratorium on executions .
Those who are involved in such projects , and national governments , should also be creative in drawing on budgetary resources , corporate social responsibility and private don@@ ations to find the means , at the end of day , of doing what we should all like to be done .
It is not for the Commission to tell political groups what decisions they should make on the amendments that have come from the different political groups and therefore the Commissioner should not be placed in this invi@@ di@@ ous position .
Sh@@ ame on us in the European Union for not stamping out racism and xenophobia which are endemic in my country and in the EU in general .
We do not have the mechanism by which environmental law and policy can be enforced throughout the Union partly because that is still done by the nation @-@ states states .
We hold a regular Human Rights Dialogue with the Vietn@@ am@@ ese Government , covering all key areas of concern , for example , freedom of religion , freedom of expression , the use of the death penalty , and the situation in the Central Highlands .
I wish to refer to the disgraceful demonstration that took place in the Foreign Affairs Committee of this Parliament yesterday morning when the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs was involved in discussions with us .
The Commission believes that major progress has been made in recent years in the contribution and role of the EU in civil protection .
I would once again express my thanks to Mr van der Waal and the Committee on Transport , and would apologize to you , Mr President , if the complexity of the subject has caused me to go beyond my allotted speaking time .
The new Treaty also improves the powers of the European Parliament in other respects .
We are committed to taking appropriate measures in conformity with the agreement , including , if necessary , the suspension of the agreement with Turkmenistan , in case of a violation of human rights , as stipul@@ ated in the agreement .
Over five million Europeans have already lost their jobs , and far too many will still face unemployment .
Let us hope , however , that the signature of the memorandum in S@@ harm el @-@ She@@ ik@@ h She@@ ik@@ h will reinvigorate the peace process and ensure that the outstanding issues on final status are tackled without great delay .
Here we can show that Europe can and does deliver real benefits to our citizens .
Nevertheless , I hope that the organizations dealing with animal welfare in the European Union will forge closer links with their counterparts in third countries so that we can establish another form of contact between the people who have to implement the law .
This has been explicitly admitted by government ministers at a national government level and is something against which we must take a stand as a parliament .
The proposal ensures uniformity in the implementation of the control policy , while respecting the diversity and the specific characteristics of different fleets .
In broad terms , we must welcome these controls , but we have to be careful that we do not over @-@ regulate regulate .
Re@@ ally , is it not time to reconsider and to make a proper impact assessment on these proposals ?
I must stress that the Commission takes this incident very seriously indeed .
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives .
It was necessary to threaten the Commission with the s@@ ack in order to ensure that Parliament &amp; apos ; s demands for more scrutiny of budgetary procedures and financial management were met , and to force the Commission to undertake a root @-@ and and @-@ branch branch review of the Commission &amp; apos ; s management of taxpayers &amp; apos ; money .
If services like education , health and security have value , I guess that you have to find ways to finance them .
Often the agency jobs are lower @-@ skilled skilled jobs , so those nur@@ ses do not even have the advantage of gaining specialist skills while they are in Europe .
Member of the Commission . - The question raised by the honourable Member is very important for consumers , telecom service providers and content providers , and of course also for telecom regulators .
There are a lot of safeguards that the Commission has put in here that the Council has carefully discussed and I very much hope that we will fully support the Council common position on this matter .
Others say that in order to have a fishing industry at all we need to conserve , they har@@ k back to the 1996 article in Na@@ ture warning of the collapse of cod stocks .
I therefore call upon the Commission to be our ally in this reform .
A@@ round 80 per cent of EU money is actually spent in the Member States .
This is the mistake that we are now making with regard to the current financial crisis : it is serious , it does require action , but many of the proposed solutions will have far @-@ reaching reaching and , in my view , highly damaging effects for the long @-@ term term future of Europe .
This mechanism has had a considerable effect in mitigating the effects of the crisis .
My view , and indeed it was the view of Parliament , is that if Member States insist on enhanced security measures , they should at least contribute towards the costs .
This makes it easy for the public to access and loc@@ ate information and is very welcome .
In our approach at European level , including where appropriate through legislation , we should reflect the principle that economic and social policies can and should be mutually reinforcing .
It is an important tool , particularly for small- and medium @-@ sized sized businesses .
This is unfortunate because the cooperation that is being given by the fishermen to the Commission is a shining example to other parts of the European Union .
Finally , the Israelis and the Palestinians must also calm the situation and de @-@ escalate escalate the conflict .
The condition for a strong , coherent foreign policy is democratic legitimacy , which can only be provided by the strong involvement of the European Parliament .
The rapporteur &amp; apos ; s proposal that there should be very clear definitions as to when such products should be allowed for use , should be supported .
The fact needs to be borne in mind that the Fis@@ cali@@ s programme as it stands has not really been properly evaluated yet and it would not , therefore , be a good idea to carry it forward on this basis .
Member of the Commission . - I shall be very brief because I touched upon this in my first intervention .
Let me end by repeating once more my conviction that the SURE Committee report is a good input into the discussion about the future of the European Union , and a strong , important point of reference for the Commission .
( Applause from Mr Kinnock ) Six months after the Commission set out its plans in a White Paper , Parliament is ready to give its opinion .
I am also aware that this Parliament , through the various resolutions adopted since 2002 , has consistently expressed its opinion on that particular problem .
This incident is yet another reminder that freedom of speech continues to be absent in some regions of the world .
They have to be controlled .
It is important that the statements made in this House are not just made in a vacuum and that we send a message out to the wider world that we in the European Parliament are willing to be visionary and to bring the world into the 21st century by guaranteeing equality of rights for all ; and , in particular , by putting in place special protection programmes for those who suffer violence .
Despite the hard line of the Council , which is shared by the Commission - something I regret because it is not its constitutional position to do so - Parliament insists on its position .
The advice we have is clear .
The lessons of the failed Seattle Ministerial were that the WTO must become a fully democratic and transparent organisation which genuinely supports sustainable development and which effectively responds to the needs of developing countries .
We must apply the same terms , conditions and principles .
The recommendation would now require Member States to report to the Commission on the operation within two years .
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria .
We have done this in terms of information policy , where we have seen a remarkable change @-@ around around by the Commission in its willingness to come to some radical decisions on how information policy should be developed .
Certainly the British people , and the people of many other countries , do not wish to sub@@ sume their nation@@ hood into some state called Europe .
Thirdly , to create a clear and favourable environment for the mainly small and medium @-@ sized sized companies working in this sector .
We will assess the need to set an overall target for resource efficiency in the context of the review of the resource strategy planned for 2010 .
However , that does not mean one should not take all the necessary precau@@ tions and steps to deal with the public health threat as well .
It is important that we be seen to ensure that the reform is on track , and that means these issues being dealt with much further in advance than we are now once again seeing .
We therefore need to increase our aid to the global fund that is responsible for a very large proportion of the work to combat tuberculosis , malaria and HIV in the poorer areas of the world .
I think it is important to understand , however , the perspective of my committee .
Finally , I would add that , from the outset , this Commission was given a green light to address the fundamental rights of citizens , and I was looking forward to seeing something very specific on those issues in the plan for next year .
In the future , we could consider ways of enlarging the scope and having the European Parliament &amp; quot ; s concerns better reflected in these actions .
Why do we not go for that instead of making a common EU military force ?
I would like to take a couple of key points that colleagues have mentioned , especially my two shadow rapporteurs .
We are now beginning to see the effects of unemployment and of deficits , so there is a risk that such inequalities will grow worse .
We believe that the original text is better and stronger .
We also have in Scotland a significant offshore oil and gas resources , and it is essential that we maintain a set of economic circumstances which will encourage exploration and full extr@@ action of that resource .
I welcome this because it shows the way to the future in our budgetary debates .
I realise that it is hard to bring the positions from so many different political and national backgrounds into line , but the votes in committees involved show that the reports have been met with wide support .
The conclusions of the Berlin Summit asked this Parliament to deal with the nomination of Mr Prodi and the new Parliament to deal with the ratification of the entire new Commission .
Many Member States currently have this quality of decision @-@ making making , and it is extremely important .
Mr President , the enlargement process is the bridge from the old Europe to the new .
Firstly , we need to ensure that we consolidate our friend@@ ships with those allies with whom we wish to act together against American unilateralism .
Second , while the EU has created great wealth , it is now am@@ as@@ sed less honestly and spread less fairly .
I welcome this balanced report which explo@@ res the ways in which the growing popu@@ larity and number of Fair Trade products in the EU could contribute to our attempts to end social injustice and raise the standards of production in developing countries .
My hope is that this can be concluded in the weeks ahead so that it would be in place ahead of any post @-@ Bonn Bonn conference and could help to shape discussions there .
Their processing needs to take place with all urgency , and the international community should be invited to help .
It shows , as the rapporteur said , that there is a 20 @-@ 25 25 % difference between male and female earnings on average in the European Union and that in some Member States the situation is much worse .
We will observe closely the follow @-@ up up of this conciliation .
We want to make it a realistic single permit that will really work for all Member States and will stand the test of time .
We have also undertaken important activities to counter the terrorist abuse of the Internet , addressing conditions conducive to terrorist radicalisation , launching a European programme for the protection of critical infrastructure , and limiting access by terrorists to the means they need to commit their acts - funding and explosi@@ ves .
We need to create dynamic cities that respect people and the environment and involve community groups in the planning and process and in regeneration processes as such .
The Commission can accept the amendments which aim to clarify and improve the wording of the initial text in relation to partly completed craft and weather conditions , as well as those concerning the simplification of the noise @-@ testing testing procedures .
I would urge the Commission to revisit the issue of the Code .
However , in recent times , the value of the euro currency has substantially increased as political and economic stability within the European landscape has re @-@ emerged emerged .
The ban on some foods would be better addressed by working with the food industry to improve its products and safeguard jobs , rather than blaming the advertising industry for something it does not control .
The euro is an example of what Europe can achieve when it seriously shares sovereignty .
I welcome much of what the Commission has put forward , along with Mr Goepel &amp; apos ; s report .
Many colleagues have also raised questions about the desirability of separating the ex ante responsibility for budget control from the ex post responsibility for budget implementation or formulation within the Commission .
So I will remind Parliament and the Commissioners , as culture spokesmen do every year , that perhaps we have not got our priorities quite right .
It was NATO forces that protected the rest of Europe from this nightmare .
Mr President , as previous speakers have said , precisely what to do to give regional and local authorities a higher profile and standing is proving to be controversial under the Convention .
I believe that the Nordic Council has already played such a role : it has been used as the model for the Regional Cooperation Council for South @-@ Eastern Eastern Europe , based in Sar@@ aj@@ evo , which is now the forum for regional political cooperation in the Western Balkans .
It is of critical importance to mainstream the use of renewable energy including wind , hy@@ dro , various solar technologies and others .
Most importantly , we have also seen developments on the ground .
We have been quite careful in calibr@@ ating and prioritising what we are doing with the aim of getting as close as possible to the biggest groups in need affected by the conflict in Chechnya .
Secondly , a military solution to the Afghan im@@ bro@@ g@@ lio is not possible .
I have one short set of further points to make before I conclude .
In principle , the creation of websites in the EU Member States that could be used to search out and find missing children could be an appropriate subject for funding using one of the relevant funding programmes .
That is also clear so I think that we are looking forward to working towards the right formula on that .
When such actions are taken in compliance with WTO rules , we cannot and should not complain , and we do not .
There is also a human rights dialogue and all the security issues are there and are being discussed .
All in all it remains a good resolution , containing many good messages regarding the Kyoto Protocol , limits to offsets and criticism of L@@ U@@ L@@ U@@ C@@ F and A@@ AU loopholes as well as strong language on the historical responsibility of industrialised countries and the need to finance developing country climate efforts .
In June , the summit should set itself a ren@@ de@@ z@@ vous with a clear decision towards the end of 2007 , to establish a fresh intergovernmental conference with the purpose of modifying and improving the Treaty .
We have had a lot of difficulties with this report , on the whole question of how much money we should go for and over what period of time , and what the role of the taskforces should be .
It falls to the Commission to state clearly what the Constitution says , why it says it , and what the outcome will be if it is not brought into force .
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union .
A lot has been made in this debate of the apparent unanimity of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in supporting Mr D@@ ary &amp; apos ; s report .
I wish to thank him for his efforts in endeavouring to steer this report through Parliament and doing such a comprehensive job , and also to congratulate the Commission on having the foresi@@ ght to bring this forward , particularly in the light of what we have just been saying about liberalization and the very important comments the Commissioner made about the need to underpin liberalization with a very strong social framework .
Again both the Council and the Commission have indicated a willingness to accept those amendments .
As Vice @-@ Chair Chair of the Delegation for relations with Canada , I even had to witness , at one point , a situation where Canada acted as a mediator between the European Union and the United States .
I think this is very important , and I hope very much that this idea will be maintained in the future .
It is the first time that I have spoken before Parliament in the year 2008 .
How much is it related to the new approach from the Commission agreeing on different bilateral agreements and what will be part of this connection ?
It talks of the importance of health and safety at work , of the need to strengthen the prevention culture and to secure a better application of existing law .
There is both good and bad in the Council , but it is making progress and is , therefore , on the right path .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I would like to thank colleagues once again for their cooperation .
Here the Commission can fully support the changes aimed at clarifying the frequency ban@@ ds to be covered by the amending directive .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Madam President , I have realised that the distinguished Members of the Parliament are using their native languages .
I have been able to see this for myself and therefore I think we have to stress the importance of the idea of national envelopes in the Commission communication .
In order to obtain meaningful results , we must work in partnership - in partnership between the Commission and Parliament , to which I am grateful for consistent support for the policy ambitions put forward by the Commission in these areas ; in partnership with the Swedish Presidency of the Council , which I really congratulate for the hard work done ; and in partnership with our Danish friends preparing the Copenhagen conference .
We have a compromise text which , although not as ambitious as we would have liked , will lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions from vans and contribute to the EU &amp; apos ; s emission reduction ambitions for 2020 and beyond .
If you think about it , the big difference at the moment between European and national elections is that , when we vote in national elections , we go out to vote for or against a government , not for a parliament in isolation .
We can use this as an example and as a lesson .
I would like to hear the Commissioner today reassure us on a number of points .
In this instance I regard myself as a pragm@@ ati@@ st , I want to ensure that the legislation is workable and does not impose crippling burdens on industry or on agricultural producers .
In Amendment No 4 we are calling for the adoption of specific measures by the Bureau and &amp; apos ; the evaluation of the report by the Committee on Budgets on the basis of a working document drafted by its rapporteur &amp; apos ; .
Finally , may I , too , join with the President in wishing those Members who are retir@@ ing well in their future careers , whatever they might be .
The majority of irregular immigrants that reach Malta come from sub @-@ Saharan Saharan Africa and are economic immigrants .
However , regrettably , given that I have five minutes to wind up this debate , now is probably not the time to further explore those particular issues .
Madam President , I wish to support my colleague - even though he is Scottish - S@@ tru@@ an Ste@@ venson .
With regard to Mrs Estrela &amp; apos ; s comprehensive work on the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal for a strengthened maternity leave directive , we are indeed trying to strike a very difficult balance .
We fully share the concern of the honourable Member over recent expul@@ sions of Catholic pri@@ ests and , as the honourable Member will know , other Christian denomin@@ ations have been affected recently as well .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I should like to thank colleagues very much for their remarks .
L@@ ess@@ ons from the past have been learnt . &amp; apos ;
Yesterday when we were discussing the Guantánamo prison , here in the Chamber , I and several other speakers were interrupted without mer@@ cy when we had exceeded our speaking time by a few seconds .
Therefore , I support this proposal and recommend to the Council that it should give careful consideration to this report .
I agree with Commissioner Patten that the future Palestinian State must be territori@@ ally contigu@@ ous and viable and not pe@@ p@@ pered by Israeli settlements , whilst clearly the right of return needs delicate handling .
I just wonder whether my colleagues would agree with me how disappointing it is that there has not been much support for a written declaration which is being sponsored by my colleague from the West Midlands , Malcolm Harbour , who is the Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
Ste@@ ps in this direction have been taken to increase Member States &amp; apos ; support in the authorising process .
Mr President , like Mr Brinkhorst I am also speaking in two capacities , firstly on behalf of the committee , and secondly on behalf of the Socialist Group .
Both countries now have a major responsibility in determining whether or not the international community takes an important step in combating climate change .
I think what we do with the Millennium Development Goals and the work that we are doing in collaboration in bringing development together is going to be so important for that in the future .
Some Member States , such as France , have been doing well , but the problem is that there is a divergent level of funding across Member States .
It will not lead to increased spending by the Union ; it will provide a more transparent procedure for the sort of spending that already takes place via the political groups .
As we are seeing today , and as we will see in the future , the Non @-@ Proliferation Proliferation Treaty needs to be revised and updated .
We are seeing a situation where the most powerful country in the world has made clear its determination to wage war against Iraq , with or without United Nations backing and whether or not the weapons inspectors find any weapons of mass destruction .
However , the UK already has equality legislation and can change and improve it as and when required to by our Parliament and people .
The price differences within the European Union usually exceed the price differences between EU Member States and the United States .
After all , the process of peace has been slow and patch@@ y , and has resulted in numerous initiatives , numerous intergovernmental conferences - Madrid , Oslo and so on .
Even though the text is not ideal , representing the result of complex negotiations , as far as the new position is concerned my understanding is that it is important to continue discussion of the new document and of often disputed issues such as racial discrimination , xenophobia , sti@@ g@@ m@@ atisation and stereo@@ ty@@ ping of people based on their religion or belief .
I agree with the points Mrs L@@ alu@@ mi@@ ère has made on the current un@@ suitability of the nature of the partnership and cooperation agreements to be signed by these countries .
I find it absolutely outrageous that in the 21st century in the European Parliament there are still disagreements about something as natural as equal treatment of people .
This is not a second @-@ best best option ; on the contrary , it would give Turkey most of the benefits of full membership with few of the costs .
Your votes , colleagues , in favour of my report in full , as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee , will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland &amp; apos ; s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others .
Concerning other countries of the Western Balkans , very considerable progress has been made towards EU membership over recent years but this has also been uneven and huge challenges remain .
Indeed that is stressed in paragraph 8 of the General Affairs Council &amp; apos ; s comments on international cooperation .
The communication encourages the setting up of a transatlantic assembly .
I continue to see this as the leading motive of this report , for which I thank the rapporteur and my colleagues who contributed their thoughts .
There was a clear recognition both of the challenges that Europe faces in the face of globalisation and that different courses have been set , in the face of those challenges , by individual Member States .
During the ongoing codecision procedure for adoption of the programme decisions , both Parliament and the Council have supported the Commission &amp; quot ; s aim to achieve maximum simplification , not only in the form of the programme actions but also in their administrative and financial requirements , and to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use on the one hand and clarity of purpose and appropriate financial and procedural safeguards on the other hand .
In future , structural funds should be properly financed , the structural funds should not be renation@@ alised and the transitional status should be made available to those regions that fall out of converg@@ ent status .
However , I can speak on the financial assistance to those affected .
in writing . - Bearing in mind that Frontex was , inter alia , set up to &amp; apos ; protect &amp; apos ; the EU &amp; apos ; s borders from so @-@ called called &amp; apos ; illegal &amp; apos ; migrants , we oppose the agency and its objectives .
The trouble is that we do not know what is happening in the Member States , and the proposals from the European Commission go only a very little way to improving that situation .
Finally , concerning the critics of the parliamentary ratification of the Lisbon Treaty , let me tell you I cannot understand how someone who has been elected to a parliament can call into question the parliamentary ratification of a treaty .
Therefore , all the demands made by this resolution to treat the detainees either as innocent by@@ stan@@ ders caught up in American cross@@ fire in Afghanistan or common @-@ law law criminals subject to due process are legally not sound , and not necessarily desirable either - particularly if we are to protect Europe &amp; apos ; s security and people from further attacks .
But you need to understand that it is essential that we achieve flexibility in the margins for the future .
I , in my inno@@ c@@ ence , assumed that this question would be answered by the Commissioner responsible for transport but I find it is in &amp; apos ; Other questions &amp; apos ; .
I hope that Parliament , in the report that it intends to draw up on the new control proposal , which I will be hopefully presenting to the college for adoption later this year , will give it its full support .
On the one hand I can see the advantage of opening up public procurement , but it is fraught with dangers and I hope the Commission will examine these issues .
This is a matter on which I have spoken on a number of occasions in recent weeks , and one that should be at the heart of the European agenda in the coming years .
Tom@@ orrow we will have a trialogue and , hopefully , we will try to get an agreement on a draft declaration .
. Mr President , I am delighted to present these two reports to you .
These should not be the big bo@@ ge@@ y@@ man for business that they are often portrayed as .
Last , but not least , how can we win in diversity if our slogan is , I mean , unity .
Mr President , this is a tragedy that does not bear talking about .
This is something we also wish to see as a result of this work .
We also totally share the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s view that the Council common position contains useful improvements to the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal .
That event changed the face of Europe and heral@@ ded a process of eman@@ cip@@ ation for our neighbours in central and eastern Europe which is ne@@ aring its conclusion .
More specifically , the committee has highlighted the need for an evaluation of the functioning and impact of the current GSP scheme .
We have a report about to go before this House in Brussels .
I think the European Parliament is putting down a firm marker regarding its ambitions for a European criminal justice area in the future , with the twin ambition of bringing criminals to justice and upholding the rights of defendants and victims .
Having a cross @-@ party party foundation , we would be able to identify particular cases which , on a broad basis , we would see as needing particular assistance , bypassing obstruc@@ tive governments or authorities or forces , to build capacity for those who are fighting for human rights .
Under the various insurance directives , for instance , non @-@ national national insurance companies are required to have an ag@@ ent in each Member State to deal with insurance claims that may occur in that Member State .
Having said that , I would just say thank you to my colleagues for their friend@@ ship , their support and their messages in recent weeks .
For us , this is also the start of a process over the next five years of monitoring and sustaining political interest and pressure on all the Member States to deliver this directive .
In spite of this , the international community , as such , has a duty to assist the victims of the situation , and the Commission has up to now approved humanitarian aid operations , as I have already mentioned , amoun@@ ting to EUR 2@@ 2.@@ 5 million .
The EU did not listen then and it has not listened since .
While we are debating here today the issue of the rebate which the European Union gives the British Government on an annual basis , this matter should now be put into its overall context .
The authorities there deemed these vessels to be too dangerous to break up in the US and it seems to me quite incredible that they would then be transported 4 500 miles across the Atlantic and through EU waters to be disposed of in the UK .
I ask you , therefore , to gain an assurance from the Council that it will be present .
In light of the persi@@ sting gap between men and women in terms of employment rates , working hours , wages and access to management positions , I call on Member States to better implement anti @-@ discrimination discrimination and anti @-@ harassment harassment practices .
Finally , and this is extremely important , I want cordi@@ ally to ask honourable Members , for the sake of Europe , not to weaken our negotiating position by postponing assent to the protocol .
We really need to bring home to our own Member States that this is a travel document of Parliament , the Commission and of the Union and should be fully respected .
We are now approaching the time when the single currency will be introduced in the other Member States .
There is still significant scope both at the level of political dialogue and the financing of support programmes .
In recent weeks , speakers from the Council of Europe , for example , have raised various concerns and asked us to adopt in full various recommendations presented by the Council of Europe .
The decision of Member States to make the Union an area of freedom , security and justice should provide a basis for urgency in tackling a growing terrorist challenge .
Member of the Commission . - I would like to thank you for the comments and for drawing attention to other funds apart from those I already mentioned : the Mic@@ ro@@ finance Facility , the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
Because of our existing financial regulation , it is extremely difficult for us to provide support to UN organisations for example , for programming - we have to focus on projects - and that means that there is sometimes an extremely uncertain profile in our funding of organisations like the UNHCR .
Moreover , the Office can help by coordinating the deployment of officials from other Member States to Member States under particular pressure .
All political leaders in both governments , but especially those in Northern Ireland itself , bear a heavy responsibility .
There are none !
If those are the principles of soci@@ alism and liber@@ alism , they are deeply undesirable in this place .
I also welcome the recognition of the international community &amp; apos ; s responsibility to protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity , as well as the clear responsibility of each individual state to protect their own citizens from these crimes .
Whether the Council respects our rights and our prerogatives remains to be seen .
Finally , a word on procedure .
Mr President , we are delighted that there will be a statement on Wednesday evening from Commissioner Špidla on information and consultation .
But it is also to make sure that there is an adequate settlement system without too much risk of people being deprived of their due payments under the European Monetary Union settlement system .
Mr President , I should like to make a few comments on the report .
Every day , reports reach us of even more cases of arrests , torture and killings of innocent civilians by the authorities of Iran .
We must fight terrorism in all its forms and we must say &amp; apos ; No &amp; apos ; to any more appe@@ as@@ ement .
I trust that all governments will be urged to accept that necessity .
We also need a permanent financial stability mechanism capable of evolving over time , subject to governance and priorities .
Mr Gahler raised a number of points which were not connected to this debate and I would just like to suggest to him that if he w@@ rit@@ es me a quick note about those issues I am happy to come back to him , but I did not want to take Parliament &amp; apos ; s time this evening on issues that were not on this debate itself .
In fact , the draft changes would deepen the European Union &amp; apos ; s relationship with the nuclear armed Western European Union and pave the way for the eventual merger between the two bodies .
You know that I support the introduction of this card .
It serves no useful purpose to inflame tensions on this issue , which is why my group has tabled amendments to Mr Brok &amp; apos ; s report to seek to lower the temperature of the debate .
We must ensure that we not only pay lip service to the disabled this year , but also give particular emphasis to those who cannot speak for themselves , and mostly that means the elderly disabled .
Moldova really has to promote respect for human rights .
We made it voluntary for the Member States to give the resources that they were able to give .
Let me make myself clear : I believe that the Commission has worked long and hard to ensure that the draft agreement strikes a balance between the rightful concerns to protect personal privacy and the need to increase security in the air for all passengers across the Atlantic .
No @-@ one one would hold up the existing structure of the Treaties as a model of their kind and it must be in the interests of the politician , administr@@ ator , business@@ man and citizen to simplify their structure .
I think in relation to agreements with third world countries one needs to strike a balance .
It seems that there is now widespread agreement on the levels of the targets .
S@@ eri@@ ous decisions will have to be taken on the farming structures of the future .
in writing . - How to bring Europe closer to citizens and how to bring citizens closer to Europe is one of the main issues under discussion probably since the beginning of the European Community .
The objective of cur@@ tail@@ ment of time limits under the regulatory procedure with scrutiny included in the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 3@@ 96 / 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission is to complete the process from application for a maximum residue level to adoption within less than one year .
The reason for the position of the Commission is that the risk assessment for these substances is not yet finalised .
In addition the Commission , as well as being the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the North Caucasus through ECHO , has agreed a EUR 20 million programme for socio @-@ economic economic recovery there - a clear indication of our willingness to be actively involved in the process of strengthening democracy and stability in the region .
Having said that , I note that paragraph 6 refers to Europe &amp; apos ; s smaller nations &amp; apos ; whose economy may be seen as not &amp; quot ; indispensable &amp; quot ; for the purposes of safeguarding the euro area as a whole &amp; apos ; .
( Mur@@ mu@@ rs ( of dissent ) ) I am going to return to the presidency because that is what I am expected to speak on .
We must not lose sight of the basic objective .
A@@ mon@@ g@@ st other things , this involved a European arrest warrant , joint investigation teams , Eurojust and legislation on terrorist financing .
Speaking with one voice is very good , but now we have to get our proactive diplomacy in place .
Can the Council make a comprehensive statement outlining how the EU peacekeeping mission to Chad is progressing at this time ?
The European economic recovery measures before us constitute an important package , and I applaud the strong emphasis on green jobs and technologies that will help reduce our carbon emissions and promote energy security .
I should like to thank you all for a very substantive and responsible debate , which clearly shows that this House fully supports the prospects for European integration of the Western Balkans and Kosovo .
I regret that the Member States have not taken up the Commission &amp; apos ; s communication more actively .
Thank you for your statement on behalf of the Council and your support for the Commission &amp; apos ; s programme .
However , I recognize that we have serious ethical considerations in this directive .
I have followed the negotiations very closely , determined to ensure that we reached a good agreement .
I urge Parliament to debate soon the proposal for radio spectrum policy and thus send out a strong signal on the importance and the urgency of the matter .
We should not build a service which preserves the old national competition or the present bureaucratic structure .
I repeat the Commission &amp; quot ; s readiness to provide funds for reconstruction and rehabilitation in the north Caucasus , as soon as the security situation permits , and once a needs assessment mission to Moscow and the north Caucasus can be undertaken .
The Council was not going to agree to anything more at this stage .
This burden , as the Commissioner has just said , must be reduced and the procedures simplified .
This proposal is the follow @-@ up up to one of my first commitments to improve food safety and provides for a system to exchange information in the field of animal nutrition , with particular reference to a rapid alert system and a legal basis to enable the adoption of safeguards measures for products produced within the Community and also the obligation for the Member States to have in place contingency plans to deal with feed emergencies .
Actually , I believe it is a major impediment to saving the euro , is it not ?
That needs to be reviewed .
Therefore , whilst that may be welcomed in certain parts of this House , it would have had a devastating effect on postal services throughout the European Union .
In the long @-@ term term , however , it could only be detrimental to the position of women in general .
Of course we are very much in favour of openness and transparency .
In Tampere , as Minister R@@ aj@@ am@@ äki and Mr C@@ av@@ ada have just said , we also discussed how to improve decision @-@ making making in the field of security and justice , in particular by using the &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; or &amp; apos ; bridging clause &amp; quot ; .
Madam President , let us be clear about Mr Leinen &amp; apos ; s report : it is not about democracy , it is about propaganda , it is about using the taxes collected from our reluctant citizens to drive forward a European project about which they are increasingly uneasy .
The Quality Charter for Criminal Justice in Europe should not be something that Member States fear .
The WHO is supporting measures in this field , the N@@ SP@@ CC is and I certainly hope my colleagues will vote for it .
The honourable Member is no doubt aware that the Council has been actively considering the issue and that the Commission has produced several staff working papers on the technical aspects at the request of the Council .
We have repeatedly called on all parties to refrain from politici@@ sing the issue , and to act only with the best interests of the Roma families in mind .
I believe that we are on a sli@@ pper@@ y sl@@ ope here .
But it is a vital matter for British business , especially at a time of immense pressure arising from the economic downturn , when maximum flexibility and less regulation , not more , is key to economic recovery .
In other words , the credibility of the Human Rights Council as such is at stake , and we should therefore do everything we can to maintain the Human Rights Council &amp; apos ; s authority .
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their solidarity which includes their presence here tonight , my own assistant L@@ au@@ ra Su@@ l@@ li@@ van , the consumer NGOs and the Council Presidency , all of whom have brought us to a position where we can tonight demonstrate that the total support in Council is overwhelmingly re@@ plic@@ ated in Parliament .
It has followed this by demanding more resources for those committees .
The Commission considers that all three components of the scheme - the standard GSP for all beneficiaries , the &amp; apos ; GSP Plus &amp; apos ; for those countries that make specific commitments in terms of adherence to international standards for good governance and sustainable development , and the Everything But Arms initiative for the least @-@ developed developed countries - are operating well and in line with the overall policy orientations put in place for the period 2006 @-@ 2015 2015 .
Europe is a community of values - values which I know are shared by the majority of our Lithuanian fellow citizens .
The contempt we show for public opinion makes a mo@@ ck@@ ery of our claim to be a &amp; apos ; Union of V@@ alu@@ es &amp; apos ; .
Mr President , it is clear that the larger eurozone governments have no intention of t@@ ying their hands by promising to adhere to the 3 % deficit limit .
Take immigration , for instance : the limitations of the Barcelona Process on immigration have turned into a massive problem at the door of European Union Member States .
You are now in the process of debating the package , which gives the opportunity for a collective rethink , also bearing in mind the experience of the past couple of months .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.@@ 25 a@@ .@@ m. and resumed at 11.@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m. )
It is our hope and expectation also that the Committee on Petitions will automatically be asked for an opinion in good time on such issues in future .
This is not the end of the process , but it is a huge step forward .
How we react and how the parties position themselves will have a determining influence on the prospects for moving towards what I hope will be a peaceful solution to the Israeli @-@ Palestinian Palestinian conflict .
As I said , I know that this Parliament has been deeply pre@@ occupied with the crisis in Gaza , and so have we all .
Nobody wants to punish industry because the car industry , as Mr Harbour has just said , is a major European industry ; it is a major employer and we have to work with them because only they can deliver these changes that we need to see .
For far too long the Commission or the Council , holding its meetings in secret and expressing solidarity very often between themselves about these issues , have covered up what we really need to know about future policy on immigration , asylum , refugees , etc . , within the Community .
Mr President , this is a point of order .
This issue goes far beyond individual families and goes right to the heart of the Union &amp; apos ; s respect for its own laws and treaties .
We encourage newly acceding states to continue their efforts for the final two months until accession : now is not a time to rest on their o@@ ars .
In the first instance this requires greater efforts to ensure that funds already promised are spent in a timely and effective manner .
We know transport is one of the areas where CO2 emissions must be reduced , and it is my hope that the revision of this directive can be signed off as soon as possible so that it can be implemented by 2010 as a support for environmentally conscious local authorities and public bodies .
I have no doubt that the Budgetary Control Committee will ensure that it exerci@@ ses its responsibilities in future and will want to report in the future on how the recommendations in this report are being implemented and dealt with .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report , which endorses plans to liberalise air transport arrangements between the EU and the United States of America .
I welcome today &amp; apos ; s oral question by N@@ ei@@ l Parish , Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , because we want to see whether this regulation works .
The European Union has demonstrated that it is incapable of speaking with a single voice , whilst some Member States have shown more interest in creating a counter@@ weight to the United States , than in building a genuine transatlantic partnership based on common values .
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track .
Commissioner , you have failed to answer my question .
That is why European Liberal Democrats have consistently supported measures like the European arrest warrant , unlike British Conservatives who sp@@ out hot air on law and order but oppose EU cooperation instruments .
Does the Commission envisage additional Member States gaining quota in areas where they have none at the moment - for example , in the North Sea ?
Coun@@ tering terrorism is in large measure countering poverty .
We also place great emphasis on the question of democratic accountability .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , we all know that the situation in Gaza is dramatic .
We must ensure that any new legislation does not stand in the way of these important European fundamental rights .
We have made real headway in south east Europe .
I think in the work that I did at the UN last week I have demonstrated my personal commitment to the power of multilateral action .
It is also true that in some cases negotiations per se , in particular with pro@@ tracted deadlines , serve only the purpose of the other side .
It is a tactic we have decided to use in future years as well .
Mr President , on behalf of the Environment Committee , I welcome Mr Maat &amp; apos ; s excellent report .
They depend on agricultural exports .
Indeed , juvenile violence and violence against women are issues that we find have to be there because we have to all do everything in order to diminish violence in society .
That is why many of us in the interinstitutional working group have been urging you in the European Commission to think about how you could extra@@ pol@@ ate your excellent work in the impact assessment field and urge all institutions to sign up to similar practices .
The other problem she , as rapporteur , has highlighted is that of how to deal with a breach of non @-@ custodial custodial conditions , and of which Member State - the issuing Member State or the executing Member State - should be responsible for imposing the sanction for that breach .
The Commission does have a role to play on its own in this area .
I am thinking , in particular , about a European year on combating all forms of violence against women , for which we are currently collec@@ ting citizens &amp; apos ; signatures .
Europe &amp; apos ; s unemployed are no longer prepared to be sacrific@@ ed in the name of a more &amp; apos ; advanced union &amp; apos ; .
Mr President , I am persuaded that the fact Kosovo was already a UN protec@@ torate , that the solution is supported by the UN Secretary @-@ General General , and that negotiations had failed , all mean that Kosovo is a unique case in our world .
So the Commission can agree with Amendments 1 to 5 , but we cannot agree , for the reasons which I have already explained , to Amendments 6 and 7 .
Having just finished a major reform treaty process , a reform package , we are told , would close the book on treaty change for a generation .
It is all about empowering the European Union and boosting the role of the European Commission in particular .
In looking at the detail of the report , there are three basic points that I would like to highlight .
It will be very difficult for both the Commissioner and the speakers to combine two subjects that are so different in nature , and it is therefore worth questioning whether it is reasonable to plan the debate as it has been planned on the agenda .
It is necessary to analyse all 27 pension systems in the EU .
Having said that , the Commission has certain obligations under the Euratom Treaty .
We hope that this debate and the welcome support from Parliament will make it possible for Member States to accept what we have proposed .
on behalf of the S &amp; amp ; D Group . - Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner .
So I am not going to respond again to all these questions that have been put because , honestly , I think I already answered them in my first speech .
In answer to Mr Kindermann &amp; apos ; s question on how we can ensure that Member States carry out their work properly , first of all it is the primary role of the authorities in the Member States to carry out their functions and to comply with the legislation .
However , in many areas the Commission proposal was ambiguous and may have the opposite effect to that which the Commission is seeking .
This report is therefore very timely , as the EU currently has to deal with a crisis .
I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their work .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , my Group supports this proposal , and thinks this is a practical set of adjustments to the current legislation and that it is actually useful that European political parties should have the ability to do research and so on through their foundations and have the flexibility to carry money over from one year to the next and so on .
It is therefore important to ensure that copyright and neighbouring rights in this increasingly growing digital domain are managed properly to the benefit of all involved .
Madam President , thank you very much for that message of condol@@ ence , which is what I wanted to talk about concerning India .
Mr President , I would like to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur for this report .
You covered human right issues so I am certain we can find a compromise , but a little bit of work still needs to be done .
We all have to do that .
We should also like to know what conclusions can be drawn from the code of conduct that was established in 2006 , and how the Commission understands the future relationship between a potential directive and the code of conduct .
On the remark that was made , I would like to stress that this is not my initiative : it is a Commission decision that has been adopted and , irrespective of the persons involved , there will certainly be continuity .
Indeed , we want to stress that our view is well in line with the laws of Egypt itself and so we request the Egyptian Government to look at this again and to regulate the framework , so that opposition candidates can stand and perhaps even Dr N@@ our &amp; quot ; s judge might be reconsidered .
I would like to point out that the regulations that will apply to the structural funds will be up for approval before the Commission on 18 March and after that we will see how things progress .
One of the most difficult areas for any government or European institution to deal with is the very rapid change that is taking place in the global economic circumstances .
We need to act together ; we need to use the leverage of all our institutions and , if we act together like that , we will make a difference in the world for good .
I have great confidence in Commissioner Patten to lead this , and Commissioner Nielson , and I hope that they will get together and make sure that the EU &amp; apos ; s next decade is much better than the last 40 years , a period in which , I consider , much time and resources were wasted .
We are not just talking about commercial , economic or even geo@@ strategic interests .
The principles set out in that communication are essentially based on the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities , which remains , of course , the sole competent institution to provide a definitive interpretation of Community law .
That , at least , is very promising , and something on which we can build .
Agriculture is the key area where LDCs do not currently have access , yet it is precisely the area in which we see delays in relation to sugar , r@@ ice and bananas .
It is a very important concept of sym@@ bio@@ sis between political , civilian and security aspects of our lives .
She want speedi@@ er legislation . She is right .
I would like to end by mentioning two points .
We closely monitor the activities of that Council , and the European Parliament sends its missions to Geneva twice a year .
With regard to the Code of Conduct on Arms Ex@@ ports , many Members of Parliament mentioned the issue of the Code &amp; apos ; s status and stressed the importance of it being legally binding .
In the European Parliament , I wish to applaud the positive and supportive role of the European Union in this process .
Through these actions by the European institutions and Member States , we hope to shar@@ p@@ en the focus and step up efforts on network and information security as a vital measure to prevent illegal interception or economic es@@ pion@@ age , underpinning the smooth functioning of our economies and societies .
I can only hope that there is sufficient goodwill in the Commission and in this House to ignore the di@@ thering and mismanagement of our government .
. I wish to record my support for this report as a major step forward in facilitating the application of the &amp; apos ; polluter pays &amp; apos ; principle .
We are now well poised to begin the task of translating these ideas into effective solutions .
The reason why it is better than minimum harmonisation , as some of you proposed to discuss even today , is that we think that it is necessary to lower market @-@ entry entry barriers for financial services providers , and this is one of the main reasons why this proposal for a directive is going ahead .
That is why I am proud to be telling Parliament today and tomorrow that the PSE Group has made a compromise , following tough negotiations - which is as it should be on such an important matter - with the ALDE and PPE @-@ DE DE Groups .
Notwithstanding this , however , I believe that the political will now exists throughout the institutions to reach final agreement on this text quickly , thus putting in place a comprehensive framework for information and consultation throughout the Community .
Tr@@ ans @-@ European European networks have a crucial role to play in achieving and operating the single market and assisting European businesses to speedi@@ er access to that market for their goods and services .
In fact , certain developments within Ukraine are followed with a certain degree of concern by the EU .
In particular , I know that the committee &amp; apos ; s report - and I quote : &amp; quot ; welcomes generally the content and analysis within the thorough and more comprehensive 2000 report and commends the Commission and the E@@ IF where progress has been made &amp; quot ; .
Member of the Commission . - We are taking into account all the input that we are getting from our very open approach to this process .
in writing . - It is important that we have a strong and sustainable CAP and the ongoing work on its reform is one of the key issues before this Parliament .
If we do not find ourselves properly consulted and informed , where does that leave national parliaments and citizens ?
At the same time the European Neighbourhood Policy does not prejudge the future development of those countries &amp; apos ; relationships with the European Union , in accordance with our Treaty provisions .
The Commission undertook to report on its experiences after the first two years of application of these new rules , that is , by the spring of 2005 .
The European Union and its Member States now provide 55 % of total international aid and two thirds of global non @-@ re@@ fund@@ able re@@ fund@@ able aid .
We are now at the end of this process and tomorrow , you will be voting on this excellent report .
Frankly , that is much more important at this stage than who sits around the table at the first meeting .
There would in effect be a duplication of measures in different pieces of legislation each seeking to do the same thing , but in an inconsistent manner .
It seems sensible to simplify how we operate the funds .
It is reasonable to expect Member States to produce the sort of detail that is necessary for the European Commission both from the management point of view as well as that of accounting , to have exact details of where and to whom the money is going , down to the last recipient .
For around 70 other products , current legislation has introduced voluntary harmonisation to which Member States have adopted different approaches .
Given our separate legal institutions , it is essential that these powers are returned to the Scottish parliament so that Scotland can play a full role in the ongoing EU debate on these matters .
The President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office and President Prodi have described the workings of the Convention - this is not the Convention I have been attending .
This has been ampli@@ fied by the report but there is nothing new in it .
Security and defence , which are at the heart of the Common Foreign and Security Policy , are also properly and inevitably close to the hearts of Member States .
I am quite sure that when you are in contact with them , they will also recognise that we have had numerous meetings with these countries .
Sel@@ dom has the need for Euro / Atlantic unity been more vital .
The question is , do the Commission and Council accept their political priorities ?
This is an issue for the Council .
Although the Commission and Parliament agree on the fundamental aspects of the new regulation , there are certain issues where we have not managed to see eye to eye , and I would like to touch briefly on some of these .
Finally , I urge the colegislators to have an interinstitutional agreement as soon as possible between the Parliament , the Council and the Commission on the implementation of Article 290 , as there is an urgent need for greater transparency .
At what political level was the Commission represented on this committee ?
These two elements allowed the Council to come to a political agreement on its common position in December 2000 .
We fully share Parliament &amp; apos ; s concern , also expressed in its comments on the Instrument for Stability strategy , that a security gap in this important humanitarian field has to be avoided .
Fortunately , Members of this Parliament are protected by parliamentary privilege , but even then , Commissioner Kinnock , I would ask you to note the reasonably restra@@ ined language that there is in our resolution and if I may just quote to you briefly on what the resolution says - &amp; quot ; it deems his conduct to be particularly open to criticism &amp; apos ; .
At the outset , let me acknowledge the efforts that have been made by the rapporteur to respond to the legal order of the European Union .
The Netherlands presidency wishes to make its contribution to the success of this important Spring Council .
I support that arrangement and I voted &amp; apos ; for &amp; apos ; .
Indeed , the European Council is becoming increasingly inconsistent , and it is against that background that I very much welcome the overall approach of Mr Bourlanges .
The Commission counts on the help and support of the European Parliament in moving on with these issues so that , within the not too distant future , we can indeed establish a common asylum policy in the European Union .
I can assure you that the Committee on Research , Tech@@ nolog@@ ical Development and Energy will be looking very carefully at the ethical dimensions of the fifth framework programme .
I reject the technical steps that take the European Union closer into the tax affairs of Member States , just as I reject the ultimate objective of allowing the European Union to levy taxes on individuals in the European Union .
It is the Member States &amp; apos ; governments who decide on the method for ratification .
It is not just a question of focusing on this programme .
Are we seriously asking the candidate countries to ratify the Accession Treaty by referenda next year only to ask them a year later to ratify another EU treaty on more changes to the day @-@ to to @-@ day day operation of the Union ?
I understand and I share some of the concerns expressed about such a course of action .
We can really say that we are on the way to creating a European demos , a real public space for the citizens of Europe .
The PSE are har@@ ming consumer &amp; apos ; s rights by trying to divert attention away from the need for more determined actions at all levels to improve the enforcement of consumers &amp; apos ; rights , while ...
In the run @-@ up up to Copenhagen , big economies such as Indonesia , Mexico , Korea , India , South Africa and others - the list is much longer - set domestic targets .
We all know perfectly well too , that anti @-@ terrorist terrorist legislation such as proposed by these means do not guarantee a fair trial all over the EU .
in writing . - I voted against the joint motion on the Fourth United Nations conference on least developed countries because the motion is not focused enough on the problem of international aid in@@ effectiveness .
Ir@@ respective of the choices made by Member States , it is incumbent on us all to explain what is in the Constitution , and why it will be so beneficial for the Union , the Member States and especially our citizens .
It is incumbent upon the Member States to help us ensure that European taxpayers &amp; quot ; money is being spent correctly .
From the internal market point of view , the legal setting is not the same for those two types of taxes .
It should move from Brussels @-@ based based communication to a decentralised approach and from an acces@@ s@@ ory tool to a real European policy on an equal footing with other EU policies .
It represents a delicate and hard @-@ fought fought compromise , which would not have been achievable only a couple of years ago .
Mr President , as mentioned in 1989 , the Council and the Commission agreed that they had to address the harmonisation of the regulatory framework applicable to civil aviation in order to maintain a high level of safety and to ensure fair competition in the internal market .
Parliament , the directly elected representatives of the citizens of Europe , made a stand , proving that we MEPs are strong of will and not just a rubber stamp for the Commission .
We talk about mine clearance which is vastly important , and I appreciate all the work that has been going on as far as the European Union is concerned .
This is for me a very complicated question .
I share the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s views in paragraph 6 about the absence of any review of those famous task forces on which we spent so much committee time .
The White Paper underlines the importance of developing a true European political culture , with pan @-@ European European political groups , pan @-@ European European media and fora or meeting places where citizens can meet and discuss issues of common interest .
Equally , the EU has a moral duty to provide development and humanitarian aid to developing countries , even those with a lamentable human rights record , such as Pakistan where women and religious minorities in particular suffer from institutionalised discrimination .
rapporteur . - Mr President , like my colleagues , I agree that a political agreement is probable at the IGC in Lisbon .
Mr President , distinguished Members of Parliament , I appreciate your contributions , which were completely unequivocal .
Whilst the final version of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament is not perfect , we recognise the importance of sending a clear , unequivocal signal to those who threaten our way of life that we shall not succumb .
Last time Council might have claimed it lac@@ ked notice of that question .
Naturally we have to stay within the con@@ fines of the Treaty , so where the Treaty says &amp; quot ; directives &amp; quot ; we cannot use regulations .
I think it is an issue we need to raise .
Yet again this House calls on the Council to respond to its clearly expressed wish : real , effective actions against the Z@@ A@@ NU @-@ P@@ F P@@ F regime in Zimbabwe now .
Can this fine ambition be achieved ?
The way in which you have engaged the Bureau of Parliament , the Conference of Presidents , the committee chairs in your agenda , already in your first month , shows a determination to work across the whole of this House in order to deliver reform , and that is very encouraging .
We have tried to develop a political dialogue , which most recently has focused on our understandable concerns about whether Iran &amp; apos ; s nuclear ambitions for energy have turned into nuclear ambitions for military purposes .
More than half way through their term , I think some Commissioners can start to see the end of their own positions starting to loom .
If we are replacing or enhancing our legal system and access to justice , these issues are key to civil society and they cannot and must not be tackled without the input of democratically elected Members .
We must recognize the interdependence of our economies and the limits to the effectiveness of national policies , particularly in monetary policy .
We have been here before : both the French and the Dutch said &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; to a previous treaty and a mechanism was found to organise and advance the European project .
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union , and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate , with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country .
Amendments Nos 23 , 153 and 157 are not acceptable , because they remove the possibility for the authority to receive fees .
Having said all that I am a believer in subsidiarity .
The conclusions of the resolution closely reflect the Commission &amp; apos ; s intentions on how to revise general product safety rules in the EU .
However , the issue that arises is that there should not be a delay in making sure that treatment is available .
The manufacturers have made great technological progress over recent years .
I should like to congratulate the Committee on Culture , and in particular its rapporteur , Mr Hoppenstedt , for this comprehensive report on Ex@@ po 2000 H@@ anno@@ ver .
I have said since the time that I took up this position that it was my intention to make decisions on a science basis , examining the best scientific evidence available to me and making my decision on that basis .
It is clear , as the Commissioner said , that we need to address this in our development and aid policies .
Mr President , I also rise on a point of order .
Secondly , I want to clarify once again that we are not putting aside our hygiene regulations .
This is therefore not the time to enter into a full discussion on that issue . But I would say that we are facing a real challenge here .
For the Commission , I am glad to say that the trend is definitely moving in the right direction .
The rapporteur - the chairman of our committee - asked me to de@@ pu@@ tise for him tonight because I was the one that proposed that compromise , which is that we have a fourth vice @-@ chairman chairman of each parliamentary committee and a sixth Qua@@ est@@ or for the remainder of this Parliament , until 2009 , but that we do not make it a permanent change .
Your report further elabor@@ ates on the possibility of working on global standards , data protection and freedom of speech .
In relation to the PNR issue , it is extremely important that citizens have the right to data protection .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - I am very happy at this news .
Mr Salafranca and Mrs De Keyser have produced a very good report , but we simply have to pursue this issue .
It is not my intention today to respond to earlier comments in this House , although I just wish a lot of people would be aware of the full facts before they make some wild statements .
It has helped to convince firstly the Commission , and then even the minority on the Council which was reluctant to go along with this .
The theme of this report - which was prepared by the Presidency - was welcomed by the General Affairs Council last Monday .
The intention is that the European Council will ask the Commission to submit an action plan in 2005 with the measures to be adopted and related deadlines for the implementation of this multiannual programme .
This questionnaire has enabled the Commission to obtain a reasonably complete picture of the way in which the measures are being implemented , and this seems broadly satisfactory .
The European Court of Justice is not a court of justice , it is an eng@@ ine of political integration for the European Union .
Madam President , I voted in favour of postponing the final vote because I think there may be some possibility that we can reach agreement with the Council .
We must not establish new preconditions for membership that were not applicable to other potential members and we must remain clear that negotiations are for full membership and that that is our only goal .
Mr Swoboda , Mrs Wallis , Mrs Harms , Mrs Roth @-@ Berendt Berendt and Mr Rangel also took part in the work , and I would like to thank them very much for the outcome of the negotiations .
I hope and trust that when the Commission brings forward the directive which I understand it is considering , there will be a clear assurance that the contributors towards these huge funds will be involved .
Though Parliament believes that this strategy must develop synergies between relevant EU , national , regional and local policies , it calls on the Commission and the Member States to set up simplified rules to facilitate the implementation of this strategy and reduce the inherent administrative burden .
Memb@@ ership of the European Union involves serious surrender of sovereignty and an unwelcome intrusion of its laws into everyday life .
Sub@@ sidy competition would undermine Europe &amp; apos ; s cohesion , create damaging subsidy r@@ aces within our internal market , and bring serious risk of WTO litigation .
Here I am thinking of EU support for the elections early next year , activities relating to civilian crisis management - such as police training - and building up the skills of the judiciary .
The Commission is looking forward to seeing the draft report of the European Parliament and to starting trialogues .
Firstly , given the trau@@ ma which led to the collapse of the present Commission , we expect to hear a clear commitment - not just to implementing the programme of reforms already agreed by this Parliament and the current Commission in January and the subsequent agreement on the independent investig@@ atory body OLAF - but to further and deeper reforms of substance , in particular ( and I was glad to hear you mention it ) with regard to the acceptance of political and personal responsibility for work done by officials at whatever level in the European Commission .
I would like to address the main points raised by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs &amp; apos ; report prepared by Mr Bushill @-@ Matthews Matthews .
By trusting the outcome of this work , which confirms the previous evaluations , the Commission has , I believe , acted as a responsible risk man@@ ger , especially within the context of the legislation and the ap@@ por@@ tion@@ ment of responsibilities as I explained them during my introduction .
I think that is an appropriate way forward for this Parliament to be properly represented .
Mr President , Commissioner , in October 2000 , in Se@@ oul ASEM leaders gave a commitment to support human rights , democracy and the rule of law , as a cornerstone of future Asia / Europe cooperation .
We must ensure that prevention , detention and warning mechanisms for natural hazards in Europe and across the globe are robust and put our citizens - from Car@@ li@@ s@@ le to Kashmir - in the best position to prevent , prepare for and respond to disasters .
I wish I was as confident as the Commissioner that compliance with present legislation by companies is something we take for granted .
In order to be credible to this end , the EU must clearly clam@@ p down on its own tax havens first and go beyond the OECD framework .
Mr President , as you will be aware , last Monday my office received an incendi@@ ary bomb which was addressed to me but opened by my staff .
This recast was intended to improve matters .
The role of the ITS in the area of road safety will also be discussed during the informal meeting of transport ministers to take place in late April in Lit@@ om@@ ě@@ ř@@ ice in my country .
Some Member States are already much more ambitious in their national codes for energy efficiency , and I hope that this directive will encourage others to follow suit .
However , we cannot support the growing trend for harmonisation of criminal law within the EU and cannot therefore support this report .
In particular it has missed a rare opportunity to alter the political priorities and instead has continued to fund the traditional spending programmes .
This can be done relatively quickly .
Did we really think that we could shift the human rights agenda in Cuba by inviting a few dissidents to a party when 40 years of US embargo have failed ?
However , we have to work within the budget , and this is why I fully support Mr A@@ dam &amp; apos ; s proposal of EUR 25 and am confident that the Council will consider this proposal as a very viable option given the constraints .
This means Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 4 , 9 , 15 and the second part of Amendment No 24 .
On the human rights situation in Colombia , our attention has been drawn on a number of occasions to the murders of innocent civilians in Colombia .
I agree that Amendment No 13 contains good and sensible exemptions , but Amendment No 18 is also useful in the sense that it draws attention to my problem with the Chi@@ p@@ pend@@ ale chairs .
We are concerned by one aspect , however , of the European Union and the G20 &amp; apos ; s response .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , let me start by thanking rapporteurs Berès and Feio and the honourable Members for this very substantial and substantive debate .
First , there is this issue of the technical gas that the Ukraine needs to keep its transit system running .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I congratulate my group colleague and group Co @-@ President President Mrs Frassoni for a timely and well thought @-@ out out report .
However , I would like to put to her that in the real world , a Confederation of British Industry survey of over 200 companies in the United Kingdom , which has more temporary agency workers than any other country , indicates that her directive will result in 60 % of these companies employing fewer temporary workers .
We will not have one like the common agricultural policy .
That is an unacceptable state of affairs but we have to live with it for the sake of the people &amp; apos ; s Europe , in order to salvage something at least .
We had an open debate in the Council on drugs and the Commission intends to present two main instruments : one , the framework decision for harmonisation of criminal law in fighting drug trafficking , will be presented next month .
The amendment is , in my view , based on a misinterpretation of the article .
I welcome the approach taken , first by the Danish Presidency and now continued by the Greek Presidency , to much closer working relations with this House , shown in the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office &amp; apos ; s concern that a statute for Members should form part of the successful reform of the European Union institutions .
Unfortunately the national regulators do not have explicit powers to prevent or reduce the possibility of inadver@@ tent roaming .
The@@ reby the period after the elections would be essential , and so would the role of the president and the Z@@ an@@ u leaders , and they would hopefully contribute to a climate of reconciliation and calm .
If you wish to transform the system , today &amp; apos ; s vote will be the first mark of whether we are dedicated to transformation and change .
The planning process is a key element of sustainable development as , because it covers land @-@ use use , it sets the physical framework for the way in which we live .
It reached the following conclusion regarding the judiciary : &amp; apos ; Investig@@ ations in some high @-@ profile profile cases continued to raise concerns .
We welcome in particular the Commission &amp; apos ; s discussion paper which is the subject of Mr Provan &amp; apos ; s report .
I think we should work towards that situation and to reform the rules to ensure that the next time we are electing a Commission , each of them would be elected on merit .
in writing . - I voted for this resolution , although I cannot quite get the strong sm@@ ell of hypocrisy , on the part of the EU institutions , out of my no@@ str@@ ils .
The same applies to the old Member States , with the exception of Denmark , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and Sweden .
These organisations are the ones that we look to for the funding to create the dynamic economy that we want to develop in Europe .
We must make the UN and its international human rights conventions a contractual obligation of the stabilisation , association and accession process , starting with ourselves .
I am extremely satisfied with the way in which the rapporteur has dealt with all our contributions and concerns and congratulate him once again for his excellent work .
We want to achieve that and therefore we want to continue our efforts , even at the most difficult times .
I have no doubt that the honourable Member is sincere in his comments and I am respectful of the organisations that he consulted in preparing his contribution to this debate today , so I would be grateful if he could forward , both to the Commission and to the Council , the evidence he referred to in his question and I will ensure that it is passed on to the relevant officials .
I would like to mention one point where I regret that the Commission proposal was not supported by the Council , although we had your support .
That market is confined to the European Union .
The countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East are facing a broad range of challenges politically , economically and socially .
Conservatives will be voting against Parliament &amp; apos ; s main reports on the budgetary discharge of the European Parliament , the Commission , the Council , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the grounds that for the 12@@ th year running , the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance of the overall EU accounts .
Ex@@ pul@@ sions and depor@@ tations from Member States are often cruel , inhumane and unjust .
Poverty has increased and achievement of some millennium development goals is threatened .
I am grateful to the Commission for taking it seriously ; but I want to know as well what compensation will be available to ensure that those who have lost money are not prevented from trading altogether by the un@@ economic conditions now prevailing on this route .
When we elect a parliament we entr@@ u@@ st it with the safeguarding of our liberties for a temporary and conting@@ ent period .
And , also say to the Commission and to the people who are running your consumer protection cooperation : put this on your agenda .
Whilst accepting that good work is being carried out by the Daphne programme , the British Conservatives are opposed to the principles of the report , for the reasons outlined .
If you have good , targeted legislation which is fully harmonised in all Member States , this will have a tremendous impact in raising both consumer confidence and the level of consumer performance in all Member States .
Of course , the basis of the analysis is that health and safety issues are related to competitiveness and there is always a cost when we neglect social policies .
If there is evidence , it will be presented , and we rely upon you to take action where it is necessary .
Conti@@ nual enlargement will never be a sustainable answer to the question of how to live with Europe &amp; apos ; s neighbours .
Secondly , companies need more women at board level to ensure that the widest possible range of thinking , perspectives , experience and abilities is brought to bear on high @-@ level level decision @-@ making making .
It was a step down the lad@@ der which is weakening democracy in that country .
author . - Mr President , I know Commissioner Kuneva is here , and I very much welcome the opportunity at this last session of Parliament &amp; apos ; s mandate - even at this very late hour - to have an exchange of views on the Commission &amp; apos ; s consumer rights proposal .
We , as the Commission , use every opportunity to encourage the authorities to continue their efforts and ensure that all crimes are duly prosecu@@ ted .
We can do our best , but what we need from the Greek authorities is a clear show of unity , and a clear show of resolve to tackle the difficult issues in that country .
Thank you very much , once again , for your support .
The problems have occurred at the national level .
Let us do it legisl@@ atively and with fiscal instruments .
We are keeping a close eye on what happens in Russia , in order to be able to use the positive forces that exist in Russia .
I know the same can be said for my predecessor , Pat Cox , who sends through me his warm@@ est regards to you on this day .
A strong Europe is not bureaucratic , but has a common approach to those issues .
As has been mentioned , a team of Commissioners will be going to Russia later this week in order to discuss a number of issues , including many areas of cooperation with Russia .
. Common fisheries policy rules must be implemented effectively and in a uniform way .
If you give us examples , we will look into them .
Furthermore , with an increase of just 1.@@ 0@@ 4 % of women &amp; apos ; s participation in the labour market , the additional costs of extending maternity leave would be covered .
Whilst many cases are dealt with by cooperation , the Ombudsman refers to the increase in critical comment that he is forced to make .
On Amendments Nos 2 , 3 , 6 , 10 and 12 , the Commission considers that the content of these amendments is already covered by the common position .
I am drawn to speak before my co @-@ rapporteur rapporteur merely by reason of being first in the al@@ p@@ hab@@ et and not of sen@@ i@@ ority in this Parliament .
Amendment No 1 which I moved in the committee and which was carried , would indeed make certain that there could be a single committee responsible for the labelling of products for alcoholic beverages .
Certainly there is a very strong commitment in the House to the subjects under discussion by those who have remained here .
If the Commission does not indicate its willingness to follow Parliament &amp; apos ; s wish expressed in its Resolution of 31 March - namely to replace the present &amp; apos ; light &amp; apos ; agreement and adequacy finding with a more substantive international agreement - Parliament will vote to seek an opinion from the European Court of Justice on the legality of the agreement currently before the House .
Mr President , you know as well as I do that this is nonsense .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I just want to pick up on what Av@@ ri@@ l Doyle spoke about when she said we have a plethora of initiatives and labels which are ethical and sustainability labels , to say that I think the Commission needs to look at this to make sure that people are not being mis@@ led .
That is important because all the things we have discussed this morning show that we are able to move Europe forward .
Mr President , climate change is a challenge to us all .
The amendments the Commission is willing to accept are as follows : Nos 2 and 3 in principle , part of No 4 and Amendments Nos 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 , 13 , 14 and 17 .
If the substance of the compromise is not honoured , we would rather this unnecessary directive did not reach the statute book .
in writing . - At a time of serious economic and social crisis , we need to increase efforts to coordinate macro @-@ economic economic and structural reform strategies across national borders so as to tackle the imbalances that hinder the generation of jobs .
We therefore consider it necessary that the directive does not contradict this principle .
I understand that they are the ones that have to tell passengers what their rights are , but in various instances , with Air France in particular , we are told that it is not up to the airline operator .
In consequence , I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B@@ . These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permit@@ ting greater development of practical and visible projects , particularly those of an infrastructural kind .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I believe that we all agree on the importance of sport and that it can be very enjo@@ y@@ able for all of us .
For the internal market package , I believe that now , after the vote , it is very necessary for all three institutions to move ahead rapidly to w@@ rap this thing up and go on to the implementation stage .
This is one area where the European Union can have a practical effect on citizens &amp; apos ; lives by improving living standards and increasing environment opportunities .
In some cases they are right ; the more sizeable airports in the EU , like London He@@ a@@ throw and Paris Charles de G@@ aul@@ le , should be regulated so they are not in a position to abuse their market dominance .
That is why we took a pragmatic solution , promp@@ ting Member States to complete their election procedures as quickly as possible , provided , obviously , that all the parliamentarians who are going to join us are going to be directly elected .
Governments must remember the message from the debate on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty , which is that the general public , acting through the ballot box , are the ultimate decision @-@ makers makers on the pace and extent of European integration in all policy areas , including monetary policy .
An approach that es@@ che@@ ws absolute harmonisation , for example with a rate band with an upper and lower limit , would be a more realistic option both in terms of chances of progress in the Council , and also in terms of allowing a degree of tax competition between Member States .
However , there is clearly a role for the EU , to assist Member States &amp; apos ; agencies in sharing models of best practice and ensuring a level of consistency throughout the European Union .
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 19 , 21 to 24 , 26 and 29 to 44 .
What concerns me if there is a developing crisis that may have an effect on other countries , is that there should be some mechanism for crisis management between these organizations and including defence organizations like NATO and WEU .
It should not be forgotten that our approach to climate change policy has helped put European industry at the forefront when it comes to environmental low @-@ carbon carbon technology .
I conclude by saying that it is worth remar@@ king that the three presidents , that is Mr Barroso , Mr Bush and Mrs Merkel , will be holding a formal brief@@ ing session with the Trans@@ Atlantic Business Dialogue and global corporate CE@@ Os but have not yet scheduled any such meeting with either US or EU legislators .
Should we go for the system we have in the Commission , where we are trying to create a conducive environment and managerial incentives for those DGs which can actually fulfil the goals established for women ?
Par@@ allel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imagin@@ ary problems we are having in this respect .
One of the issues which the honourable Member raises is the question of the Essen strategy which included , incidentally , a report on local initiatives and the contribution they can make .
At the moment we are talking very much about the H@@ 5 vaccine , but we have to be ready with other forms of vaccine should the disease mu@@ tate into another strain .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Madam President , the Commission is concerned about privacy and security problems in the information society , in particular when these put consumers at risk .
It is important that these are global minimum standards , because unfortunately the tendency has been for a race to the bottom in this area , as indeed in other areas too , so having this convention approved as soon as possible would certainly be something that I would urge at a very early stage .
If it is adopted , the Commission will , of course , ensure that all its conditions and rules are fully respected .
There are concerns , however , as rightly mentioned by other colleagues , with regard to our external borders and what we can do and how we can deal with them , about the issue of solidarity and about showing solidarity with other Member States .
We are also making progress in other areas because we have to look at the real economy .
All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation , and it is these laws which should be utilised fully rather than to create yet more EU legislation , which would have resulted in negative consequences .
I recognise and feel deeply the concern expressed by colleagues in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark .
Why not let the Commissioner responsible chair the Council in its form@@ ations for economic policy and interior affairs ?
Of these , about 15 % , or EUR 90 billion , are managed from Europe .
in writing . - The formation of a joint European identity and the growth in interest in the European Union and its gen@@ esis are challenges with which the European institutions are faced in their bid to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity .
This scheme for the sale of Community ships , which must be at least five years old , to be ref@@ lag@@ ged as Lat@@ vian vessels , should contribute to the achievement of that balance , provided that there is careful monitoring to ensure that such boats are not subsequently re@@ integrated into the Community fleets and also that quotas are observed .
I am sure this House will support the European Union and the United Nations in whatever way is necessary to achieve lasting piece and reconciliation on this tragic but beautiful remote island .
You are pretending it is not happening and you are actually destroying your own European Union because the whole thing falls further into public contempt .
The honourable Member asks that the Commission adopts the necessary measures with relation to the freedom of movement and so far as compensation is concerned .
In accordance with the institutional rules for their participation , the Members can attend plenary meetings , and the Commission will regularly provide information on those negotiations which are not open to observers on a regular basis to all Members of the European Parliament present at COP6 .
Turning now to the sensitive subject of VAT fraud , I would like to recall that at the ECOFIN meeting of 4 December 2007 the Council invited the Commission to accelerate its work on the conventional measures to combat VAT fraud .
The reality is that Europe should be a Europe that welcomes the ten accession states and that we should fully meet all our obligations to the ten states .
I believe that nation states should have their own foreign policies , and am perfectly happy for them to work together in cooperation when that is in their interests - be this with states in the European Union or with states outside it .
I want to pay great tribute to the Portuguese Presidency and my colleague sitting here in the Chamber who worked very closely with me , who supported Parliament in order to try to achieve a position which both the Council and the Commission could support .
I cannot go that far in relation to data on asylum applicants , but I can accept some of the amendments that have been put forward .
In my opinion , sovereign Member States should be free to set their own criteria and levels of taxation , and not have the EU dictate to them .
If that is so , it says a lot about the way the Union is squ@@ aring up for the challenge of enlargement .
I would like the Commission to give us more details as to what is going to be funded by the development fund and how it is going to be managed .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - As the Honourable Member pointed out , Regulation ( EC ) No 13@@ 71 / 2007 on rail passenger rights , Regulation ( EC ) No 261 / 2004 on air passenger rights - and let me also add Regulation ( EC ) No 1@@ 10@@ 7 / 2006 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air - recognise certain minimum , common rights for citizens when they travel by rail or by air .
We managed to convince the Commission and the vast majority of the Council to adopt 95 % of our amendments and improvements of the text , only a blocking minority of , at the time , 4 of the 15 Member States did not want to go along with that majority .
Therefore I oppose the position taken by Mr Evans and others that this Parliament should tell Member States what procedure they should use to ratify and we will be seeking to amend that paragraph accordingly .
It will be open to Parliament to amend the legal principles if it so wishes .
We as a Parliament want to see rights of children included within the Intergovernmental Conference and as part of the European Treaty .
But I cannot hide this fact : the Union &amp; apos ; s powers of persuasion in seeking to achieve this goal are obviously somewhat limited by the remaining difficulties of some Member States in signing and ratifying the Convention .
How do we ensure that we have access to all the relevant information ?
I applaud Mrs Peijs &amp; apos ; work in reconci@@ ling what looked fairly ir@@ reconci@@ l@@ able and coming up with a solution that favours home State control which is preferable in terms of the internal market , but I have some anxiety that there will still have to be some fine @-@ tuning tuning .
You might , I suppose , call the original parliamentary assembly a &amp; apos ; dimension &amp; apos ; , but not this parliament .
Apart from the Council meeting in June , could you indicate the rest of the timetable for coming to an agreement on the so @-@ called called &amp; apos ; fair share &amp; apos ; from the EU in financing third @-@ country country mitigation and adaptation ?
It is worth recalling that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , apart from being a significant agreement , especially in economic and trade relations , is also the g@@ ate@@ way , the w@@ ay@@ station towards candidate status in the European Union .
D@@ esi@@ gn@@ ing a reform package for European political parties as a means of mobilising the democratic energies of individual and organised citizens is not an easy task , not least due to the EU &amp; apos ; s systemic complexity .
To ensure the success of this work , it is absolutely vital that the British , German , Polish , French and Italian Governments and the whole of the EU administration lend their support to this great work .
Madam President , we finally reached a decision before the holidays ; this was not easy , and the decision was quite some way from the first Commission proposal .
We believe that all this must constitute a comprehensive response which will allow us , finally , to move out of reactive mode and to plan for long @-@ term term measures and a long @-@ term term strengthening of the European economy .
However it is done it must be a concrete expression of our belief that public services have an important role to play in a dynamic , wealth @-@ creating creating European economy that creates jobs and facilitates the efficient operation of the economy but also underpins social justice and creates solidarity .
Nevertheless as rapporteur , I took a decision to re @-@ table table all amendments which had been adopted and shall touch on five areas which are fundamental to Parliament &amp; apos ; s position .
Mr President , I should like to make the point I was going to make earlier .
It is quite intolerable that this House should be mes@@ sed around by Commissioners who are unable to come here to respond to debates , particularly when , as we have already heard , the agenda has been changed to suit their convenience .
As you might imagine , I want to talk about public service broadcasting because it is very much a part of the infrastructure of citizenship .
He is the Commissioner who was conducting those talks , he is here today and he is refusing to answer the question .
I am actively looking at whether we can provide additional funding in all of these areas .
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the tough@@ est issues .
The European Union is a system based on law .
It is true that difficulties arise in the field of trade , but it is also true that our difficulties can hopefully be solved more frequently through dialogue .
Of course , I shall inform you , as soon as possible , about the conclusions which the legal service of the Commission will formulate having studied precisely the reply of the European Patent Office to the letter which I sent it recently
The remaining 28 amendments can be accepted in full , including Amendment No 75 , the so @-@ called called &amp; apos ; compromise amendment &amp; apos ; .
We ask the Commission to assume its responsibilities and we ask the Council , which is not here , to meet the expectations of the European citizens when it comes to nuclear safety in Europe .
We share the concern expressed in the Commission &amp; apos ; s progress report about corruption in a number of these countries and the need for progress in implementing EU legislation , particularly in the field of justice and home affairs .
I am delighted that the honourable Member is with us ; it gives me an opportunity to answer a question about which I am concerned .
- That is clearly rejected .
However , it is not only a question of having communication in Europe : we need communication .
The Commission started preparations for the renewal of this regulation in Spring 1999 .
Mr President , this Parliament has a very good record as a strong supporter of the peace process in Northern Ireland and , indeed , we were strong back@@ ers of the peace fund for Northern Ireland .
That policy , I should tell you , is equivalent in effect to the stance of Austria , Finland and Sweden , and also Ireland , though the occasion of Lord Robert@@ son &amp; apos ; s intervention was Ireland &amp; apos ; s accession to the Partnership for Peace Programme .
What we must do here in the European Union is to support the legacy of the Orange R@@ evolution and our common shared democratic values with Ukraine .
It is important that we safeguard cooperatives and their par@@ ity of status , particularly at a time of increased competition and threats of globalisation , when there is a considerable threat of undermining the cooperative eth@@ os and its way of operating .
Administrative and institutional ti@@ din@@ ess must not impede our primary objective of achieving real change on the ground .
Concerning the issue of politici@@ sation of anti @-@ dumping dumping and counter@@ v@@ ail@@ ing measures , I think , actually , that we will see the opposite , because you know what the system is today : that a simple majority of the Member States &amp; apos ; representatives can block a Commission proposal .
As a result of this , the Petitions Committee , in the González Álvarez report , said that the procedure to amend the Ombudsman &amp; apos ; s statute should be seen in the light of Article 195 of the European Communities Treaty .
Here I very much agree with what Mrs Thor@@ ning @-@ Schmidt Schmidt has already said : it is not a matter of employment or a matter of Council meetings , it is a matter of real cooperation between the Member States .
. Mr President , the Commission is well aware of the concerns raised by honourable Members in relation to the Slovak police force .
I think we have managed to achieve an agreement which will free up circulation of safe products on the internal market , while introducing a tougher regime to detect dangerous goods and prevent them from coming onto the market and obviously maintaining tough rules , which we already have in place for food safety , medical equipment and blood products .
I am sure the Vice @-@ Presidents Presidents of this Parliament - many were here - will be happy to support your action in the Bureau .
The global financial crisis has revealed the deep structural weaknesses of the European development model , based on high taxes , high fiscal re@@ distribution , inflexible labour markets and unnecessarily extended welfare provisions .
We should treat Russia as an equal partner and an important neighbour but we must not be dominated simply by the strength that one partner has over another in certain areas .
Our aim therefore is to get the following things done : agreement on a new economic direction ; new priorities for European work in areas like research and development , energy , universities , migration , demography and so on ; and a future financing deal that is fair , begins to address those priorities and gives the future prospect of being able substantially to re@@ order the European budget .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , last evening we had an extremely fruitful discussion in this House on the appointment process for the chairs and executive directors of the new supervisory agencies .
By opening accession negotiations with Turkey , we are taking out a strong option on the pursuit of the political , economic and social transformation of that country .
The European Parliament will , I am sure , continue to monitor this situation to assess what effects are being felt by other countries , and to do all in its power to ensure that appropriate compensation is forthcoming as necessary .
This is about accountability to the citizen , because it concerns very important decisions .
The opposition from the right to the report means that aid to victims , making the support of terrorist activity a criminal offence in all Member States and encouraging the need for political dialogue , will not form part of a coherent European anti @-@ terrorism terrorism strategy .
This is an area that we need to look at and be very careful about .
Only together , in a more effective way , can the European Union tackle the challenges of the globalised world .
Secondly , it benefits farmers directly , unlike many parts of the present CAP , and thirdly , the sugar protocol itself helps some of the poorest countries in the world . It is very important that we continue to support those countries .
There has been a fruitful dialogue on the proposed regulation with Parliament &amp; quot ; s rapporteur , Mr S@@ z@@ ent @-@ I@@ v@@ án@@ yi I@@ v@@ án@@ yi .
The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee held a very important hearing where we heard from both deal@@ ers and consumer representatives about their very real concerns that the safeguards which have been put in place to ensure competition in the sales market , which were put there clearly in 2002 - many of them , I have to say , in response to concerns raised by this Parliament - have simply been swept away by what seems to us to be rather excessive ze@@ al on your part to simplify issues and make life rather easier for you , as an administration , to deal with it .
We prof@@ ited from participating strongly in the process and the citizens we represent will profit from its solemn proclamation especially as Article 5@@ 2.@@ 3 says the Union can then proceed to grant more extensive protection of European fundamental rights as European integration proceeds .
While I share the wish of the European Parliament to support economic growth through the EU programmes , we should also take into account the amount of payments that can be reasonably executed without undermining sound financial management .
Amendments Nos 10 , 11 and 15 are acceptable in principle .
I wish to make three other points .
This will surely bring more value and political weight to debates about sport in the European Union and also to developments surrounding cooperation .
When I undertook to do this report I tried to avoid the old arguments and to approach the subject from a different perspective .
Just before the weekend , the European Council agreed on a strong package of measures to reinforce the anti @-@ terrorism terrorism efforts of the European Union .
Based on this report and our consultation with other stakeholders , next week , on 3 May , I intend to present to the College of Commissioners a Green Paper on financial services policy for the next five years .
These lists have not yet been drawn up , which has resulted in a large number of petitions to the European Parliament , and citizens are concerned about the future of their children .
But what can we do about this ?
It is to his merit that the outcome , following conciliation , is so well @-@ balanced balanced .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Mr President , on 26 May , the Commission recommended that the Council should authorise negotiations on the EU @-@ US US data protection agreement and submitted draft negotiation guidelines .
In order to improve the perception that the citizens have of the Union , the implementation of an effective , strong information strategy is crucial .
The other area which gives us some cause for concern is the slow progress being made in the harmonisation of flight times and rest periods for air crews .
But taken across the whole United Kingdom , because others have dragged their feet , that may not be the overall outcome .
In addition , in order to improve the presentation and availability of information to the public , to specialised audi@@ ences and to patients , the Commission is at an advanced stage of preparing an EU public health por@@ tal , drawing together information at EU level , national and regional levels , and with resources from civil society .
Do you agree that Europol and the EU Anti @-@ T@@ error T@@ error Office are being adequately funded ?
We support the report &amp; apos ; s aim , in that we would like to see all countries of the EU offering support and social protection to self @-@ employed employed workers .
We also propose to elaborate a precise roadmap indicating short@@ - , medium- and long @-@ term term objectives with a specific timeframe for implementing them and obviously subject to the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s scrutiny .
We must win back the consumers &amp; apos ; confidence .
The Commission also counts on Members of the European Parliament to help in this communications effort in your national and regional contexts , and the Commission is open to any new ideas coming from your side .
It stresses the importance it attaches to the fact that each new constitution or constitutional reform should reinforce democracy and the rule of law .
So , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , are you willing to commit yourselves to obtaining an exclusive - and not a shared - mandate ?
Lastly , in this context , I regret the cuts in support for candidate countries , the IPA regional development and human resources instrument , which addresses areas such as unemployment , social exclusion and education investment - a cut of EUR 7 million , which is 0.@@ 5 % of the available operational credits that go to administration - without regard to the need of ensuring good local administration and without regard to the basic principles of good financial management which is so dear to this House .
First and foremost , we need to improve the procedure in respect of the pre@@ judicial issue laid down pursuant to Article 2@@ 34 of the EC Treaty .
To explain two of our Socialist amendments : firstly , I do respect his and your position about G@@ and@@ hi and non @-@ violence violence and I think it is a very important tradition that you draw our attention to in Parliament .
Mr President , Commissioner , I ask you to share the s@@ orrow as well as the anger I feel in speaking as a friend of Eritrea .
These comments are not just from employers , large and small , in farming , quar@@ rying , mining , engineering and construction businesses - to name but a few - who are rightly concerned about the very viability of their entire industries under these proposals .
This has to do with a new European Union facing its work .
The main aim of the measures we take at European Union level is to reinforce the Member States &amp; quot ; policies .
At the present juncture , financial stability is being safeguarded by the EU @-@ IMF IMF stability mechanisms and especially by the actions that the Member States - especially the vulnerable Member States - are themselves taking .
I would strongly urge Members of the European Parliament to support this science @-@ based based communication to the public , in order to reduce unnecessary fears and to reinforce our common efforts .
In short I presume it can be said that , in the negotiations , any applicant country will have to comply with existing criteria , and that any transitional arrangements will have to be limited .
It has been a pleasure to work together and I think the process of addressing a crucial reform of the Commission that is central to the future of the European Union has had added depth and richness because the four of us have been involved .
I would like in particular to thank Mrs Krehl for her work to bring some improvements to the Commission &amp; quot ; s original proposal , particularly in regard to partnership , the role of cities and their h@@ inter@@ lands , civil society , access for the disabled and the environment .
Terrorism has been a major problem in the Western world and in Europe it has been prevalent certainly since the Second World War .
Our duty as the Commission is to have controls and to see that Member States do their duty .
Today , citizens of a small country with a European perspective have a less favourable visa regime with the EU than a large country with no membership prospects - Russia .
From my experience , projects cannot achieve their goals if resources do not come in time and if they are less than the amount initially planned .
The Commission has , therefore , asked Parliament and Council in Article 3 ( 2 ) whether this should be taken into account .
That is why I will recommend to the Socialist Group that we support the amendment by Baroness Ludford which re@@ introduces the notion that this refers specifically to cross @-@ border border disputes .
That is how we answer when European law is at stake .
The action plan will guide us in delivering an ambitious set of very concrete measures in a field where the added value of Europe will be very visible to our citizens .
Finally , on the issue of regulation and harmonisation , in spite of amendments and some nice rhetoric to the contrary , there is a risk that we will see a level@@ ling down - rather than a level@@ ling up - of hard @-@ won won environmental health and consumer standards .
These nets are used by small inshore vessels to catch sh@@ ell@@ fish and lesser spot@@ ted dog@@ fish off the North @-@ West West coast .
I would suggest to Mr Prodi that many econom@@ ists believe that the most important factors for competitiveness in industry would be , first of all , a reduction in corporate and employment taxes and secondly , a reduction in the enormous and indeed intolerable burden of regulation which puts Europe at a great disadvantage in relation to other parts of the world .
Looking further ahead , the Commission is considering whether all different agricultural products should be lab@@ elled to show the place of farming and specifically whether EU farming requirements have been followed .
Mr President , we might ask what we should do to alleviate the political impasse and suffering of the people in these countries , but it pre@@ supposes three pro@@ positions .
So how are we going to evaluate the wider effects of our own macroeconomic policy ?
Thank you for your reply , Commissioner , which I believe .
In the medium term , while condemning terrorist acts we must bring Hizbollah and Hamas in from the co@@ ld and engage them in a dialogue for the establishment of a democratic framework .
Madam President , I would like to add my thanks to Mr Cunha and congratulate him on a very excellent report .
So far only two Member States have transposed the European directive and only six other notifications of initiatives to transpose have been examined by the European Commission .
Most stakeholders consulted and submitting their views share the Commission &amp; apos ; s opinion that T@@ D@@ Is remain essential in a glob@@ alising world economy where multilater@@ ally @-@ agreed agreed competition rules are lacking .
Let me now come back to the strategic objectives and give you a few examples of other key initiatives .
That is not so .
These problems should be addressed primarily by the European Union , through an appropriate common policy which requires clear legal bases .
I think it is very good that people are engaging in this campaign , and that it will strengthen the Irish links with the European Union - which is to be welcomed .
Yet even in developed countries we are seeing serious water shortages .
Yet now it is proposed that we be &amp; quot ; given &amp; quot ; our rights by European judges .
That would be very useful because they listen to us in Europe - they want to be a part of Europe .
I have one major concern and that concerns my own country .
We have a Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , and obviously women are lesser than everyone else and therefore , bizar@@ rely in this place , we need a separate committee .
Third , a number of us consider that the additional costs involved do not warrant extension of some of the measures to aquaculture , though I would add this is not my own view .
The presidency is maintaining close contact with the leaders of the principal Arab States to ensure that momentum in the peace process is not lost .
I fully support the condemnation of Iran in the resolution for its brutal human rights track record , including the execution of minors for sexual ch@@ as@@ ti@@ ty offences .
This is what really matters .
Madam President , I was very pleased to hear about the Commission initiative to establish a European Day against the De@@ ath Pen@@ al@@ ty on 10 October , and I fully support that initiative and urge all colleagues to support it , as many in this debate have done already .
The Commission also considers it appropriate to weigh the outcome of initial work on the overall issue before considering any more specific elements .
The Commission very much welcomes the decision to rectify that omission and looks forward to the debates that will take place on the strategy document which is going to come forward shortly .
I would like to think that when a report comes from the Commission the Council will address that issue .
in writing . - Although the situation in Syria , Bahrain and Yemen is something that ought to be addressed urgently , I would like to draw your attention to the alarming situation in Lebanon , where seven citizens of the EU from Estonia are held cap@@ tive .
Mr President , firstly I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur Mrs Fraga Estévez and the Committee on Fisheries and to Mrs R@@ ies and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety for a constructive report on a Community approach to eco @-@ labelling labelling for fisheries products .
But I put it to the Commissioner that there are many detailed checks en@@ gra@@ ined in the Regulation , quite rightly - things like the f@@ it@@ ness for transport of the animals , transport practices , means of transport , sea containers , integral journey times , res@@ ting periods , space allowances - which are all matters that cannot be viewed by satellite .
In this context I expressed my concern that the lack of a solution to the main issue could have a negative effect on the country &amp; apos ; s accession process .
Our citizens across Europe must see that the European Union is transparent , democratic and open .
