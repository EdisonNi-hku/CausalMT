That is peanuts ; it is almost a show of contempt for the crisis that the producers are going through .
European citizens no longer tolerate them and many , often wrongly , also blame the European Union .
We thought , before all or some of the heads of delegation , that it would probably be best , for Parliament &apos; s image , to get the text withdrawn and to vote next time ; the crisis , may I point out , will not be over by the month of June .
It makes provision for obligatory modulation of tolls to be paid as of 2010 by vehicles which pollute up to 100 % more than environmentally friendly vehicles .
As for the parliamentary dimension - to which I shall return in my conclusion , Commissioner - let me simply remind you of the commitment you made on the transmission of the strategy papers to the ACP countries , of course , and to the European Parliament .
In future , therefore , as a result of this reform announced in the Treaty of Amsterdam , nation states will no longer be able to control their influxes of immigrants and their immigration policies .
The rules of competition must be balanced by common rules and tasks concerning security , public services and industrial policy .
All sanctions against a country must be accompanied by visible , and therefore political , but also concrete support for human rights defenders in the country .
That means that these practitioners would form a jury and therefore be both the judge and defendant .
The Commission has presented a proposal to the World Trade Organisation asking for a ban on all subsidies in order to prevent overfishing , on the pretext of maintaining the sustainability of the fishing industry .
Indeed , when people talk about rebalancing flexibility and security , we know full well that this means more flexibility and less security .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , your speech , Mr President-in in-Office Office , has left me quite stunned .
The debt of those Member States that are on the verge of bankruptcy ? Social precarity , crushing taxation and the new type of poverty of Europe &quot; s Fourth World ?
We now know , and we have already discussed this on several occasions , that a number of obstacles to the creation of such an area exist , mainly with regard to the recognition of qualifications .
Mr President , dark clouds are gathering over the Atlantic and they are storm clouds .
They are also the victims of Clinton &apos; s folly in supporting the KLA , which , we should not forget , is a Communist and terrorist organisation like the Kurdish PKK .
I shall leave the final word to a European leader who , 20 years ago , found the appropriate words to speak about 8 May 1945 , and in a country where it was most difficult to speak them openly .
With this in mind , Mr Barroso , we are also counting on your personal commitment and on your leadership .
When that time comes , our fellow citizens , who for 50 years have been used to seeing a supposedly united Europe being built , will turn round and ask us : &quot; what have you done ? &quot; &apos; .
Yet the situation is urgent .
It truly is a beautiful text , technically , well-researched researched , with figures , graphs and tables .
For my part , I have a very specific question .
Let me specify , nonetheless , that the Berlin Financial Perspective made provision to set aside some EUR 39.5 billion for the candidate countries likely to join before 2006 , to enable them to be integrated into the current cohesion policy . After 2006 , however , they will of course be entitled , like the current Member States , to participate in a policy which will probably be rather different .
We in the European Commission have always supported this Treaty , and we had reason to think that , by taking the time to listen to the concerns of our Irish friends , together we would be able to find the elements for a solution .
They have also called for action to curb any escalation of tension in the country , which could lead to civil war , which would be a human , social and economic disaster for CÃ´te d &apos; Ivoire , which must , of course , be prevented at all costs .
In spite of their tentativeness , the report &apos; s suggestions are sound : it calls for a better assessment of the effects of enlargement and considers the 0.45 % of Community GDP devoted to cohesion policy to be a minimum .
The US army also has 200 military advisers in Georgia , with Putin &apos; s agreement .
Innovative solutions do exist in some countries - for example , Malawi - where , by proceeding on the basis of decentralisation so as to get closer to the people and by also arranging for an active role to be played by the patients themselves - those whose condition has been stabilised - extremely positive results are achieved . This even applies in extremely poverty-stricken stricken countries .
Commissioner , congratulations for introducing these stress tests , but you should step in to show your disagreement with the position taken by certain Member States , including the United Kingdom and France . This would provide a clear statement that this cannot be a national issue , but must be a European issue , the aim being to ensure the safety of European citizens .
President-in in-Office Office of the Council . - Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as several of you pointed out , no compromise is perfect .
Good spectrum management can significantly contribute to the Lisbon goals of competitiveness and economic growth and satisfy a wide range of the social , cultural and economic needs of European citizens .
Anything that provides additional information on the causes of accidents in Europe will in any case be welcomed by the Commission , which has set itself the task of proposing any measures that will help to halve the number of people killed on the road .
Tomorrow will tell .
Madam President , it is true , as I have already mentioned , that the proposal is not as ambitious as the Commission would have liked , a point which the rapporteur underlined quite clearly in her speech .
Rather , additional financing for new infrastructure investments should be used to improve energy efficiency .
I am now being told that positions have moved very close together on both on the tasks and on the structure of the centre , and I think that is a highly important factor .
You immediately made reference to the flag hanging opposite us and behind you , Mr President , and it is true that this flag unites us in spite of our differences .
Well , today , public deficits in Europe are siphoning off 40 % or 50 % or perhaps even more of domestic saving , which would be better used to finance productive investment and job creation rather than debts inherited from previous generations .
The Council and the Commission therefore need to make a greater effort to ensure that the Turkish Government observes the Copenhagen criteria , in other words , that it promotes human rights and the rule of law .
All our consumers want to know what they are eating , and they want to be sure that they can trust us .
The Commission is prepared to do so , and your Commissioner will endeavour to play a mediating role .
Yes , we are faced with a paradigm shift which boils down to two questions : what should be changed , and , secondly , what can we start by changing in regard to energy production ?
Consequently , we do not see how it could provide a clear vision seeking a balance between the free movement of services and the rights of workers .
I am not happy about a number of things it says , however .
What will the consequences of this be on the Member States &apos; policies ?
However , the medium-term term proposals , the central link between the two , are , paradoxically , completely inadequate , in terms of the funds devoted to research into the new generation of fission reactors that will have to replace those currently in service .
When I visit Sydney for the Olympic Games , I shall endeavour , together with Mrs Buffet , to meet with sports ministers from the other continents with a view to widening the range of our action and establishing bonds of solidarity among political leaders at a global level .
We are also giving ourselves the means to develop less harmful varieties .
Furthermore , although my liberal philosophy does not sit well with interventionism on market prices , I am above all opposed to the laissez-faire faire , lax approach and to cartels being formed in a given economic sector .
We wish to initiate this debate , and to fuel and feed it on the basis of these proposals , as I undertook , in order to facilitate to some extent , the difficult negotiations within the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is obvious too that the immigration proposals and another European &apos; blue card &apos; will have no effect except to deprive developing countries of the skilled workers they need most for their development .
From an institutional point of view , we will see that we make a statement to the Council and have it noted in the Minutes .
I therefore propose that we replace the term &apos; referendum &apos; with &apos; plebiscite &apos; , to bring this into line with the Georgian Constitution .
In the past , the facts have unfortunately often shown that this alliance is more frequently evoked than realised .
Europe needs to be well positioned in this global market .
As we take stock , five years after the European employment strategy was implemented , and before the 2003 guidelines on employment are finally adopted , it is important to reiterate that unemployment is still a scourge , and that it is the main cause of social exclusion .
We want to discuss the future WTO negotiations with the Americans , but has the impact of the Uruguay Round been felt ?
( The President declared the common position approved )
Why set up another fund when we have instruments such as the WFP , the FAO and others ?
Moreover , I think that this report will be enthusiastically adopted , because it aims to draw attention to the rights of those who are not generally very well defended , notably foreigners .
I am sorry .
We believe that the Commission is not so fragile that it is in danger of being shattered by a political crisis .
Before handing over to the Council , may I bring to your attention ladies and gentlemen the fact that there are three Members of this House born on 5 August - that is to say , the birthday of Neil Armstrong .
. Mr President , Commissioner , if we had to choose the subjects of our debates today , in relation to breaches of human rights , we would perhaps have chosen Tunisia , where human rights defenders were besieged yesterday by the Tunisian army .
You are personally well acquainted with these issues .
The accident that occurred at Seveso gave us the Seveso I directive . This was insufficient .
Without this understanding they will end up punishing us , there is no doubt about this .
The mechanism proposed is based on a number of new elements that the Commission was only able to set down after the adoption of this Regulation .
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses .
in writing . - Against the backdrop of the globalisation of finance , agriculture , migration and the market , the nations of Europe must form an alliance of civilisation with the countries of Central America .
Systematic and rigorous monitoring of the compatibility of European legislation with the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be guaranteed .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , I should first like to express my appreciation for the work done by the different rapporteurs and , in particular , by Mr Mulder for the general budget and Mr Guidoni for the agencies .
Yet at the same time , we ourselves must not stray into secondary details .
What it does is chip away a little bit more at the Member States &apos; prerogatives in the field of immigration policy , in other words , their sovereign right to select the foreigners who are permitted to enter their territory and to control the entry , residence and extent of the rights of those foreigners .
Any inequality based on a person &quot; s gender is a source of injustice , social violence and incomprehension among our fellow citizens .
It is their livelihood , their heritage and the future of their children .
We should , therefore , draw political conclusions and seek solutions at this level - we should monitor the activities of these services , subject them to legal and parliamentary scrutiny , adopt uniform rules to protect citizens at the highest national level and apply this throughout the European Union .
Mr President , the attitude of the Council towards the Middle East is characterised by extreme leniency . This is , without doubt , because of the unanimity of opinion .
They also augur extremely well for the European Union &apos; s future cooperation with that country .
We received this report , which had my support and that of the then Presidency of the Council .
The Council will obviously examine with interest the Commission &apos; s proposals concerning this Sewage Sludge Directive and particularly its provisions on bio-waste waste , which will , of course , be covered by this proposal .
I also recognise that web-based based health resources must be encouraged .
Those who dare to speak of the right to cultural differences demonstrate only their contempt both for women in general and for the peoples whose women are victims of this barbarity .
They involve producing and selling not products , like other industries , but cultural goods .
I was with Mr Tariq Aziz three weeks ago and he asked the following question : &apos; I am offering Europe the best oilfields in southern Iraq .
As from 1 February , the Commission will be proposing an amended draft interinstitutional agreement , which will serve as the basis for our negotiations .
In this area we support the Commission &quot; s position .
Mr President , I am one of those who , within the Convention , were , along with you , the first to campaign for the future Constitution to be submitted for ratification by the people , and , if possible , on the same day .
Mr President , for the first time in ten years , we shall actually be voting for the President of the European Parliament without any of those prior agreements between social-democratic democratic and socialist groups which always seemed to represent , to my mind , a kind of condominium , stifling democratic debate .
This is a fact and is not disputed .
Madam President , I am raising a preliminary question to this debate , in accordance with Rule 128 of our Rules of Procedure .
I know the rapporteur intentionally avoided this aspect of things and I regret that .
We should make that clear to those who might say that if the European space sector does not measure up they will buy elsewhere .
Therefore we will proceed to the vote .
Furthermore , I believe that the very structure of our text , as you yourself have stressed , Mr Moscovici , is an original one .
This report also raises the question of banning animal testing .
Methods for monitoring respect of BSE legislation have been strengthened .
A return of the political dimension is called for , not only in connection with this economic partnership , but also where the OECD , the WTO and the IMF are concerned .
This common position incorporates 33 of the 46 amendments put forward at first reading .
There will also be a need to ensure that the Agency grows in stature so that it has the power to act in every country .
Parliament also particularly wants all meetings between MEPs and interest groups on a particular issue to be mentioned at the end of the reports .
In Florence , young people declared themselves in favour of a fraternal , inclusive Europe that is open to the world .
( The oral amendments were accepted )
Accordingly , growth throughout the euro zone is a matter of common interest and I do not feel that the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form is the instrument that we need .
Finally , with regard to sustainable development , I am quite surprised by , let us call it , the superficiality of the proposition .
These are the lessons from the crisis , which is not over , and we are going to learn from all these lessons .
But if this future is shared , then obviously they are together .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to express - both in a personal capacity and I hope , given what we witnessed , on behalf of my entire group - the strongest possible condemnation of the disgraceful , chauvinist , anti-European European demonstration that was staged here earlier today .
Catalonia is a deeply Europhile nation , and yet today that nation has some difficulty in finding its place in this institution .
Thirdly , there is the issue of parliamentary control , which was mentioned in the previous debate , at both national and European level and also by means of a consultative parliamentary assembly within the WTO .
It will carry other technologically advanced equipment such as the passive hydrogen MASER atomic clock , which will be the most precise atomic clock ever launched into space .
Unfortunately , the Monterrey conference did not tackle this issue in any depth , nor that of introducing a tax on financial transactions .
We will not vote in favour of it .
It shows us that liberation does not mean dismissing everybody else &quot; s opinion ; rather , it means accepting diversity and democracy .
In France , where the epidemic is more recent and where systematic screening over the last eighteen months seemed to initially increase the number of cases , there has been a slight decrease since the end of 2000 .
It would be totally unacceptable if we were to allow the export of our most dangerous waste to countries outside the EU , where we cannot be certain of the level of safety with regard to the treatment and storage of the waste in the long term .
Given the confidential and sensitive nature of this information , however , the hearing was held in camera .
&apos; Protection of the Communities &apos; financial interests &apos; groups together the fight against fraud and irregularities .
You must choose : either you want to oppose the Commission or you want to work with it .
If Europe is not able to create a single airspace , how will it be able to build a strong political union ?
Competition would increase between car manufacturers and not between dealers or between dealers and manufacturers .
Do you not think that is the real issue ?
To ensure that Member States are not unjustly penalised , I move that the vote on this report be deferred until the Commission has delivered its reasoned opinion on action to be taken following the Council of State decree .
Finally , are you willing to relaunch the debate so that we can get an independent assessment ?
The assessment covers all means of transport .
Let us vote for it as it stands and we will all be happy .
A Lebanese Arabic writer even spoke about an Arab malaise .
In general , the Council would like to see the implementation of effective and credible intervention in the region , based on an analysis of needs , adaptation of levels and types of aid to the nature of those needs , and distribution of effort between all the bilateral and multilateral donors .
We know that , to combat discrimination , practical action is needed to reach out to people and help change discriminatory attitudes and behaviour on the ground .
It can take comfort in this choice from the recent European survey , which has shown that 79 % of traders surveyed consider that the legislation that has been adopted will have little impact on their foreign sales .
For the first time in the history of our Parliament , a motion of censure against the European Commission has obtained a number of votes which is close to a simple majority , and these votes come from all the political groups and all the Member States represented in the House .
Is this silence because the summit concerns an intergovernmental initiative and is therefore ideologically unsound ?
I think , therefore , that we can discuss working arrangements and the way the programme will be applied to see how we can deal with this objection .
It is a matter of urgency that we take action against this sickening situation .
Consequently , this report forms part of the work towards the objective of creating an internal market for financial services .
Although I can understand the difficulties facing the political leadership in Chad -the build-up up of arms among certain sectors of the community following thirty years of war , the looting , the assaults - I certainly cannot accept a situation where the guilty parties , or alleged guilty parties , are subjected to violence and conspiracy unworthy of a country in which - I am happy to say - the democratic process is under way .
It is the first report that I have presented within the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Gender Equality , of which I am an active member .
We have only voted in favour of these reports because there is no reason to prevent Denmark from concluding the agreements that it wants to conclude , and there are few opportunities to do otherwise in the current circumstances .
Decentralisation also has some very positive repercussions for MEPs and for Parliament .
In 1997 , the price of responsibility is the one demanded of us , if we want to offer the countries of central and eastern Europe the legitimate right to take part in the construction of a new political and economic order , one of peace , justice and security in Europe .
The Charlie McCreevys of this world are already preparing us for the next speculative bubble , which I predict will form around the secondary market of the emissions quota trading system .
The European Union needs to devise a strategy on the rights of the child , through practical measures to combat abuse , sexual exploitation and child pornography and to promote safe use of the Internet and eradicate child labour and child poverty .
The United Nations , its agencies and the World Bank are mobilising to strengthen international therapeutic solidarity .
My thanks go to the House for allowing us to make progress in securing our borders while maintaining the necessary flexibility .
Think of the euro , the Schengen Agreement , the Charter of Fundamental Rights and many other areas .
Secondly , tourism , for which the Union is the world &apos; s number one destination , became an actual competence with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , but it has no budget heading of its own .
It is in this spirit that we proposed this resolution , in the hope that the Parliament will shortly adopt it .
We can also expect increased pressure on the working conditions of railway personnel , as is happening in the case of low-cost cost airlines in the aviation sector , and fierce competition for the most profitable slots , without this having any effect on the final number of passengers transported .
In this context , I would like to answer a specific question put to me by Mr Daul - whom I would like to congratulate as chairman of the Committee of 33 , together with all the rapporteurs who have made a broad consensus on your resolution possible .
Giving Europe an identity through an anthem , a flag and a motto gives the citizens living and working in Europe an opportunity to see themselves as part of a single entity united in diversity .
This would be the &apos; least worst &quot; solution .
I believe that there are already quite a number of reasons in favour of that : to prevent , for example , starvation in the world , for it is scandalous what is happening in the 21st century ; to help Europe achieve the Millennium Goals ; and to fight for more solidarity in Europe .
The best way for the European Union to force the Turkish Government to meet its commitments , a method which is lacking in hypocrisy and which does not allow a pretext for further liberal pressure , which only in any case serve the interests of free trade in Europe , would be to support the democratic opposition .
You accept the United States &quot; chemical - and not wine-making making - practices .
I last night put an oral question to the Commission on this subject .
Any other solution would inevitably lead to an inactive and ineffective Union .
Secondly , there is cause to mobilise the working population , indeed the entire population .
As has so rightly been said by the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , the public authorities , be they regional , national or European , are not the best place to decide on the skills and qualifications required by businesses .
I should just like to use three words .
I therefore invite my friends to vote against my report .
The rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has demonstrated absolute scorn for the Committee on Petitions by not even seeing fit to put its conclusions to the vote .
Why this bellicose language ?
It must take account of the concerns of the ACP countries , which traditionally export their produce to the European Union .
I personally have been to Lampedusa and Malta ; I met the two ministers in Brussels when the first incident occurred .
I have no idea .
The year 2007 will have to be a decisive one where the guidelines on energy policy are concerned .
That does not mean that we should draw any hasty conclusions .
Do not forget the riots in France , in which young people shouted their hatred of our institutions , our values and everything that we stand for .
Mr President , the European Parliament has a crucial role to play throughout this process and I would ask you to be active and vigilant .
The Commission Green Paper on the security of energy supply recommends that substitute fuels should represent 20 % of our total consumption by 2020 .
As a member of the delegation to the EU-Latvia Latvia Joint Parliamentary Committee , I should also like to briefly mention this specific case , by way of example .
There are technical solutions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to see you again and I would like to start by expressing my agreement with what Mrs Bowles just said , namely that consumers need security .
As far as T2S is concerned , we have put into place a governance model for the development phase which seeks to involve all stakeholders through the creation of an Advisory Group on T2S where market players are well represented .
The rapporteur , however , has also succeeded in introducing amendments which I consider to be crucial .
Thus , since 2001 calls for proposals have attached great importance to the durability of projects during the evaluation process .
On the extent of the Russian withdrawal and the stability of the Caucasus , I would also like to say that we must not behave as though nothing happened , either .
Indeed , the notion of special services is eliminated by the amendments of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and by taking account of the opinions of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia had already been the subject of a positive assessment ; the dialogue was therefore concluded with that country .
The developing countries in question , which are our main concern , have indicated that they would be willing to look at the amendment to Article 31 that we have proposed .
One solution could be to keep programming as a responsibility of the Commissioner for Development , in agreement with the High Representative .
We are not afraid of transparency at intergroup level , which is why we are urging you to make an assessment , quite openly , of the intergroups during this term of office .
I therefore feel that , when passing judgment , we must take account of each country &apos; s history right from its beginnings , rather than simply noting the situation at the specific time when we make these judgments .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to restrict my comments to the report by Mr Bruno Trentin . First of all , I would like to thank him unreservedly for the excellent contribution that the European Parliament will make , through this report , to the broad economic policy guidelines .
I am not going to go into this problem . I do not want to dwell on the fact that Kiev was the capital of Russia and that the Crimea provides access to the seven seas .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I therefore invite this House to follow the suggestion made by the committee that I have the honour to chair , a suggestion that was also unanimously supported by the Committee on Development .
It stresses the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the regulations and demands adapted to risks and local requirements , but also the importance of a common framework guaranteeing European farmers equal treatment .
I merely consider that this debate on cohesion policy and this report testify to the fact that cohesion policy has been effective and useful , in accordance with the goals of the Treaty .
Our principles of freedom and democracy will cross frontiers all the better when conditions conducive to dialogue are restored .
In a way , governments get the coups d &apos; Ã©tat they deserve , and a weak democracy is vulnerable to military coups d &apos; Ã©tat .
However , I reject the internationalist justification used in the document , especially as I recall the total defeat suffered by the Lisbon Strategy .
The medium-term term objective must be very ambitious : to provide job security and training for all men and women throughout the whole of the enlarged Europe , to consolidate public services that are worthy of the name , to achieve genuinely sustainable development in all 25 Member States , and as a result combat social and fiscal dumping .
My third comment is that the Commission &apos; s text also raises the question of the costs of the operation , which are enormous .
For once , a technical expert is about to address the House on the subject , in particular , of depleted uranium weapons .
Thank you for what you are doing .
Products start at a value of 1 in farms , rise to 6 in supermarkets , and sole starts at a value of 1 in Africa and rises to 14 in French shops , with the result that at 8 p.m. ... the supermarkets close and Europeans rummage through bins .
I am delighted that European Union funding of SMEs is to be increased and that the report refers to more reasonable deadlines for making the payments .
How determined will it be ?
We will continually monitor respect for human rights .
In his report , Mr Van Hecke , whose work I applaud , points out that a long-term term strategy is the only way to give real support to the development of our partner countries .
I consider it essential that , in the Mediterranean situation , in the Balkan situation , we take account of the external dimension of the justice and home affairs policy , because it has a direct effect on our Member States &quot; home affairs policies , and so I plead once more for a truly common policy on asylum and immigration .
At a deeper level still , terrorism is both favoured and encouraged by the deep disorder into which the world is plunging under the battering that the nations are suffering as a result of the sacrosanct dogma of capitalism that is trade liberalisation .
I think that , in addition to the many friendly pats on the back that I get from numerous fellow Members , even from the centre right , Mr Oostlander , these Members realise that this prohibitionist policy is a criminal policy that encourages crime ; they realise that we must adopt a very different approach .
We know that , today , the UK army can turn people away and we know that there are refugee camps in France .
To avoid repeating myself , I refer you to my earlier speeches .
So , how is that linked to our debate this evening ?
What is more , in order to save the banks , you invented &apos; stress tests &apos; .
The Commission must ensure that this project is a major European objective by encouraging the large car companies on our continent to cooperate with one another , with such cooperation extending from research and development to marketing .
I believe that , thanks to Mr Stockmann &quot; s mediation , these amendments finally convinced people that a compromise was possible and persuaded the Council to accept it without going any further .
Although it may be difficult to have the various sensitivities , histories and , sometimes , contradictions live side by side , enlargement must adhere to this concept of peace and take part in the creation of a community that transcends ancient geographical and ideological borders , guided by common values and rules .
You said that my speech did not match the deadline that was set for the end of this year , so that the Nice European Council can evaluate the policy on asylum and immigration .
It is a sign of responsibility and maturity to be able to turn a blind eye to divergences on whether to maintain or phase out nuclear energy and to come up with an effective policy for burying nuclear waste .
The EIB has not fulfilled the minimum conditions to assure us that its investments will be socially , environmentally and even ethically responsible .
I thought the European Commission was supposed to defend the financial interests of the European Union .
What I do note is the fact that this reduction in the public deficit is the largest ever recorded in Europe for fifteen years .
The situation of the stock exchanges today reminds me of the history of the euro , and I want to draw your attention here to something we all need to remember : without political intervention , that is if it had been left to market forces alone , the euro would not exist today , or else it would be quite different from what it now is : a currency that inspires confidence , that is shared by so many Member States and that so many Member States aspire to adopt .
The only talk is of how best to manage the demographic collapse and ageing in the Member States , with pension funds authorised in a passing nod to global finance .
Ordinary people expect no less of us : that is clear from the mass of correspondence we receive , calling for swift and strong action .
My dear Jo , if you will return to your seat .
Madam President , I would like to add my own congratulations to those addressed to our colleague Mrs Dagmar Roth-Behrendt Behrendt for all the energy and good will she has expended to get her report adopted .
Mr Walter &apos; s report falls foul of a substantial obstacle which he cannot overcome : the incompatibility of the single currency with economic and social cohesion .
We are now awaiting the assessment of this and we are quite disappointed , just like a number of stakeholders in the market who can clearly see that self-regulation regulation is not enough in this area .
In this perspective , it really is necessary to change the attitudes both of our citizens , who too often have a negative image of enterprise creation , and above all of the authorities who , for ideological reasons , balk at creating the conditions for a genuine &apos; entrepreneurial revolution &quot; by refusing to reduce the administrative burden and tax pressure upon companies .
The European Union &apos; s sanctions reflect our dissatisfaction with the slow rate of progress towards democracy , the persistent detention of numerous political prisoners and the violation of fundamental freedoms .
When the time comes , the Commission will have to report to the Council on any failure in this area .
In other words , for example , it took no less than three good long years to ratify the Europol Convention .
( The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment ) ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
At a time when this mechanism is still in its early days , let us now hope and pray that it will show how effective it is and secure the commitment of countries in addition to those that , on the model of France , are already involved .
Even though this rise in food commodity prices could conceivably boost our European farmers &apos; incomes , we must not forget that the livestock sector is seeing a corresponding hike in the price of animal feed .
Too often in Europe , nationality and citizenship are indissolubly linked .
Mr President , the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused , as has been said , 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion , i.e. EUR 11 billion .
Economic and Monetary Union needs stability .
Finally , as rapporteur Ceyhun points out , the budgets for Eurojust and the Drugs Monitoring Centre in Lisbon are increased in particular in order to enable those bodies to adapt to enlargement .
The scope of this text must be clearly specified .
Basically , we must make a personal investment in all these areas .
The extension of air passengers &quot; rights to include all types of flight is a welcome innovation . Thus passengers on scheduled flights , which represent only half of the market , and those on non-scheduled scheduled flights , particularly on package tours , will be able to assert their rights in the same way .
On the issue of volatility , this will be addressed in the common agricultural policy reform for 2013 . It is envisaged that this reform will include proposals for as yet non-existent existent mechanisms to address the issue of income volatility .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to highlight an initial point that I think is fundamental : the Commission declaration is a poor one .
We should remember the principle of association .
If we have not voted against this report , abstaining instead , it is only because , despite its limitations , it might lead to air transport passengers receiving a little more compensation in the event of overbooking , cancellation or long delays of flights .
I also want to work more closely with the European Investment Bank to look at innovative forms of financing .
You are right to highlight this aspect , and several of you have done so this evening .
I believe that the Balkans will not be reconstructed unless the European spirit of co-responsibility responsibility becomes the dominant spirit of politics there .
Moreover , Paragraph 25 of the report states that we need , &apos; a common asylum procedure within the EU based upon high standards of delivery &quot; .
Twenty-four four years after the horrendous accident in Chernobyl , I am pleased to have contributed towards security on our continent by voting in favour of this report .
I would add that , because the Council did not hold back the authorisations that had to be requested by the owners before having recourse to self-handling handling , the result will , as my fellow MEP Mr Savary said , be the introduction of the law of the jungle into the whole sector .
And that must not happen .
Thank you , once again , to Mr Vatanen .
It is , we feel , putting the cart before the horse .
No more impact assessments , no more prevarication , no more national egoism : for goodness &apos; sake act !
I also have a subsidiary question : will this approval be valid in all EU countries ?
To get straight to the heart of the matter there are three points that I would like to raise .
I believe that this difference between our Parliament and the other institutions does it great credit , and the recent positions adopted by the parliaments of Denmark and Luxembourg , by the Belgian Foreign Affairs Committee and by 200 members of the French Parliament , directly inspired by resolutions adopted by our Parliament relating to the invasion and occupation of Tibet by the People &apos; s Republic of China , are all eloquent proof of that .
Consequently I am pleased this evening , but I am vigilant .
Thus all is set in Europe and , as we say in my country , &apos; a word to the wise is enough &apos; - that is addressed to the Member States .
President-in in-Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , Commissioner , Madam Vice-President President , Mrs Morgantini , ladies and gentlemen , you have raised the subjects of Israel &apos; s imprisonment and administrative detention of Palestinians , including minors , and of their treatment in the occupied territories and in Israel .
This withdrawal has still not yet been completed .
Mr President , I am pleased that , in spite of everything - since there was some doubt whether there would be any at all - we are having a report and debate on these important matters .
The Members of Parliament must be covered by a specific decision which could perhaps envisage a separate supervisory board , for parliamentary inquiries , for example , which would be elected by this House at the beginning of each legislative term .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the House , at this stage , following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest , I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi .
Many associations of elected officials have already informed me that they are enthusiastic about this Erasmus scheme for local elected officials .
First of all , some of the people who attempt to enter Great Britain illegally are asylum seekers , but some are illegal immigrants , even in France .
But will the most vulnerable countries of the South , which only produce one thing and are net importers , benefit in any way from it ?
Corsica and French Hainaut will no longer be included among the regions assisted under Objective 1 .
That would not be reasonable , it would not be responsible and it would not be worthy of a self-respecting respecting statesman .
On the fourth , as I said in the reply to the first point of the question , the objectives of the regulation are openness and interoperability .
The Union was condemned because , at the time , it did not supply the necessary scientific evidence to justify such a ban .
Who could say no to using tax reductions as an incentive to consistently improving energy efficiency in our housing stock ?
Mr President , for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money .
Specifically , there are currently the stirrings of a movement aiming to speed up the transposal of directives into national legislation , employing rapid methods such as orders , as used recently by the French government .
This last point is essential . It may be remembered that union leader JosÃ© BovÃ© was convicted in France for having uprooted transgenic corn plants , an act considered to be a violation of a private property right .
We had imposed on us the wheat war , the meat war , the cereal substitute war , the banana war , the protein war , the food-weapons weapons war , the aerospace war ( with the Comet , the Franco-British British Concorde , MacDonnell Douglas and Boeing ) , the image war in the audio-visual visual field , the movies , the patents war , the commercial war of the Uruguay Round - all this to such an extent that Agenda 2000 is possibly a good thing , provided we can become adults at last , that is put an end to the infantile disease of the Atlanticism which struck down the Italian , French and Belgian political classes , an example of which is the recent speech by one of our colleagues from the radical party , adopting an Uncle Tom approach .
While denouncing the lax approach taken by some Member States , it certainly did not point out its own reluctance to drag France before the Court of Justice because it quite appropriately decided to maintain its embargo on British beef .
This can only come from strong European institutions and a determination to raise our level of ambition , to deliver change .
This peace consolidation committee would be a permanent body which could assist the Security Council and Ecosoc during the various phases of the conflict .
As for the political body mentioned in the FourÃ§ans report , while not simply call it an &apos; economic government &apos; and give it , as Article 103 of the Maastricht Treaty clearly calls us to do , clear powers to coordinate budgetary , fiscal and structural economic policies ?
That is what people cannot understand .
On 15 October , the whole of the European Council needs to formally provide an absolute guarantee for deposits throughout European Union territory .
Freedom of movement must be encouraged , while ensuring that career paths are safeguarded .
Even today , I cannot , through the amendments voted in the energy and research committee and through the hundreds of amendments registered here , in the plenary session , make out exactly what is the scientific orientation of the European Parliament - and that is a euphemism .
The European institutions may have the power to decide what constitutes a legal or illegal way to use the proceeds .
And what proposals did the European Commission come up with ?
And , if I may , I should like to make a few comments on the amendments that have been tabled .
Thanks to the subcommittee chaired by Mr Soulier , in Algeria &apos; s case , Parliament is moving in the right direction towards adopting a dignified position , so it will not contradict itself by adopting a paragraph which demands that an international committee of inquiry be set up on Algeria tomorrow .
Well , I think it is better to prepare for that coolly , calmly and intelligently , rather than go through it in time of crisis , with all the risks that involves for our economies .
When you talk , for example , about profile , I believe that it is still quite normal to be able to set one up .
But I would also like to take advantage of this explanation of vote to mention the parallel resolution combining a number of the undertakings made by the Prodi Commission in areas that were often technical , but important , relating to the Code of Conduct , ethics and transparency .
That is what we are proposing to ask of the Commission .
The December European Council will debate the Commission &apos; s proposals and the various national support plans that may have been put in place by then .
This adjustment has , of course , been approved in the report that I am presenting . Some amendments have also been tabled , which I would like to take you through briefly .
I like the sermonisers who say , with regard to the Russian army , what did you expect ?
Madam President , we have survived the cold snap here , in this Chamber .
It is undoubtedly one of the cultural industries that makes a positive contribution to the important issue of industrial competitiveness featured in the Lisbon Strategy .
The Member States have made progress in this matter and it should not be underestimated , even though the efforts made to achieve it seem to be inconsistent as a whole .
The voting session that we have just completed is yet another perfect illustration of the frequently hemiplegic behaviour of the European Parliament .
Did the Communist Party , to which Mr Wurtz belongs , not welcome Stalin &apos; s acquisition of the atomic bomb , at the time ?
By bringing these people together we can promote a dialogue between the public authorities , as the responsible authority , the experts , led naturally by the WHO , the medical profession , which must not be forgotten , the NGOs , industry and the trade unions .
At the same time , like many Members , I congratulate the EESC for setting up an audit committee made up of three EESC Members , whose tasks include the verification of the independence of the Internal Audit unit and the assessment of actions taken in response to the recommendations contained in the audit reports .
What public opinion sees is a few declarations condemning certain aspects of the war in Chechnya ; what we are actually seeing is political and financial support for the Kremlin .
I will grant Mrs GardiazÃ¡bal Rubial that the final agreement will perhaps not be founded on the simplicity that we would like and need , but we shall try in any case to ensure that it satisfies all of the institutions and that it provides the effectiveness , transparency and democratic character that the European Union sorely needs .
Ladies and gentlemen , the problem of tax havens is not a mere technical issue .
Having said that , issues that are just as vital for human health as those surrounding BSE would not stand up to most close examinations .
In view of this , it is quite easy to see how the interaction of one text with the other texts fully justifies this &apos; package &apos; approach and the need for agreement on all of them .
This matter , which I consider to be serious , Commissioner , should also be addressed through integrated policies associating social , and cultural and educational objectives , and should be discussed at policy level to increase awareness of this phenomenon .
Since the CFSP is quite able to prevent members of Parliament taking part in delegations to international conferences , since it is totally ineffective from a foreign and security policy standpoint , let us settle for the wording we have and await with interest the reply the Commission will give regarding this affair .
To conclude , as you can see , up to this point the European Union has not stinted its efforts to seek a rapprochement between the various points of view in the Middle East and it will continue along this track for as long as is necessary .
Instead , we champion a model of cooperation and solidarity between the Member States .
If the regions are to continue to cope with this period of economic restructuring , they need a proper budget .
The tobacco industry presents itself as the harbinger of employment in Europe and claims to defend jobs , but what has the management in the tobacco industry actually achieved between the late 1980s and the present ?
This directive is a good compromise between encouragement and constraint where environmentally responsible construction is concerned .
It has also been seen , even independently of any problem of terrorism , that simple natural disasters could have catastrophic consequences .
Varela Suanzes-Carpegna Carpegna reports ( A5-0194 0194 and A5-0188 0188 / 2000 )
As regards the first element , the crisis has highlighted the fact that it was absolutely crucial to strengthen comodality in European transport , since the cloud highlighted the limits not only of aviation systems at European level but , more especially , of rail travel , since countless travellers were unable to find an alternative .
The feasibility study has been carried out by a Franco-Canadian Canadian group .
Under these circumstances , the European Union and our Parliament must create the conditions to ensure that the Israeli Government abides by international law , using the suspension of Article 2 of the EU-Israel Israel association agreement as a sanction if necessary .
This is an initial experiment with a decentralised asylum-related related programme .
The next item is the Commission statement on the progress of SIS II and VIS .
This is why I am in favour of raising safety standards - the famous CE safety mark - so that we can reduce the risk of dangerous substances being present in products that come from China .
I recognise in them the familiar methods to which his party habitually resorts and which merely amount to a form of insult .
Then there is the environmental crisis , which is probably the worst .
I also want to express my complete support for the eventual provision of a standard basis of solutions that allows a tailor-made made set of measures to be drawn up for each territorial level .
We will eventually reach a situation where we are disregarding a fundamental principle of the Treaty , namely national competence in the area of criminal law .
Then , inventions appeared in which only the software was new , while the carriers and handlers were old .
This is not true , ladies and gentlemen !
Creating a security community means resolving the problematic issue of the conflicts in Transnistria , Nagorno-Karabakh Karabakh and Georgia , which are still threatening to flare up , as the events of 2008 demonstrated .
Three articles in the Charter are devoted to gender equality .
I call on the Member States to coordinate the formalities to be fulfilled for enrolling in the establishments of other Member States .
in writing . - I am pleased that the European Parliament approved the amendments to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Seychelles for the period 2005-2011 2011 .
It is , I think , the spirit that we should have with regard to monetary union , in the face of the nationalist demagogy and the gloom-mongering mongering of the extreme Left who rant and rave against monetary union .
The second important point relates to the problem of co-existence existence between GM cultures and non-GM GM cultures .
Finally , it stressed the importance , subject to the results of a feasibility study proposed by the Commission , of a computer-based based monitoring system as a long-term term objective .
My thoughts are also with the victims .
The French Socialist delegation has voted for Mrs Stauner &apos; s report postponing the granting of discharge for the financial year 1998 , because it resulted from a compromise by our political group with the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m , what are these legal measures ?
Turning to structural policies , the motion for a resolution adopted by the ECON Committee refers several times to economic divergences in the euro area .
With this resolution text , I wanted to urge the European Union to take a strong line on social dumping .
All of these Council decisions must be implemented firmly , but with discernment .
Include the single currency and the single budgetary policy in your revised Maastricht Treaty , and include a ceiling on compulsory deductions , like the Karlsruhe Court is in the process of doing for Germany .
On the eve of the country &quot; s parliamentary elections , the conservatives &quot; coup d &quot; Ã©tat is succeeding . Only fifteen of the reformist parliamentary candidates who were disqualified have been reinstated by the Revolutionary Council .
At any rate , this subject should at least be dealt with more objectively and seriously than has been the case today .
You have , for example , a group of banking experts .
My view is that it a failure for both Europe and for the Presidency , because the disagreement on the financial perspectives , which would have been a minor hiccup under normal circumstances , coming as it did amid the uncertainty stirred up by the French and Dutch referenda , plunged us into a profound crisis .
Because they had the feeling that Europe had become indifferent to the difficulties they faced in their lives .
That is why I am proposing to you that you amend the order of business along the lines I have just suggested .
This is why I am confident that , with an additional commitment - and I appeal to the European spirit , especially of those who failed to show it last time - it will be possible to have a 2011 budget and to lay the foundations for a truly serious discussion on the prospects for financing the European Union in the future .
Then , my group will emphasise what it considers to be positive advances : new parliamentary prerogatives , a willingness to encourage ordinary people to get involved , and certain elements of transparency .
There is considerable potential for opportunities of which they are currently being deprived .
As for the reform of the Structural Funds , Corsica and French Hainaut will see their regional aid cancelled , while fragile rural areas that enjoyed Objective 5b status will only receive the minimum share of a new inconsistent package .
We should therefore welcome the fact that on the eve of the elections , Parliament , like the Commission , has been able to tackle the demands of the economy and managed quite honourably to resist the pressures of public opinion , the media and other pressure groups .
As a majority of the right and Liberals rejected the 10 Socialist amendments , including those relating to better protection for minors , I voted &apos; no &apos; in the end along with most of my political group .
I am therefore delighted to see that women are now present in many fields that were still closed to them not so long ago .
It would be more honest , I believe , to acknowledge the genuine influence , on the development of generic products , of a genuine policy that works as an incentive in terms of price and refunds and , in parallel , of an effort by health professionals to enlighten their patients , and I support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten Ruijten &apos; s arguments on this point .
I am answering on behalf of the Council and not on behalf of the French Government .
It would be good if she could also sign the rather more modest payment orders for the taxi drivers who bring Members here to this House .
Who are these children and what is being done to locate them ?
As for the World Anti-Doping Doping Agency , WADA , it poses a few small problems , since among other things it is not based on international law and , therefore , neither are its proposals .
Contrary , too , to what some of its opponents have said , this text is addressed to all patients and is re-establishing establishing more justice and more fairness , since , up to now , only the wealthiest have had access to cross-border border care .
Unanimity is the certainty that no great or bold decisions will ever be made , that no risks will ever be taken , because with unanimity we have to fall into step with those who want the least from Europe .
The German leaders have again today latched on to this illusion to keep their citizens in the dark while definitive decisions are taken .
I voted in favour of the directive because there is definitely a need to return and recycle waste electrical and electronic equipment .
I should like to take the opportunity of the vote on this report on the voting rights of shareholders , which is unfortunately taking place without prior debate , to draw the Chamber &apos; s attention to the Eurotunnel scandal , the utter daylight robbery backed by French governments , be they socialist or liberal , that has been going on for years .
The European Union , which is ostensibly opposed to national state aid capable of distorting competition , is preparing , in the proposed report , to renege on its own proposals so as to be able to continue its policy of privatising public services .
Consequently , only 14 % of chemical substances produced in a quantity of more than one tonne are given a classification under the current system .
The question of a constitution and its contents is not asked , but instead the question of a charter of human rights which is obviously the precursor for a constitution , it being understood that the precursor will eventually give rise to a constitution proper and then , possible , to a State .
They , quite naturally , wish to be allowed to fish the stocks within their waters , but in that case it would be logical for the European Union to reduce its share of the catch , which it has so far refused to do .
It has finally awakened from its indifference ; it should learn a lesson from the failure of its monetary policy , since nothing would be worse than increasing rates again once economic growth returns .
The situation is only made worse by the news reaching us from Romania , where we are in a very difficult position as a result of the political uncertainty caused by the consequences of this crisis in particular .
Enterprises need equity , venture capital , guarantees , loans and the technical assistance proposed by JEREMIE .
Aung San Suu Kyi is the symbol of the Burmese opposition to the military dictatorship , and also received the Nobel prize in 1991 .
NGOs and health and environmental associations are stepping up their intervention against the situation .
Clearly , the level of noise pollution from night flights varies from one airport to another , according to the topography of the areas and population density .
Because history , and notably the experiences with the Stability and Growth Pact , has shown that it is only through the Community method that we can produce results which are democratically legitimised at European level , and which are binding and can be controlled .
What advice can parents responsible for the future of young people interested in agriculture give them ?
This is no longer open to discussion !
That said , there is another word I would suggest to you : harmonisation .
Citizens are involved because content relating to the arts , education , sport , tourism and so on , seems to me to be just as important .
I sincerely believe that a good service that Parliament could render to the people of Europe would be to promote the future institutional reform of the Union , in such a way that the forthcoming European elections could serve as a sort of referendum on this project .
Mr President , Madam President-in in-Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as Mr Marques and Mr Nogueira RomÃ¡n pointed out in their respective reports , the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds are of fundamental importance to the development of most EU regions , both in terms of infrastructures and from the point of view of social integration .
This measure supporting the food industry is becoming increasingly necessary , Madam President .
The answer is obviously no , in view of the large number of players involved .
In the case of men &apos; s violence against women the cause of the violence is machismo-inspired inspired and in the case of violence perpetrated by parents against their children the cause is an unthinking , even pathological , outburst .
This is so true that the accounting rules for the reimbursement of travel expenses are not based on the official nature of the building to which we travel , but on the political purpose which we are pursuing .
Following on from what many Members have said , I wish to emphasise the stabilising role of enlargement .
These are the rules .
The international community now has a comprehensive instrument with which to fight in a concerted way against the rise in organised crime .
The result is a Directive that ratifies a process for criminalising migrants , cramming them together under appalling conditions for prolonged periods on end and separating minors from their families , while the so-called called guarantees of the right to legal aid and appeal will in fact be left to the discretion of the Member States .
That is why the Charter needs to be an instrument that will enable us to regain the trust of small enterprises in Europe .
Wholesale automatic exchange , which forms the basis of the Alvarez and Dominici reports , is the scanner that strips you at every turn ; it is the SWIFT agreement on an even larger scale .
Madam President , I shall be very brief .
The request for defence of immunity , which was put together with your consent , Mr Gollnisch , is halfway between a call for help with no legal basis , given that this procedure does not in any way threaten to prevent you from carrying out your duties , and , as I see it , a baffling attempt to shirk your responsibilities , just as though you were at last overcome with panic at the thought of what you knowingly triggered off and clearly no longer control .
I also believe it is true that there is a need for a great deal of information in order to overcome the resistance of which you spoke and to resolve the real problems which that could pose .
The end does not justify the means .
The right of asylum cannot be used to protect criminals .
Turning more specifically to the fight against terrorism , we are proposing a substantial increase in the operational resources given to Eurojust , at the same time as increasing by nearly 30 % the appropriations allocated to the pilot project , which our Parliament wanted in order to coordinate more effectively the resources for anticipating and confronting the terrorist threat .
A new institution such as this falls at the stumbling block posed by the question &apos; why set up a new institution ? &apos;
As regards the Union , I would remind you that the European Council of 15 and 16 October stated its commitment , under all circumstances , to taking all necessary measures to maintain the stability of the financial system , support the major financial institutions , avoid bankruptcies and assure protection for savers &apos; deposits .
Lastly , I have great hopes that things will happen quickly at unilateral level , since the generalised system of preferences should be reformed quite soon .
That is the reason why we had a right to expect a text on 8 May 1945 from the European Parliament with a completely different focus .
That is why I have asked my services to undertake a new assessment of the entire architecture and role of credit rating agencies .
Secondly , the Commission had no other choice but to agree to negotiate a tariff reduction agreement with the countries competing with the banana-exporting exporting ACP countries .
Negotiators , if you want Cancun to be a success , then listen to the call from the Africa group and drop the Singapore issues .
I would say to you , Mr Medina Ortega , that I am with you on a major point which , in my view , must be a priority for Stockholm : I mean training for judges .
Products classified CMR1 , which are scientifically proven to harm human and animal health , should no longer be authorised .
I think we also need to realise that in this instance , presenting new programmes on a daily basis does not show real responsibility .
Moreover , the Commission should not have exclusive and discretionary powers : the national democracies should also be able to have an input .
My second comment relates to the fact that there is no regional approach on this .
We also need , in addition to economic conditions , new political conditions , which is why we placed an emphasis on cultural integration , education , cultural projects and on the rights of men and women .
Could I finally draw your attention to the meeting of the European-African African Ministerial Conference of 11 October ? It was a great success from the point of view that a political dialogue was entered into , whereby , needless to say , due consideration was given to the development of democracy and human rights .
Some possibilities have been retained , however , which I must admit I find somewhat shocking .
Undeniably , the composition of the Commission and the dubious solidarity between member states who have little respect for human rights often prevent us adopting clear-cut cut , distinct conclusions , or even any conclusion at all .
To be very honest - and many German and Austrian leaders pointed this out to us - rarely has the Commission reacted quite so quickly to current events .
As Mr Brok clearly said this morning , as I understood through the interpreter , we are practically going to establish a genuine State .
This summit would have been a triumph if the crucial revision of the Treaties had been crowned with as much success as the areas I have just mentioned .
In other debates , however , we have certainly always attacked the Americans for their underlying economic interests in this region .
The most important thing is to continue along this line , in this direction , and I am pleased that Parliament , I think I am now able to say this , will be supporting the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee virtually unanimously .
Have we really finished with all our contradictions ?
I would like to stress that cooperation between the Commission &apos; s delegations and Parliament &apos; s information offices in the Member States is working very well overall .
So what has become of our sacrosanct principle that the law shall be universal , indivisible and unique ?
The second example concerns the very controversial project of the opening of a gold mine at Rosia Montana , in Romania , a project that provides for the construction of a tailings pond for waste of highly toxic extraction , with a dam - brace yourselves - measuring 30 metres high .
But at the same time we must remain very clear about the conditions for them . It is impossible to hand over power of military decision ( even if we are initially told that only Petersberg tasks will be involved ) to very imperfectly democratic European institutions - and so they will remain , to human eyes , because there is no such thing as a European people .
We therefore gradually learn that the supranational Europol should take orders from a European public prosecutor &apos; s office , itself under the responsibility of the European Commission , which would be accountable in this respect only to the European Parliament .
I know that there have been some positive developments in this direction in the Southern African Development Community region .
I must therefore ask for your trust , because I have sought a balance .
That is why , to put it frankly , if the texts do not make significant changes on these crucial issues , I will be unable to support them in their current form .
The compromise states that it will be possible to withdraw certain ingredients from the list of allergens on the evidence of a scientifically-researched researched dossier , pending a full scientific study .
Therefore , in this report , the majority of MEPs support the idea that you should ensure an even greater degree of transparency with regard to loans that you grant to businesses and which pass through tax havens .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by expressing our sympathy for the Nepalese people , for whom the last few years have been one of the most difficult periods in their history .
With a view to responding to these concerns , the ministers responsible for gender equality policy in the 25 Member States undertook , in a declaration adopted on 4 February 2005 , to develop strategies to increase the number of women in employment and in quality jobs , to guarantee and protect the rights of women workers and to remove structural , legal and psychological barriers to gender equality at work .
In support of the new situation , we will continue to work towards a progressive reorientation of European construction and for transparency and democracy within the institutions .
The Commission is ready to lend its support to the reform process , including the provision of special assistance for the 2008 elections .
Entirely in favour of the implementation of a common European approach for early childhood learning - while respecting the diversity of each Member State &apos; s approach - I lend my support to Mrs Honeyball &apos; s report , which recommends establishing a European framework for ECEC services , highlighting common values and objectives .
I voted in favour of this text and am satisfied with the outcome of the vote because cyanide is an extremely toxic chemical that has potentially catastrophic and irreversible effects on the environment and human health .
In some regions , such as the Nord-Pas Pas-de de-Calais Calais , which already has 20 % unemployment , 3 500 jobs will be lost .
Elementary respect for life , protection of local economies , maintenance of a thriving social fabric in the rural environment , and the living and working conditions of country people have all been ignored in the definition of health policies in response to the foot-and and-mouth mouth epidemic .
Mr President , I am astonished at the Commissioner &quot; s response .
I would also thank the Commission for its efforts in trying to establish greater legal certainty for social services of general interest ( SSGIs ) , and particularly in respect of their specific characteristics .
He forgets that democracy in Taiwan , which is a Chinese country , is working better and better .
A slapdash enlargement would obviously be a great mistake .
I am abstaining out of consideration for the Danish workers of the Linak Group who have been sacrificed on the altar of globalisation .
I too was extremely shocked earlier today .
The third issue is that of God .
This text also allocates an equivalent amount to the areas affected by recent flooding in Portugal .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as has already been said , economic and financial crime significantly prejudice the financial interests of the European Union , to the tune of over EUR 1 billion each year , according to estimates .
I see the response of the Commission and the European Union in the area of cultural diversity as being structured around three main lines .
This is a decision taken by the immigrant himself , and if he is received into that State , it is not his place to claim the right to bring in other people .
And if our Swedish colleagues are happy with their policy , let them continue with it .
As yet , we have not had any reports of contaminated food containing levels that could present a health risk to our consumers and we will continue to apply the highest standards on this issue .
The situation in a number of our Member States is very serious , and for this reason we must put forward proposals that can address these issues .
Personally , I regret this and I believe that it will be severely judged .
Rather , we must defend the pay-as as-you you-go go system which is alone in guaranteeing the rights of employees and which allows the latter to claim a pension in a context of national solidarity between workers and pensioners , between generations and between the nation and its workers .
The second event is the future : our old industrial continent is in the process of changing and we must level out the territorial , economic and cultural inequalities .
Those are the most definite and most precise answers I can give you on the three points raised in your oral question .
Iraq was supposed to be weakened . It had been systematically starved for ten years , and forced to disarm in exchange for promises of peace .
It should not , however , lead to daylight robbery .
It is impossible to remain silent about this State crime , especially when it is committed by the most powerful nation on earth which too often attempts to impose its own order and values on the rest of the planet .
No one knows or wants to know because , if these terms were defined , this would weaken their real purpose which is to paralyse hearts and minds by constant repetition of the same generalisations and by the threat of demonising those not stepping into line .
Let me now mention the second guideline along which the Presidency hopes the enlargement process will develop in these six months .
Furthermore , this unified market would have relatively vague external limits , since it would have to respect the EU &apos; s commitment to a free world market .
Due mainly to the fact that it focuses on GMOs , when biotechnology is far broader in scope , this report , which is entitled &apos; Biotechnology : prospects and challenges for agriculture in Europe &apos; , has provoked numerous reactions , and not only within our group .
This floating , unchecked population is growing every year and adding to other sources of clandestine immigration .
Mr President , the main proposition of the Bourlanges report involves increasing the budget by EUR 700 million to finance what he calls the four priorities , with , first and foremost , aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo .
I believe that , because of our actions , the agricultural and agri-food food sectors are in a race towards low costs and towards the lowest prices on the supply side , and we are no longer shielded from deviations such as this type of unacceptable behaviour .
That shows how vital it is to improve awareness and to invest in prevention and in information about the use of condoms .
These stages will be marked out over time , with precise timelines , and will be discussed at the human rights sub-committees committees held with the country .
The financial contribution that is justifiably anticipated must be divided equally between all the Member States of the European Union .
To conclude , our relations with Turkmenistan must be shaped as much by our values as by our interests .
However , nothing should prevent the Commission , and nothing is preventing it , from pressing ahead with the preparations for the Treaty to come into force and for the instruments that will allow it to be applied as quickly as possible , as soon as the last country ratifies it .
We know , however , that illiteracy is still a major problem and that the main obstacle to social integration , as Mrs Hermange &apos; s report also emphasised , is this lack of basic knowledge .
I therefore support the desires which have been expressed to rationalize the objectives , to develop transnational mobility , to encourage recourse to new educational tools and to promote language learning .
That was the second stage of the road map , and it is what we are waiting for .
You talk of ACTA and say that we need to adopt it , but you say that we should not use the means that would be effective in enforcing it .
The Hungarian Government is a democratic government . If it were not , I do not believe it would be a Member of the European Union .
With this goal in mind , we must certainly welcome the Commission &apos; s initiative .
Behind this utopia , there is reality , a raw , pragmatic reality ; it is quite simply the desire of the large European parties to gain a stranglehold over the European Parliament , the desire of the Party of European Socialists and the European People &apos; s Party to appropriate democracy in Europe through territorialisation which , by raising the thresholds , will , in effect , give them a duopoly over European democracy , with the rather spiteful complicity of the Greens , who are hoping to close the gap between themselves and the leading parties in a European constituency .
I am , of course , aware that the Polish authorities are finding it particularly difficult to solve this problem for both financial and emotional reasons .
Madam President , honourable Members , my reply will be a relatively brief one , although a whole debate would be needed , of course , to deal with the question .
There was talk earlier of freezing the seas .
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France , Sweden , Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow .
In overall terms we had , as at 26 September , committed 17.6 % of the Cohesion Fund appropriations .
It has been voluntary until now , and will become mandatory from now on within the Union .
I should like to share his enthusiasm but , amid this chorus of praise , I must voice my scepticism .
What are the main concerns highlighted by this report ?
I wonder why , in an area such as social housing , we would not theoretically be precisely in the area of State aid .
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment , nothing to protect employees , nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still !
Finally , the Stability Pact will need to be amended , and the necessary balance found between strictness and flexibility to ensure that stability is not compromised .
I am sorry , really sorry that a report like this should reach plenary .
Do we want to open up our market to Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMOs ) or to beef from cattle raised on hormones ?
The first considered that investment firms - businesses practising internalisation - should be authorised to forge a strictly bilateral relationship with their clients , which had the disadvantage of not enabling these clients to benefit from the best possible price on the market , or even to learn what that best price was , or even quite simply to ensure price formation , which can only emerge from a general confrontation of bids and offers .
Europe , which has a tendency to forget such things , will rediscover this with some bitterness .
A resolution has been adopted thanks to the efforts by France and the United Kingdom .
As you know , Danone recently decided to close down several European factories , getting rid of thousands of workers , despite this very company telling us not long ago that its previous year &apos; s profits had been fairly significant .
Under these circumstances , the rapporteur proposes nothing less than re-specifying specifying the commitment made with regard to public debt .
We shall also be very attentive to enhancing Europe &apos; s position in the highly strategic biotechnology sector , while , of course , monitoring the observance of the ethical rules which must be applied to any scientific , inventive or industrial activity involving living organisms .
This is not the same situation at all and that was not part of the work of the Echelon Committee .
That is indeed what is proposed by the Constitution signed in Rome .
Officials who contributed to the inquiry are today being punished unjustly .
I thus wish to emphasise this aspect , for it seems to me we must avoid at all costs falling into the trap of viewing the social aspects as being contrary to competitiveness in Europe .
This systematic dismantling of the fundamental principles which define the specific nature of European wine-growing growing responds to a peculiar logic .
Firstly , the points of single contact .
To give you a quick idea of the great technical difficulty faced , I must tell you that it has been necessary to distribute more than 10 000 registration kits throughout Congolese territory , despite the fact that , in certain areas , there are no more tracks , there are no more roads , and that helicopters have had to be used .
As chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , I should like to add a word on the need for the public authorities to assist orphan drugs and a whole range of treatments which are vital to the third world - such as vaccines - but which are not profitable enough to allow laboratories to produce them or conduct the research prior to production .
Finally , and I have been fighting for this for more than twenty years , I see this House still preoccupied with the prevention of conflicts , a form of legal and moral interference which always has to be undertaken beforehand , and which must not cost much money , which must of course be efficient , much more efficient than the rest of the world , but always arrives too late .
I believe that a politician is someone who needs to anticipate problems .
Moreover , this is very clearly stated in Rule 161 ( 2 ) of our Rules of Procedure : &apos; If two or more mutually exclusive amendments have been tabled to the same part of a text , the amendment that departs furthest from the original text shall have priority and shall be put to the vote first &apos; .
Under pressure from certain lobbies , however , certain people wanted to ensure that this directive is applied with particular flexibility .
Regarding EUROJUST , I am surprised by the problems associated with failure to comply with the principle of segregation of powers for the tasks of the authorising officer and financial verifier , and that cooperation with the European Anti-Fraud Fraud Office ( OLAF ) is still so deficient .
I do not ? I will conclude then .
We shall apply the Treaty as it stands .
Apart from the Guinea-Bissau Bissau agreement , it is the only one that allows potential for cephalopod and crustacean fishing .
We can say today that the aim of this war will never be achieved by this war and the way in which it is being waged .
Double standards continue to dominate the external policy of the majority who govern the EU .
The main point at this stage is that henceforth the choice is available and that the debate on Parliament &apos; s involvement is launched .
If we have to allow the Ombudsman to monitor administrative problems , we must , for our part , learn how , before and after the fact , to control the insane Community machinery which is running amok .
Political dialogue is another essential element .
I welcome the Monitoring Centre &apos; s desire to carry out an evaluation of its operations in 2007 and the fact that a management plan is expected for 2008 and 2009 .
The Chairman of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , Mr Watson , apologised as he will be unable to attend .
The Constitutional Treaty will not be ratified without clearly established borders , enabling us to say which of the countries of Eurasia are not cut out to join the EU and which should be making active preparations for accession .
The second is that regulation implies , if we are serious , a convergence of joint preferences on matters such as the environment , health , workers &apos; rights , the place of public services and cultural diversity .
Until now , the scientific community could only issue divided , and sometimes contradictory , opinions , and public authorities have not really given attention to this problem .
We still need to give them the means to do so .
No , there are none .
In the wake of the recent unilateral attack perpetrated by the US air force and navy against Iraq , this action poses a new and grave threat to world peace .
The vote will take place on Wednesday , 12 December 2007 .
The caricatural example is of course my country &apos; s attitude to the Netherlands which , fundamentally - namely for having adopted practices protecting users of hard drugs from HIV infection - is a good example to at least listen to and to take on board .
The objective of the French Republic is simple and is very clearly stated in the Explanatory Statement .
Special investigation methods will have to be handled with a great deal of care .
I must protest . It is a matter of principle .
I should like , finally , to thank the Council , even though it is not present this evening .
Together with France , Great Britain and Italy , who are actively involved in training the Afghan army , Europe is playing an important part in this reconstruction work , whose second priority is to rebuild a fiscal and customs administration and dismantle the system of sharing state revenue between armed groups that had come into being with foreign invasion and civil war .
I would thank Parliament in anticipation of its letting us have all the information and observations available to it .
A cursory reading could lead one to believe that it is about protecting consumers by informing them of their rights and educating them about financial services ; in short , about enabling them to have a responsible and informed relationship with their bank .
We should ask why we are speeding up the liberalisation process when the 1991 directive has only just been revised .
I think that we certainly still have a lot of work to do in this field , but we have already taken a big step forward and I will tell you quite plainly that I am not one of those who will allow competition to become established outside a precise and effective regulatory framework regarding safety .
Personally I think that we need a floating threshold .
Following the creation of the Fund in 2002 , the European Community paid a total of EUR 522.5 million into it for the period from 2002 to 2006 .
As you know , free trade areas cannot be established overnight .
A purely repressive European response to the issue of immigration would certainly consolidate Europe &apos; s fortification mechanism , but this would be ignoring the most fundamental aspect , which is the uniting of efforts and sharing at global level .
Their national reform plans do not take account , at present , of the latest forecasts that you have put on the table .
Moreover , with the social market economy , Europe is presenting an idea for organising society that is very far removed from the &apos; every man for himself &apos; approach and from the excesses of a consumer society .
We need to move much more vigorously in the direction of legislation that encourages the replacement of growing quantities of fossil hydrocarbons in motor fuels .
Turning to the subject of customs representatives , emotions have been running fairly high in those countries which have had a long history of this profession .
Nevertheless , we are faced with the issue now and we must face up to it .
This is the reason why I cannot but approve the action of the rapporteur in deploring the lack of transparency in the ECB .
And we are going to show the world that , even in the occupied territories , we are capable of holding free elections &apos; .
An historic step has just been taken in the case of the handover of Hong Kong , in the conditions of a positive negotiated settlement of a difficult dispute . There is not a single word in this resolution to salute that smooth handover , alas so rare in the modern world .
We are in close cooperation and monitoring this very closely , and you can count on the Presidency to demonstrate understanding and tolerance , as you indicated .
This is a sector that is undergoing enormous change and is particularly interesting owing to the very significant technological advances it is making , and it remains a powerful medium of expression , inter alia of identity and citizenship .
We only know about the stock that has been sold , which is not far off 160 grams .
That is a criminal act .
On that point too , important proposals by the Commission are on the table , and a strategy for combating terrorism is in the process of being completed .
Only , seven years later , the same obstacles are still there .
To crown it all , it is actually dangling the idea of full employment , i.e. the creation of 20 to 30 million new jobs , before our noses .
We failed in Amsterdam , despite excellent work by the Dutch Presidency .
These are designed to regulate the way in which data is handled when it is collected by private parties in the public interest , and it is in that activity that the problem lies , I believe .
The agreement approved today in effect authorises Member States to charge road haulage companies for the cost of air and noise pollution , in addition to charges on the use of motorway infrastructure .
On the other hand , it would be very regrettable if we could not tidy up our regulation on this point when there have been so many problems in the past .
How far is Europe going to go ?
In contrast , the Council , which is made up of the representatives of the governments , does have a certain democratic legitimacy .
Madam President , Mrs Reding , Commissioner , I should like to thank all my fellow Members for their contributions and their speeches .
Yet this legitimate defence of dignity , equality and freedom is hypocritical !
The solution is of course more Europe , but not any kind .
It is Europe &apos; s duty to pass stringent legislation that will make these alchemists accountable and to guarantee product quality whilst also providing citizens with clear information .
It has to be said that in the twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz accident some things were perhaps achieved , but not enough to prevent this lack of maritime safety from being eradicated .
My final remark refers to a point I forgot to mention before , namely racism . I believe it was Mrs Roure who asked the relevant question .
on behalf of the PPE-DE DE Group . - Mr President , President of the Commission , President-in in-Office Office , ladies and gentlemen , the Lisbon European Council marks a return to a Europe of achievements and added value .
I think that this is the only way to fight against further bureaucracy , the only way to once again make our institutions meaningful , the only way to reinvigorate European integration .
If this measure were to be adopted , fishermen might well reject the whole of the inspection process .
How does the Commission plan to ensure that the appropriations made available by cancelling the debt are properly invested in eradicating poverty and in sustainable development ?
There is no magic bullet to turn around the European Union economy .
The current push for democracy in North Africa should be extended to Iran .
This is of vital importance , because here too this process helped us considerably at crucial moments , in defining the concept of e-Learning Learning immediately after the Lisbon Summit , and in formulating the e-Learning Learning action plan , immediately after the last European Council .
I deeply regret this delay and , like my fellow Members , I hope that you will be able to remedy it as soon as possible .
A better solution would be , as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism suggests , strengthened coordination between LEADER + and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes , such as INTERREG , PHARE , SAPARD or MEDA .
The financial perspective is nothing like what it was supposed to be .
What will the Union &quot; s regional policy , which represents almost 40 % of the Community budget , really be of use to : the Lisbon Strategy , territorial cohesion , or indeed both ?
In the light of the broad guidelines provided by the European Council , the Commission should now submit proposals for guidelines comprising the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines , and should combine them in a single coherent text .
I took note , Mrs Vassiliou , of the Commission &apos; s wish to speed things up .
We have gone beyond the stage of the declarations of intent which we heard throughout the last decade , now it is time for the words to be applied in practice .
It would be irresponsible because Europe would be sending out the message that it has not decided to make the efforts it promised on this front and , if Europe does not make these efforts , our chances of convincing the rest of the world of the need to preserve the global balance are non-existent existent .
I believe in any case that a specific budget attached to LIFE is a determining and essential factor for this House .
The first of these is the proactive aspect of the training of crews made up of nationals of Member States of the European Union , before we encourage and facilitate the recruitment of sailors who are nationals of third countries , which is what the present directive tends to do .
I do not fully understand your desire to see NGOs participate in the election campaign .
Tabling reforms at the Intergovernmental Conference , along the lines of what I proposed three weeks ago : excellent !
We will internalise the external transport costs of heavy vehicles because that is precisely how we will encourage the use of other modes of transport .
The French text reads : &apos; exhorte le Conseil Ã  ne mÃ©nager aucun effort pour crÃ©er les conditions propices Ã  une brÃ¨ve interruption des bombardements &apos; .
There are two approaches to addressing this problem : firstly , to encourage the use of more environmentally-friendly friendly means of transport , with the Union providing financial support for large structural projects , and secondly , to incorporate the environmental cost of transport into the price of goods or to tax transport in relation to its environmental impact .
It guarantees freedom of conscience and of worship .
Madam President , I am convinced that if all Members of the European Parliament had an opportunity to visit the Palestinian territories , if they could see and hear what our delegation has just seen and heard , there would be widespread agreement amongst us that Europe &apos; s current timid &quot; wait-and and-see see &apos; attitude needs to change at a political level with regard to the Middle East peace process .
It should also be recalled that Australia and Japan have announced ambitious goals - not yet in binding terms , certainly , but at a political level .
This issue is included in the debate on urgent issues .
Indeed , from a very young age , caring for children , their learning and gradual awareness of their environment are of decisive importance for the next phase of their education .
I hope that Commissioner Patten , in particular , will ensure that everything is done to deal with this tragedy as best we can .
The compromise also contains an entire section devoted to the promotion of democratic principles , electoral processes and parliamentary democracy .
Ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .
Are we to believe that Member States do not support their airlines , whether they are in public or private hands !
Wake up , Mr Lambrinidis . The official admission of 40 million immigrants from outside Europe is the opening of the floodgates .
It is also our priority to ensure that the privacy of people who provide biometric data is protected .
Without taxes , there is no State .
Many Members have supported the idea of a strategic stockpile of antivirals , and I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety should have accepted my proposal to implement a compulsory licensing system that should enable us to produce these antivirals more quickly and in far greater numbers so that at least 25 % to 30 % of the population is covered in each Member State .
Mr President , Mr Maat &apos; s report quite properly defends the right of millions of European children to receive subsidised milk in school .
But the way forward certainly does not lie in the centralisation of powers in the hands of the Commission .
Mr President , I would just like to point out to Commissioner Patten that we already have an association agreement with an Arab country . We have had one with Tunisia for two years now and things are going from bad to worse !
If all goes well , what are you afraid of ?
It is true that the Commission should take the initiative , but I would like to know how , as President-in in-Office Office of the Council , you are going to support this proposal by Parliament .
Today it is vital to set up a framework for Member States and strengthen supervision of the ways in which the Member States choose to store waste .
It is true that this will entail additional costs .
It is against this background that today &apos; s debate on parental responsibility is taking place .
As you know , in the days immediately after the attacks , Mr Chris Patten , accompanied by Mr Louis Michel , the Belgian Foreign Minister representing the Belgian Presidency of the EU Council , and Mr Solana , travelled to Pakistan , Iran , Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Syria .
Let me give you a piece of advice .
In this respect , the European Parliament had a duty to reaffirm its support for this policy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , I should first like to recall that three years ago , when the International Tribunal was set up , there were many Members of this Parliament who criticized this initiative or expressed scepticism about the first serious initiative by the international community regarding Yugoslavia .
Has the matter been referred to the Austrian Presidency of the Council ?
Following the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit , we have always stressed the need for a balance between quality and quantity .
Development assistance implemented by the United Nations must focus especially on achieving the Millennium Development Goals , with particular attention to the Least Developed Countries .
Finally , it has to be said that the Arab League has never had to deal with religious problems .
That is not always the case .
As you and we both know , this agreement makes provision for procedures which can be applied if human rights are not respected .
If Europe does not do its duty , if the Council of Ministers does not progress on this issue , there will , unfortunately , be other Semira Adamus .
I regret that , unlike other institutions , the Council does not publish an annual activity report , citing the Gentlemen &apos; s Agreement of 1970 .
For that purpose , we hold trump cards which others do not .
In the current situation , we should say to the Russians &quot; If you want money , if you want us to reduce your debts , you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia &quot; .
Mr President , I may be able to clarify things .
However , the fact remains that the truth does need to be established and that we do not feel that it is fair to apportion equal blame to the government and to Jonas Savimbi &apos; s uprising , for restarting a civil war for which UNITA bears the overwhelming responsibility , notably by seizing land and towns that in theory had been restored to government authority .
The European Union protects its citizens .
To complement this concept , my group proposes introducing the concepts of nutritional value and optimum health in Amendment No 8 .
The stability pact is a necessity .
Doubts were first instilled in December , during the Copenhagen Summit , where Europe proved itself incapable of speaking with one voice .
Mr Verheugen , all of our countries are now having to deal with poverty and social exclusion .
However , the countries must at least have the opportunity to do as they wish .
This issue , which concerns one of the jewels in the crown of industrial and technological Europe , on which hangs the future of 118 000 employees throughout the world , is a practical test of both the European project and the Commission .
I therefore appeal to all those who govern us , particularly to the French Government , which is currently guiding the work of the European Union , to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference to be held at Nice in December confers a share of responsibility for this matter upon the European Union and involves Parliament in the implementation of this initiative through the codecision procedure .
Last week at the Bundestag , Members of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments , from the East and West alike , shouldered their responsibility to history by encouraging recognition of this genocide .
The institutional mechanisms already no longer allow the Union to function satisfactorily .
Lastly , businesses can give practical training .
To conclude , I have a specific question to ask the Commission and the Council : when will we finally be able to make progress with other practical instruments , such as the exchange of evidence and information between criminal records bureaux ?
For this to happen , the Eritrean Government must not only release all political prisoners and journalists , but it must also lift the ban on all independent journalists .
Unfortunately , the talks failed , which resulted in the Indonesian president imposing martial law and launching a widespread military operation .
I fully believe that society must take on its full responsibilities in terms of training and education in both the short and long term .
The Commission will cooperate fully with the Presidency and Parliament to seek political agreement on directives between the Council and Parliament .
Therefore , in the social field , it was the United Kingdom , whose legislation is the most inadequate of all the large countries , who proposed the British exception .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I want to start a constructive debate on this question with the European Parliament , but also with the Member States and the parties concerned .
I have often expressed my pride in what I have achieved together with my colleagues , the Palestinian peacemakers , led by President Arafat , our wise and courageous leader , with faith in the cause of peace and its inevitable victory , despite the obstacles on the way and the faintness of the glimmer of hope .
I would add that unannounced visits to detention centres are aimed at preventing ill-treatment treatment , which generally goes unpunished in France , as indicated in the most recent report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture .
We are not asking it to deal with such problems , we are simply asking that it should analyse them .
It is true that even though that is about the metal industry and not specifically steel , it is a useful example : this very polluting company is going to shed thousands of jobs without taking any social or environmental responsibility .
I will rapidly pick up the four points that have been raised in the debate : the elections , the future of our cooperation , the intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo and finally the violence perpetrated in connection with agrarian reform .
Moreover , this directive will simplify admission procedures for employment purposes .
Instead of improving , trade terms between the European Union and the ACP countries have deteriorated .
In response to this last question , I would say straight away that the answer , for me , is &apos; no &apos; .
The procedure is undoubtedly long and in need of improvement , but I am pleased to see European solidarity being shown in this way , in the face of the tragedy the victims have experienced .
That it the situation up to and after Camp David .
We are also told that these arms were to be used to terrorise the civilian population .
Then deepening the Union , that is , the implementation of institutional measures giving strength and vigour to the policies proclaimed in Maastricht , but which had remained dead letters since .
No one wants this , no one has talked about it and no one intends to implement it .
I would appreciate it if those of my fellow Members who are going to the area at the beginning of December would assess the precise extent of the irreparable damage that would be caused by implementing such a project .
It is always very difficult to know whether pacifism or its alternative is the right course of action .
Secondly , another major debate in the Schengen context is that of the protection of privacy , which involves everything relating to personal data .
The introduction of a moratorium would , in fact , have been in agreement with the policy of prevention and the strengthening of security measures for oil platforms , and would have been in line with Barack Obama &apos; s policy of implementing a similar moratorium in the United States until December 2010 .
It will ease the burden of the conditions required in return for obtaining public funding and will broaden the options for making use of this funding .
Obviously , sending instructors or teachers to African countries costs relatively little but it nonetheless constitutes an extremely important contribution to those countries .
The industry is doing its utmost to play down the impact of pesticides .
You know that the future enlargements are of concern to a large number of Europeans .
I have been described in many different ways during my political life , but this is the first time that I have been called an ultra-liberal liberal .
The profound process of transformation that has been under way in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989 has had its impact on the rise of racism , xenophobia and antisemitism .
But perhaps the Stevens report has another , hidden , objective : to try to eliminate these recalcitrant countries that could in future become embarrassing witnesses to the error of the single currency by absorbing them into the euro zone .
I certainly share the fears that have just been expressed by the honourable member , and as I know how concerned M. Poos , our Minister of Foreign Affairs , is with regard to this dossier , I can guarantee that this aspect of things will certainly be raised at the meeting with the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs .
We all remember the contaminated blood tragedy and the dangers to human health posed by mad cow disease .
Unfortunately , we were pressed for time and I am the first to regret this .
We go on repeating that cohesion policy is essential to Europe &quot; s overall dynamism .
I am thinking in particular of the idea of a framework directive on minimum income . Despite this context , Belgium can be credited with some real progress thanks to the fighting spirit of your ministers and of our ministers : the report of the EPSCO Council before each European Council to act as a necessary counterweight to the ECOFIN Council ; the conclusions on social services of general interest ; pensions , notably the conference on pensions in LiÃ¨ge , which highlighted the necessary joint consideration of the adequacy and sustainability of pensions , which I feel bound to stress , and the EPSCO declaration on the Year for Combating Poverty .
Aside from their limited legal rights , they are both the judge and the ones being judged .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate Mr PomÃ©s Ruiz for producing such a clear report . It highlights the need to take account of the territorial dimension of cohesion policy , over and above the purely economic and social aspects .
If Mr Schnellhardt &apos; s machine had worked - he has told you that this is not the case - the amendment would have been rejected .
Maintaining them would be suicidal .
The majority within this Parliament is therefore taking advantage of the fact to return to its ideology , that of aggressive trade , based solely on the interests of gaining greater market access .
Mr President , today I must join with the authors of the joint resolution in standing against the failure to respect human rights in Vietnam .
Yet there are those who want to restrict us yet further and who would deem the report ambitious . That is why this House should adopt the report .
First of all , Mr Chairman , I note your agreement as to the reasons justifying making this mechanism more flexible so than it can be properly implemented within an enlarged Europe .
Then there is the amendment that introduces the reference to the law of the place of work in the case of mobility .
We are particularly in favour of the possibility for the foundations to act outside EU territory also .
Whilst I am in favour of the measures that have been suggested , I would nevertheless like to go further : indeed , these measures are still far from being adequate , especially since , with regard to the buy-back back quota , the ball is again back in the court of the Member States and national funding .
With regard to my own report , Parliament has got what it wanted on almost all the important points in it , firstly because ships will be inspected not only in ports but also at anchorages , as we called for .
However , why not talk about the presence of displaced persons on our territory who have the same morals as those who are fighting over in Algeria , and who are raping women and slitting people &apos; s throats ?
We are in a crisis , and it is high time we were given a legal basis .
This is one of the major pillars , one of the fundamental added values which the Commission can provide at the present time .
This compromise takes account of their fears .
in writing . - According to this report , &apos; the Fundamental Rights Agency could be a proper body providing a regular overview on the enforcement of human rights &apos; .
But if we want matters to progress smoothly , we must firstly foster real convergence , and in order to do that , we feel that the European Union must also contribute towards gradually upgrading the candidate countries &apos; production base .
Subsequently , it is important to help women suffering from the disease .
Not only is closer cooperation itself vigorously denounced , and rightly so , by the small- and medium-sized sized Member States , as damaging to their integrity , whereas sovereignty is a principle that guarantees the equality and respect of each .
But what we can do is enter into a solemn commitment to do everything we can to try to eradicate this sick phenomenon , and especially the exploitation of sexual perversions and sexual misery by criminal networks throughout the world , and in particular in the third world .
On 22 July , the Commission started court proceedings to ensure compliance with European Union legislation designed to improve air quality in Europe .
We will get on with our work .
Mr Lagendijk &apos; s report enjoys Socialist support , and we endorse the Ahtisaari Plan , which is an excellent basis , but it is not the European Union that will decide on Kosovo &apos; s final status ; that is a matter for which the Security Council is responsible .
There are no public services in Kosovo , and the Commission only needs to go there to see as much .
They have already explained the Lisbon Strategy to us on three occasions ; we are familiar with it .
Indeed , limiting to 250 kilometres the threshold for compensation in the event of a major problem means effectively excluding three countries of the European Union .
Finally , the Member States and the Commission should use all the means available to them to eliminate the stereotypes that contribute to discrimination against women in the workplace .
The Commission , which , by the way , is already doing a great deal of work in this area ( supporting the judiciary , helping victims ) , is prepared to continue to support the DRC .
In those surroundings , a microclimate developed , a kind of infectious euro-enthusiasm enthusiasm driven by the federalists ; it caused many members to lose sight of their national positions and interests and they had their revenge later .
We must also adopt international agreements which are not limited to establishing the responsibility of the owner of the vessel , as is the case today , but also extend responsibilities to all the actors in the transport chain , ship operators , charterers , and also owners of the cargo transported , thereby encouraging the latter to take care to choose safe ships .
Of course , my group &apos; s vote will depend on the outcome of the vote on the committee &apos; s amendments and also on the amendments that will be proposed tomorrow .
As the promotion of cultural diversity is included in the EC Treaty , it naturally forms part of our trade policy .
That is not enough , however .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to take this opportunity to express to you again my profound European convictions .
Neglecting pasture land and not maintaining undergrowth increase the risk of forest fires . These fires are causing more and more damage and are becoming more and more frequent , mainly in southern Europe .
The resolution also wants to impose , as a &apos; priority &apos; , respect for the &apos; world trade order &apos; , in other words , submission to the dictatorship of the WTO and neo-liberal liberal dogmas .
Even I have to say it .
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts .
Have their citizens been told about it ?
Nonetheless , the Commission has accepted the approach adopted in the Council common position , which consists of introducing differential treatment to reduce the risks arising from exposure to natural sources such as the sun or to artificial sources such as lasers or ultraviolet lamps .
In 1999 we had a budget - I say this to the ladies and gentlemen of the Council in particular , I am reminding you of this because it is a matter which affects us all - in 1999 , Commissioner , we had a budget of EUR 96 billion .
Thank you , Mr DecourriÃ¨re , for this good report .
Will things return to how they were before ?
This is not a French minister addressing you , even though I am a former French minister , and please believe that I will look very closely at what happens in that country - of which I am still a citizen - so that it functions properly , just as I shall do in all the other countries .
That initiative was very warmly welcomed by all those who had been awaiting it for the past 30 years - yes , 30 years .
The Community production sector , and particularly small family producers , are in a state of emergency .
In particular , we reject calls for a European constitution , at least if it entails the subordination of national constitutions .
Women account for 19 % of doctorates in computing , and the percentage of women setting up their own businesses is much lower .
I am stunned that nearly 320 Members voted against Amendment No 6 which proposed something that seems perfectly obvious , in other words , that the support we are giving to the Palestinian Authority and its institutions must be coupled with a firm condemnation of the violence inflicted by the same Authority and the implementation of effective measures that will put an end to the terrorist attacks .
It directly influences trade through supply , which it restricts .
In these circumstances , we need to bear in mind Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union , Articles 2 , 3 , 6 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , particularly with regard to legal guarantees , and also the provisions of the agreements between the United States and the European Union on legal cooperation in criminal matters and on extradition , and the bilateral agreements in that respect .
On the 10th March 1996 , at the aid group meeting in Paris with the bilateral and multilateral donors , the German delegation and the Commission delegation have put pressure on Bangladesh to respect human rights and speed up the peace process in the Chittagong hills , In response , the Bangladeshi delegation declared that the new government in office since July 1996 has decided to settle the matter by negotiations , involving tribal chiefs and also the Indian government .
This one subject would mean having to jointly consider three consequences which are logically linked . These are qualified majority voting in certain cases , the enshrinement of the Luxembourg compromise in all cases and increased flexibility in cooperation according to a differentiated scale .
We are undoubtedly struggling today to find a political programme for Europe .
The negative effects of this globalisation are equally obvious : in the southern hemisphere where resources are being over-exploited exploited , in India and China where people , land , forests , seas and rivers are affected and human rights are jeopardised .
No one can say who would be authorised to mobilise and deploy such an instrument , which has a very direct bearing on the security of the Member States , assuming a way could ever be found to pay for it .
Mr President , Commissioner , as all chocolate-lovers lovers know , proper chocolate is made from cocoa butter .
Moving on to the von Wogau report , I would point out that changes to exchange rates between the currencies of countries belonging to the same common market have always been a matter of common interest .
I must point out that in seeking to replace the Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations , the European Commission claimed , perhaps rather naively , to be trying to communitise an existing instrument , whereas it was actually making radical changes .
While I share , at least in fairly broad terms , the judgments you passed on President Mugabe , the important thing for me today is that the European Union and Africa should be able to hold this summit .
Depending on the result of this consultation , we will shortly present a draft regulation to implement this quota .
And if it is a matter of wanting to help companies , it turns out that the first possible aid - tax aid in the form of deductiblity of VAT on expenses generated by the changeover to the euro - has already been denied them .
You pointed out to me that other bodies are responsible for dealing with these questions : the Bureau , the Quaestors , the Committee on Budgetary Control .
In a sickening act of vandalism , human excrement was smeared and urine was poured over the shredded files and ransacked offices of the Palestinian Ministry of Culture in Ramallah .
According to the terms of Chapter I of Title 11 of the Treaty , in particular , I am thinking specifically of problems to do with working conditions and improving the working environment .
There must be a clear intention to abolish the present cohesion fund which , in any case , was designed to give the Eastern countries easier access to the single currency , a task which has now been completed .
In the interests of safety , we also need to ensure that every box of prescription medicine is traceable .
The vital reform of the structure and composition of the Commission should therefore confer on it a legitimacy other than that conferred on it today through the national appointment of its members .
We must not make the same mistake twice .
Well , both the European Parliament and , more importantly , the Commission , will have to commit to this new exercise , which takes us up to 2004 and for which a new method has been authorised , proving that the intergovernmental method alone has had its day .
I am rather sorry that the Commission has not stressed this matter a little more , even if it has mentioned it .
Secondly , from the economic point of view , innovation in the field of software is often accomplished by SMEs or by independent researchers , for whom patenting is not a suitable instrument because it is too expensive , too involved and will create a legal nightmare .
We therefore listened for two whole days last week in London to what members of the main trade unions , members of feminist movements , members of Parliament from the Labour Party and employees of British universities had to say .
We should therefore start the debate straightaway in order to calm them .
In spite of this warning , it would seem that the current version of the law adopted on 14 July last does not dispel the concerns expressed by the Commission beforehand .
The investment facility managed by the European Investment Bank has thereby funded several hotel projects in the ACP countries , while the PROINVEST programme provides the sector with non-financial financial support , such as the strengthening of capacities and the promotion of investments .
Let us be alert to the cries of alarm rising up from societies on the verge of despair .
The one year minimum period which would relieve the Commissioners of their obligations after leaving office , seems far too short .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . Thank you Mr Catania and Mrs Roure for all the very useful work that has been accomplished .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to pay tribute to the report by my colleague Reinhard Rack .
This is a sensitive matter on which the Member States and the European Commission have been seeking an agreement since the beginning of the nineties , as the Commissioner has just reminded us .
This project , together with Europeana , should work alongside the other systems that exist in the world .
First and foremost , I would not have done this .
As for the managers , they are shielded , because they are covered by the millions of euros of their gilded parachute .
However , other measures may provide significant results , such as strengthening the fight against pollution from ships or promoting sustainable fishing methods .
Indeed , we must not forget that in this murky area , significant gains necessarily entail substantial risks .
Everyone has to make an effort .
This matter is also the subject of discussion in the Transatlantic Business Dialogue to promote the emergence of a Global Type Standard GTS 2000 .
Freedom of expression and information necessarily implies pluralism of the media , especially the audio-visual visual media .
That should not prejudice their private or public status , but allow them to be run as non-profit profit-making making bodies and be accessible without discrimination to all users .
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis . Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work .
Assistance to European small and medium-sized sized companies is of decisive importance , to enable them to establish a presence on Internet and access electronic trading .
The agreement between the Congolese government and the Congolese rebel groups , including Mr Nkunda &apos; s CNDP , in January 2008 , known as the Goma process , has also broken down .
Do you think that it is you , the President of the Commission - you have been elected and confirmed President - who makes the Commission , who organises the Commission and who defines the commissioners &apos; remit , or is it the countries of the Union and the large countries that impose , or otherwise , a certain position on you ?
In the end , nothing .
It will allow the Commission to cooperate more closely with the ICAO for the purpose of exchanging information and mutual support in connection with audits and inspections .
We must establish conditions that will enable all women to participate in employment , including mothers of young children , older women and women with disabilities .
- It is disappointing and frustrating that the Statement of Assurance should once again be negative .
In my view , Mr Menrad &apos; s report , which is the result of work that was carried out in an open , cooperative spirit , involving the social actors concerned and members of the Commission , which organised a broad public hearing on this issue , recommends bridging these gaps with a precise definition of information and consultation , by reducing , as proposed , the thresholds of employees required to establish a works council , by requesting that specific premises for consultation are maintained during mergers , by requesting that decisions made and which flout procedures can be overturned , and by introducing sanctions , including financial , for companies at fault and finally , by taking into account the opinion of employees and providing evidence that the procedures of the directive have been observed , prior to giving authorisations to mergers .
The Balkan war should have been the last , and I think it is up to us to nip the conflict in the South Caucasus in the bud .
Well , I would simply like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we have not actually altered the substance of what the rapporteur had proposed . This is for the simple reason that the last line of Article 2 excludes states with less than 20 million inhabitants from the obligation to create constituencies .
There are two points where it is useful and necessary .
It is too bureaucratic ; there will always be technicians who are called technocrats .
Europe is traditions , a civilisation , but it is also the adaptation to new realities ; it is a certain idea of globalisation , of the reforms aimed at creating a fairer society .
It is this anarchy in the plundering that bothers the rapporteur .
And this gap itself arises from a lack of national control over the European institutions , a lack which is far from accidental but is an integral part of a system which has specifically adopted the objective of bypassing national sovereignty and is now , as it were , being hoist with its own petard .
So I have voted for his report with determination and a degree of enthusiasm .
Nevertheless , we have the right to say what we think and I would say that , as far as the French delegation is concerned including , in particular , myself , although in no way am I dependent on the French Government , it supports the position adopted by the President of the French Republic , namely to oppose , by all possible means , the launching of a military operation .
Nuclear energy is a special form of energy . It has military and strategic implications , is subject to serious constraints in terms of the environment and the security of facilities and populations and possesses a political , real and even &apos; emotional &apos; dimension .
The Union is still an area of regulatory and fiscal competition , where the very notion of social market economy is not accepted and will not be incorporated , in my view , in the future constitution , especially since there is still genuine aversion towards economic affairs .
I think you have explained that the problems I asked about were really just teething troubles .
The solution to our problems , as I said at the beginning of my speech , is to have more Europe , not less .
Discussions have begun in Geneva on the future status of these Georgian lands that are Ossetia and Abkhazia .
It has to be said that the message and practice stemming from Laeken are contradictory .
In the absence of other alternative solutions proposed by the Council , it was necessary to vote in favour of making the European stability mechanism permanent , in order to provide assistance to our Greek , Portuguese and Irish colleagues .
EUR 2 a day : over 2 billion men and women do not have as much as that to live on .
On the day that I leave this portfolio , to which I have devoted a great deal of energy , I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to present you with a breakdown of the progress that we have made together and to set out some guidelines for the future .
Progress has been made , however , particularly in the course of the last year , and I am pleased to see the increase announced by the Commission in appropriations allocated to this country .
Mr President , I beg your attention for a few seconds , because the wording of this oral amendment is different from the one on your voting lists .
President-in in-Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , the French Presidency obviously welcomes the Commission &apos; s presentation at the start of this year of an &apos; energy and climate &apos; package , which correctly reflected the goals laid down by the heads of state or government at their summit in March 2007 : reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 , whatever happens , and even by up to 30 % in the case of successful negotiations on a global agreement on a regime for the period after 2012 ; proposing a regulatory framework for the capture and geological storage of carbon dioxide and , Mrs Doyle , launching demonstration projects in this field ; and achieving by 2020 a 20 % share for renewable energies of the European Union &apos; s total energy consumption .
Whatever the motives , be it sexual exploitation or work , it is considered unacceptable by the Union &apos; s authorities .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although this draft directive has been considerably amended , I do not think it is any more appropriate now than it was at first reading .
Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) commitments are still not being fulfilled satisfactorily .
As a basis , this is entirely possible , but there is a difference between what is possible and the Utopian idea of proposing 20 weeks on full pay ; between what is feasible and what one can promise in Parliament , which will not be accepted by either the Council or the national parliaments .
Fearing , therefore , that I did indeed hear the Danish Prime Minister say this morning that he was not intending to renege on the positions adopted at the Brussels European Council , I would like to know exactly if , in response to the legitimate demands of the ten candidate country governments , you are going to make a better offer than the one made in Brussels , or if you are going to stick with what was decided at that European Council .
This labelling frenzy is admittedly necessary since there has been a loss in confidence , but , ladies and gentlemen , if you give up a specific definition of chocolate , then at least do so clearly and openly .
Like the report , we shall press the Commission and the Council to explain to the European Parliament how its position has been taken into account and what progress has been made with regard to cooperation between the Member States in combating tax fraud and evasion .
Tobacco consumption in Europe has not changed and the gradual reduction in European production has been replaced by tobacco imports .
I am delighted with the commitment that Mrs WallstrÃ¶m made in this regard during our last meeting on 13 October and I am convinced that all of the parliamentary committees will be active in ensuring that this programme is implemented .
Well , the least that one can say is that the programming exercise which took place there was quite strange , firstly in terms of its duration ( setting a seven year programme in two days of Council meetings was perhaps risky ) and vague in terms of the amounts .
However , this text is a step forward on which we must build .
This is also one of those rare liberalisation directives which fails to specify this aspect in a detailed manner .
The gap between rich and poor is too great .
I believe this debate will encourage us to remain alert and vigilant , to combat all forms of discrimination and to act on what has happened in the past , and not to act as though the situation has returned to normal .
Mr President , Commissioner , you have supplied us with the figures : today , footwear production in Europe has decreased by around 30 % , import prices have fallen by more than 20 % and , above all , the sector has lost nearly 40 000 jobs .
We have two main objections here , one on legal grounds and the other on the substance and also for economic reasons .
With regard to Mrs Flautre , who said just now that we were beginning the text of a report with exclusions , remember that all those workers concerned in the exclusion were , in any case , covered by directives relating very specifically to them .
An observation made here , of course , and elsewhere too .
I believe that there is an appropriation effect and another , far greater effect , to do with respect , and that gives the Member States powers .
It will remain stable and it will remain strong .
The plan for sustainable development based on solidarity must be affirmed as the Union &apos; s objective .
I believe that there is research to be done in these areas , particularly on the specific examples , in order to support the policies of sustainable development .
Any potential prerogative , granted on a de facto or de jure basis to an institution of one kind or another with regard to the issuance of currency should be very attentively examined .
We believe that banning entry to the countries of the European Union for people violating the Constitution and participating in repression is a very effective measure .
However , the rapporteur &apos; s explanatory statement and the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , both of which advocate visa liberalisation with Kosovo , are an unacceptable provocation .
Be that as it may , it is up to the European Parliament to decide , and I am ready to enter into a democratic debate as , in fact , I did five years ago .
What will happen , also , to the impact assessment on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament ?
We must be able to think with our mother tongue and also with , or in , other languages .
We approved this report particularly because of its first paragraph - please stay Mr Dell &apos; Alba , just for a few more moments - and although I agree that this paragraph is not entirely realistic , its political significance is very clear in our opinion .
Finally , it is with concern that the European Union takes note of the findings of the United Nations &apos; agencies and programmes on the ground .
Farmers will be able to obtain compensation to cover the loss of revenue attributable to the obligations imposed in the protection zones , particularly in drinking water catchment zones .
That is why I would once again like to thank Mrs Sanders-ten ten Holte , the rapporteur , as well as the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport and all the Members who have assisted us in this work .
It would never strike Mr Bushill-Matthews Matthews , who is known for his fervent support of the so-called called free market , to propose financial assistance for workers who have been made redundant by the very same industrial and financial corporations or their counterparts .
We will not be able to do everything in one fell swoop .
What I saw and heard on these occasions leaves no doubt in my mind .
The autocratic and repressive regime in Belarus , which wants to play down this public health crisis as far as possible and to silence scientists such as Mr Nesterenko and Mr Bandazhevsky , can no longer be used as an alibi by the European Union and pro-nuclear nuclear lobbies to hide the reality of Chernobyl and abandon the long-suffering suffering communities of these contaminated regions , to their fate .
It is hard to see how our positions will converge within a few months .
I think that it is now for the Commission to prepare its own initiative .
It is therefore absolutely essential that the Council anticipates and accepts what has been decided by the Convention and by the IGC , and therefore that , when the next Commission is constituted , and this is the most important thing in my eyes , the next President is elected by Parliament , thus anticipating what is decided by the Convention and the IGC .
Our two-pillar pillar framework ensures that all information relevant for the assessment of risks to price stability is taken into account in a consistent and systematic manner when taking monetary policy decisions .
The Presidency will obviously communicate the essential aspects of this debate to the future Presidency , because the European Union must now define its position clearly in advance of the September summit .
On climate change , we now need to turn our attention to the road to Copenhagen .
Road traffic creates 25 % of greenhouse gas emissions , and this is therefore a significant challenge .
In areas that fall under the umbrella of Community competences , the European Union , as well as the Member States when they implement Union law , are required to respect fundamental rights .
The United States , on the other hand , has an unchallenged lead in the manufacture of semiconductors and office machinery .
The result of the second reading will probably be acceptable overall .
I am convinced that these changes will generally be built on greater flexibility in the organization of work , and this will make it possible to reduce working hours on an annual basis .
Those hopes have been disappointed , to put it mildly .
Links between producers of steel products and downstream users have been strengthened , and joint research and marketing ventures have been established .
Protecting life means opening up new prospects in the fight against malaria .
The mad cow business has not enhanced the image of the Union , although the Union is far from being the party primarily responsible for that disaster .
It is critical that the legitimate right of the investor to have his investment protected is not transformed into an absolute right to invest without any restriction applying in terms of legislation and regulation , to the detriment of responsibilities and countries .
The third time that we were given the opportunity to see your ambitions for the six months of your Presidency and beyond was of course during your performance at the last European Council .
A successful outcome , firstly , marking the completion of the internal market , which has often been marred by past monetary upsets but which is also the result of the diligent efforts aimed at economic convergence that have been so resolutely made by the governments of the Member States since 1992 .
That , in my view , is a modern take on political action .
To move on to a different subject , I cannot help noticing that there is often a big difference between the statements that are made publicly and the commitment to these in practice .
Let us imagine for a moment that the dream comes true .
Commissioner , you said that you accept certain amendments but not others .
It is true that in all honesty much remains to be done , but considerable progress has been made over the last ten years .
The Serbs are wicked , all of them .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think this resolution is important because it refers to a positive decision by the Macedonian government , and unfortunately not by all the political forces of Macedonia , on the law on higher education which will at last allow young people from minorities , in particular the Albanian minority , to study in their mother tongue .
Furthermore , the introduction of insect-resistant resistant genes will make parasites more and more resistant , until eventually we find ourselves without any further biological defences .
You have not said anything about that .
Mr President , Mrs Ashton , that is enough !
The ambitious objectives then set enabled the European arrest warrant to be adopted , albeit with difficulty . This is an essential tool in the fight against terrorism and organised crime .
Tell the truth for once . You could not care less what the people of Europe want .
I should also like to express my thanks to Parliament for the flexibility it has shown in organising these hearings , which nevertheless retained all their substance and stringency .
In trade , the key element is confidence .
Immigrants must be guaranteed the rights to which every human being should be entitled .
Madam President , I would like to declare an interest in the subject of this report .
We can , therefore , only support the approval of the two texts which have been submitted to us today .
Thirdly , we must look for European added value .
The Commission , in proposing the depositing of instruments of ratification before the end of 2008 , guarantees that Member States will be in line with this timescale .
Calm down , my friend , calm down !
That social and economic convergence between the Member States is moving in the right direction , with a definite reduction in discrepancies in terms of income and jobs over the last decade , but also that there are still considerable disparities between regions , and occasionally within regions , with a frequent tendency to become more acute .
Finally , as regards tobacco , our proposals are also based on an extended impact assessment .
In fact , it is for all those reasons that I fail to understand the anti-globalists globalists .
In this respect , it does , in all sincerity , represent the best possible compromise .
It is true that this was not a success on the part of Georgia which had been very widely warned , in particular by the Americans , against provoking this reaction , even if Georgia itself was provoked , as this reaction would be well-prepared prepared , something of which I was completely unaware .
The Commission , by way of its Rapid Reaction Mechanism , contributed EUR 2.3 million to the deployment of 50 international observers in the province of Aceh .
On this issue too , I await your ideas , but I have explained my outlook .
Moreover , we have requested that ETA send its ceasefire letter to Hamas so that Hamas might take inspiration from it .
I will finish , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with this notion of better governance of partnerships at national level .
On the one hand , by reinforcing decent work - it would have been worth including this issue , rather than employment strictly for growth &apos; s sake , in the 2020 strategy ; moreover , are you counting on promoting the creation of green , intelligent jobs to develop a sustainable , united society ? - and , on the other , by increasing the overall employment rate in Europe , with particular emphasis on jobs for young people - you talked about this - but also for the over-fifties fifties .
In this spirit , the decision regarding the proposal for a regulation to reduce CO2 emissions from new vehicles must balance different aspects : sustainable development and safeguarding employment through innovative industrial policies at all levels , particularly at the social level .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , once again I should like to thank Mrs Cerdeira for her report and say very sincerely that I agree with several of the comments that have been made during the course of the debate about the minimal nature of the agreement that we have reached .
An analysis of the global impact of this project has already been carried out , and we are currently working on an in-depth depth assessment of its economic impact .
I simply wished to reiterate my previous answer while stressing that we could not claim that Turkey was being provoked in any way to adopt an aggressive position .
That is the path that my group calls on Europe , as a whole , to take .
Europe will be saved not by profit but by investment , by training , and I agree with what the Irish Prime Minister said about the importance of that subject .
The Member States of the European Union must refuse to extradite any person to a country where it is known that their death sentence is automatically programmed as soon as they set foot there .
This all constitutes a flagrant violation of French national sovereignty .
We also wish to protect the interests of citizens subject to the law , and we are calling for genuine and de facto equal treatment of lawyers registered in France , for example , and migrant lawyers .
Finally , the adaptation of educational models to the new professions of the green economy or the digital economy is a major challenge for education in Europe .
I would propose keeping paragraph 34 as it appears in the draft text , and adding Amendment No 42 to this text of paragraph 34 , by simply inserting the words &apos; and welcomes it in this context &apos; .
All this is in the pipeline . The Commission is working on it and would like to thank Parliament for its cooperation on this matter .
Just think what would happen if this revision were to fail .
And in an age when money is king ?
They cannot comprehend our reluctance in this area .
Mr President , I am going to confine myself to completing the remarks of Mr Jouyet , that seem to me , this afternoon , to well present our mutual interest in your work .
Mr President , I have another suggestion . We are currently preparing an amendment to the timetable , which means , as of next year , we could have an extra day in Brussels .
As Mr Cohn-Bendit Bendit rightly said , there are indeed many last-minute minute resistance fighters .
We must never forget that success is largely dependent on our ability to manage our internal affairs properly as well .
We can see the feverish way in which the potential for investors has snowballed and the phenomenon of &apos; start-ups ups &apos; has developed , but we are also aware of the staff turnover that typifies call centres due to the dreadful working conditions that reign in these new temples of Taylorism , which employ hundreds of thousands of people .
Accordingly , this issue must be a matter for the European Union .
The first is that the number of children per woman is low , with an Union average of 1.5 children , which is far below replacement rate , which needs to be slightly higher than 2 - 2.1 - in order to stabilise population size .
As we know , the field of biotechnology is a difficult one as it has an ethical , moral and religious dimension .
The examples are as numerous as they are revealing : biodiversity , the subject of a Convention in Rio , continues to decline sharply .
Europe shows its true colours in times of crisis .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we run the risk today of repeating ourselves .
I know that there are some Members in this House - fortunately they are in the minority - who believe that self-employed employed workers and their spouses should sort out their social security for themselves .
I also hope that it will make a genuine effort make the journey to Strasbourg easier for our foreign colleagues .
In accordance with its mandate , MONUC is playing an essential role .
I will be very clear : the amendment to which Mr Wolf Klinz is referring was mentioned and we reported the procedure that was followed , which is the procedure that we are still following .
( The sitting was suspended at 12 noon in anticipation of the formal sitting and resumed at 12.05p.m. )
What I mean by that is that the entry into force of the co-operation operation and partnership agreements is only a framework - a useful framework , certainly , but incapable on its own of guaranteeing that the reforms embarked upon are irreversible .
In my view , it should be mandatory for them to be listed on the transparency register .
We work with the services of the European Union and of all the Member States openly and under excellent conditions .
This vote has meant that equal access to health care and the financial viability of social security system will not be called into question .
This situation gives the European Union a historic responsibility , not against America , but against the dangerous desire for hegemony on the part of those who claim , on its behalf , to dictate to the world , only to lead that world into chaos .
The only salvation for poor countries is to be found in a radical transformation of the global economic system .
In the immediate future , let us encourage China to concentrate on supplying its internal market , let us re-establish establish the quotas according to the 2004 standards and let us not forget the poor textile-exporting exporting countries that are the main victims of this irresponsible policy .
We support the European Commission &apos; s proposal , as it means that this consensual programme that we have arrived at can be implemented .
What will we remember about the role of Europe in this historic situation ?
Regulating immigration must be done through another financial instrument and must lead to increased resources for FRONTEX .
We are fulfilling them , we are awaiting the Council &apos; s response , we are also waiting for the Commission &apos; s next steps and we shall issue an opinion at second reading , because this is a problem . It is right to raise it and we have done well to raise it in this way .
Firstly , asylum : the European Council called for the coordination of voluntary measures concerning the internal distribution of recipients of international protection who reside in the Member States most exposed to these pressures .
I know that the same causes always produce the same effects ; there are ethnic conflicts because the boundaries we marked out were often artificial boundaries .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank all the speakers who have taken part in this debate , not only to explain and clarify their positions , but also to express their feelings and emotion regarding the tragic situation in the Middle East , and , of course , the appalling events of yesterday .
However , not only out of a concern for coherence , at a time when the Union is completely opening up its markets to the least advanced countries , but also in view of the common history of the OCTs and the European Union , we do not understand why it is refusing them what it is granting to the least advanced countries .
We need a single rule : each Member State should be free to decide on its own public services .
However , the Government of Morocco is still rejecting them .
Unemployment rates and labour force participation have increased significantly in recent years , and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years .
Under these circumstances , we must as a matter of urgency accelerate investment in research in all fields , including nuclear technology , so that we can meet the challenges of the post-oil oil era and combat greenhouse gases .
He reaffirmed the validity of the results and expressed his willingness to enter into a dialogue on the cooperation efforts that the Commission intends to carry out as soon as possible .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - Mr President , the use of just in time delivery by industry and trade , with the ultimate aim , in short , of maximum immediate profit , means that dangerous goods are less and less in warehouses and secure factories and more and more on roads , rivers and railways and at sea .
Also in the pipeline is our Social Agenda .
The deployment of Tunisian police officers and their violent behaviour - which I have witnessed first-hand hand - prevented the Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League from being held at the end of May , but not , Mr Busuttil , as a result of a court ruling , given that 32 court actions have been taken against the LTDH .
The overcapacity of the EU fleet was estimated a few years ago at around 40 % .
It must take a much firmer stance against flags of convenience , especially those from Member States and from the islands of Kerguelen and Wallis and Futuna Islands .
Thank you for giving a positive tone to your report which thus demonstrates the efforts expended over the years by the Commission and the Council to implement Parliament &apos; s recommendations .
There needs to be a risk control plan not only for this region , but also for the town of Pristina and for other towns in Kosovo .
Madam President , this is just to say that in the vote on the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure I am listed as having voted against whereas in fact I voted in favour .
The Council &apos; s draft budget , on the other hand , provides for a 0.3 % reduction in comparison with the budget for 1996 - a reduction , that is , of ECU 900 million divided evenly between agricultural and structural expenditure .
Mr President , during the summer , following one particularly deadly attack , we were able to hear , broadcast by most television stations across the world , a Palestinian leader , someone who works closely with the prime minister , make a declaration to the effect that the Palestinian Authority should indeed once and for all commit to combating terrorism .
I would just like to remind Mr Wurtz that Mr Milosevic was the force behind his political family .
This means that those exempted from the visa requirement are businessmen and women , sportspeople and artists - at least when it comes to performing a one-off off activity - journalists and trainees , among others .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , provided with two reports on convergence , that of the EMI and that of the Commission , the main task of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was to give its opinion on the outline of the first circle of euro participants , and with regard to this central question , the committee &apos; s analysis is completely unambiguous .
The reform under way today , though , involves destroying all the small fishermen , all those who consume less oil , so as to make the richest even richer .
This is the real question which , at the same time , sets out the limit of this debate .
As you are aware , the EU and its European neighbours , 42 countries , were compelled to voice their reserves concerning the resolution on CO2 emissions trading , for we are in opposition with respect to the US and the rest of the world .
However , we do not find in the report this determination to ensure that the Parliament wields its full influence .
This is my answer to Mr Purvis
We might have more faith in the sincerity of the authors of this motion in &apos; deploring the recent murders , beatings and intimidation associated with the ... occupation &apos; if they at least deigned to recall the past massacres in which a handful of colonists dispossessed the indigenous population of its land and the decades of colonial violence and apartheid used to preserve this situation .
I do not really favour energy taxes as I do not believe that environmental problems can be systematically solved with taxation .
I share my colleagues &apos; view about speeding up mobilisation of this fund and about assessing its complementarity with other existing instruments such as the Social Fund .
Yesterday the Commission proposed a new initiative .
I think we have already paid a sufficient price for what was done there .
At a time when , in Europe , immigrants are being used as scapegoats for the social crisis and , in Asia , Washington is deploying its policy of a &apos; lasting war &apos; in the name of combating terrorism , is once again sending forces to the Philippines and is threatening to invade Iraq , we would hope that the EU would guarantee the rights of immigrants and would oppose American interventionism .
However , this report is above all an unexpected opportunity to adopt in extremis a mind-boggling boggling amendment , despite it having been rejected in committee , and drafted exclusively to prevent a single individual from performing a duty that is , moreover , recognised in all the world &apos; s parliaments : that of the oldest Member chairing the election of the President at the inaugural session .
Your priority is enlargement .
In 2008 , the Union also proved its capacity to adapt to change .
At a time when the wish is for the environment , particularly the protection of tropical forests , to be integrated into the development process , the appropriations allocated to this are being reduced .
Whichever country is affected , how does one assess the distress of fishermen , of those working in the tourism industry and of those citizens who see the oil slick spread further every day ?
Finally , declaring equal opportunities means that we must reject any form of discrimination against women , particularly with regard to wages .
There are at least three reasons why public intervention in this economic sector is as justifiable in the European Union as it is in other countries of the world .
We have come a long way recently and I am delighted with the Vienna decision to move towards a proper pact , which is what I have been calling for since 1996 .
However , the way in which national jurisdictions implement these laws means that European law falls outside their scope , all the more so as this European law , in my country , France , for example , takes precedence , under Article 55 of our constitution , over French domestic law .
I thank Mr Onesta for bringing his typical panache to the reform agenda and I commit myself to that agenda .
However , when considering the Commission as a whole , the sum of the minuses is a plus .
He is a rather shy young man - like his father for that matter , whom we have met on several occasions and whom we have the pleasure of welcoming today again in this Chamber - a young man who loved maths , who loved football and who would have returned to civilian life , of course , had he not been living , for four years now , in a hole , cut off from the world and cut off from his family .
The report talks of &apos; competitive needs &apos; but disregards the need to provide workers with the right to live and earn a wage .
We need to support the compromise resolution in order to send a signal to the Council and to the governments of the Member States and to support the efforts of the Secretary-General General of the United Nations in ensuring the success of the referendum process .
I would also like to say that cohesion is a major European policy .
In the second place , and I am addressing Mr Patten and the Council in particular , the European Union must , as a matter of urgency , have a policy in the Caucasus , the region which Chechnya is part of .
There may therefore have been some confusion .
This report is consensus-based based and not polemical , and Europe has in this an excellent instrument .
The problem is not this ratio between people of working and non-working working age , but the ratio between the considerable profits of large companies , the ever-increasing increasing income of the wealthier classes , and the constantly decreasing income of employees , both when working and as pensioners .
But was it necessary to overlook Milosevic &apos; s crimes so soon when the Dayton agreements on Bosnia were signed in 1995 ?
We feel that this amount was already far from sufficient given the considerable work that needs to be done to combat disparities in development in the future , enlarged Union .
I believe that one of the elements , one of our possible fears in relation to this Laeken declaration , is that it does not commit the members of the Convention to certain closed questions , or in any event does not allow all the issues which are vital to the future of Europe to be dealt with .
I therefore think that , given the prevailing attitude in the House , we can face the vote with confidence and hope to achieve a majority , which will enable us to put our point of view across at second reading .
I hope that you will recognise your ideas , including those that you expand upon in today &quot; s debate , in the action that we plan to carry out in 2006 .
Specific annual priorities should be established , matched with measures for implementation .
For much of the debate , I have had the impression that a kind of war was being fought to see whether it would be Great Britain or France who would lose face .
All the same , I would like to remind you of the painful problem of the restitution of property confiscated after the Second World War .
I very much regret it , but I am obliged to apply this Rule .
European law must , however , be the same for everyone .
French fishermen , in contrast , happily for them , are going to benefit from her invaluable support in the National Assembly .
The strategy devised in The Hague defines objectives and establishes a timetable that the Commission intends to respect .
It is a model that stands for quality and welfare .
Look at our European Community celebrating twenty years of its Parliament being elected by the people .
I should like to know what the Commissioner thinks of the German proposal that has been tabled , namely that we should set ourselves a new target of a 10 % reduction in greenhouse-gas gas concentrations by 2005 and a 15 % reduction by 2010 .
It is the wish of the French Presidency that we should succeed in defining precisely what these specific characteristics are and what their recognition implies .
I repeat , it is essential to prevent any backsliding and to establish sufficient health safety not only between the Member States but everywhere .
The climate issue and the climate negotiations have already been mentioned by a good many people here and by the Minister for European Affairs .
This is fine if it is a one-off off .
I fully supported the adoption of this report which approves Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area .
This is also the result of the wishes of all the Member States to provide the telecommunications industry with the means to create a services market on a European level , which had previously been much too fragmented .
At this point , it is not a question of competing to see who is in the best position to combat poverty , but of seeing things as they are .
What are these particularly generous rules of origin ?
However , I do not think that it is in Europe &apos; s interest to constantly aim low , particularly when it comes to food .
Therefore , the aim now is not to propose more legislation at any price but to make the existing legislation more accessible and intelligible .
A civilised society which has the resources of the European Union at its disposal ought to provide everyone with free , high-quality quality healthcare .
The European Union has everything to gain from stepping up the dialogue , by means of the Euro-Mediterranean Mediterranean Energy Forum .
This is a first step , but I would say that it is not the end of the beginning !
I especially welcome the work that has been done on the plan for housing assistance , since housing is the second priority for citizens , after jobs .
That is undeniable , it is clear , and we are working on it .
The additional resources given to Frontex will never be a substitute for the necessary solidarity that must unite the Member States , enabling them to act together in accommodating people who need international protection , and in accommodating a foreign labour force that is needed to meet the democratic challenges of the future .
That is the very least that can be done to reduce the risks of fire in the long term , and to preserve and restore the fragile ecosystems of southern Europe .
Therefore , we do not have the amendments available in one of the languages in use in the European Union .
If , tomorrow , we want innovation , our knowledge base has to be up to the task .
