I thank you , Mr President and I thank the rapporteurs . Thank you in advance for your vote on this issue tomorrow .
Madam President , I wish to make a comment about this resolution .
Is it fair for the United Kingdom to be the only one of the 15 to have reduced its net financial contribution following enlargement , thus excus@@ ing itself from all efforts to re@@ unify Europe ?
Russia is a strategic partner for us , as it is for the EU .
Mr President , the Voggenhuber report and the Commission communication on which it is based demonstrate only too well how Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union can become an infernal machine enabling the Union , in the name of preventing or penalising real or alleged violations of fundamental rights , to subject Member States to greater external supervision .
This point is important .
I would like to draw your attention to that .
Indeed , we are talking about a fundamental right that is not being applied in our Member States .
Furthermore , the European Commission negotiates these agreements .
As rapporteur , I was in the second delegation , and I was very impressed by the number of petitioners and found not only what they said but also their trust in Europe &amp; quot ; s response very moving .
It is only natural to standardise the arrangements for pre @-@ accession accession aid to that country with those applicable to the other candidates according to the Phare Programme model .
Russia expressed its wish for greater cooperation in the energy sector , which moves in the direction of our own interests .
I welcome Mr Barnier &amp; apos ; s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced .
The Commission has therefore decided to create and promote instruments which make the content of studies undertaken in other countries transparent .
To conclude , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , through this proposal we hope to put in place an effective instrument which will enable us to achieve our ultimate goal : to bring about a European area of freedom , security and justice in civil and commercial matters . This is something which affects not only the will and the everyday lives of our citizens but also the proper functioning of the single market .
In these circumstances , concerning a matter where we require all the political groups to adopt a clear position , where it is a question of fundamental conflict between Parliament and the Council , I believed that it was important to have an in @-@ depth depth debate and a full vote .
I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution approving the nomination of Mr Pa@@ we@@ ł Sam@@ ec@@ ki as a member of the European Commission .
Let us begin by improving the present Eurovignette Directive , that is my proposal , if the Commission agrees with me , in June 2008 .
I would have liked to discuss the harmonization of tax systems and many other areas which agree with Mr Caudron &amp; apos ; s analysis , which my group will of course support .
We are making quite good progress here .
That is why we will vote in favour of the report on combating exclusion .
How else can we interpret , at this very moment , the staggering inertia of the 25 faced with the Israeli Government &amp; apos ; s irresponsible tor@@ pe@@ doing of the initiative of the Palestinian President , in flagrant and continual breach of both the UN resolutions and the Quartet &amp; quot ; s road map ?
But I know that there we embark on the great challenge which lies ahead of us : democratic control of the genuinely strengthened cooperation which awaits us in the future , the cooperation which will be built around the euro .
Re@@ vision of either of the two regulations will entail a Commission proposal and the involvement of Parliament in accordance with the rules set out in the Treaties , which are in fact different for each of the regulations .
- Once again we are confronted with one of the most sordid aspects of contemporary society : trafficking in human beings .
I am glad that the European Parliament has endorsed that proposal in Mr Dess &amp; apos ; s report .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s role should be to advise and to provide the necessary tools for a certain degree of convergence between Member States , not to intervene in a policing or fiscal capacity .
Madam President , on this very important point , the French expressions &amp; apos ; ordre public &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; intérêt public &amp; apos ; in no way have the same mean@@ ings .
May I add that , in accordance with provisions for financial regulations , the Commission is prepared to provide financial support for the activities of Member States that allow the acc@@ red@@ itation of scientific police laboratories .
We need socio @-@ economic economic governance of the European Union .
Any kind of support : political , financial , local , national , European , international , lobbies , NGOs , chur@@ ches , and so on .
In order to make this happen , Europe must change its overly pessimistic and des@@ pon@@ dent position .
I understand , Mr High Representative , that you do not approve of this idea initiated by France , but also taken up by the United Nations Secretary @-@ General General and others .
But how should we respond ?
Mr President , are we not , with these blan@@ ket documents , going down the path of rein@@ venting the broad strategic guidelines ?
We also emphasise that the elimination of sexual exploitation and violence against women should also be a top priority for the European Union .
The priority is to strengthen the non @-@ proliferation proliferation regime and disarmament through the universal and full implementation of all relevant treaties and international agreements .
I even wish to inform you about the current status of countries that have signed up , to show you that there are many more countries than you think that have signed and have understood the mechanism .
We hope that , at the European Union &amp; apos ; s initiative , the ICAO will take on the responsibility of ensuring the adoption of the recommendations that it received with a view to strengthening international safety standards that apply to airports and air transport .
Madam President , with apologies to my friend , En@@ rique Barón Crespo , I should like to speak against this proposal .
Since then , the European Parliament and the Council , conscious of the need to swiftly adopt regulations relating to the continuation of the EGNOS and Galileo programmes , examined the text of the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal with a view to adoption at first reading .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , I am also extremely disappointed by this answer .
I believe that , in general , as far as the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean problem is concerned , we should understand and accept that Europe will not play a fundamental role in resolving contradictions unless it has the tools to implement its policy .
The Europe that the Commission is building is not the Europe that its citizens want .
Will it be before the end of the present term of office or will we have to wait for the next term ?
The European Union must shoulder its responsibilities and introduce legislation to put an end to this violence .
This is why we are lagging far behind in terms of European legislation on the topics under discussion today .
Madam President , it is clear that this topic of genetically modified organisms is a democratic urgency , an economic necessity and a legal imperative .
This particular resolution on a Single Market for Europeans puts the citizen at the heart of our concerns .
Thirdly , it seems important to safeguard the possibility of adapting this framework without having to resort to the excessively complicated and exceptional procedure of constitutional review .
That done , Mr President , I now intend to give my full attention to the debate .
We must welcome the spirit of the Commission proposals .
If the European Union , the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council were to provide the development aid that is so essentially needed then perhaps we would be entitled to react in this way , but we are not there yet .
I would like to thank Parliament very warmly for its cooperation from the very beginning to the very end of this process .
Our development model , focused as it is on the knowledge economy , requires the protection , at international level , of the fundamental right that is intellectual property .
Is that , however , sufficient reason to reform a COM which , even in the estimation of the Commission , has fulfilled its objectives ?
Moreover , in spite of greater parliamentary involvement in the monitoring process , the Council &amp; apos ; s refusal to formalise relations between our two institutions in this field is a deficiency .
However - and , yes , I am echoing your words here , Commissioner - this summit still had two virtues .
We need enhanced European cooperation for at least two good reasons .
Indeed , we believe that , to be effective , this policy must be reformed and enhanced .
The fact that we are credible and that our predictions concerning inflation correspond to our definition of price stability offer the European economy a particularly favourable financial environment .
I myself have two minutes , and I am grateful to those who allowed me this time .
In the light of the legal framework , it will reass@@ ess the need to bring forward proposals for additional legislation .
I think we have done an excellent job .
Together with my colleagues Mr Savary and Mr Si@@ fun@@ akis , I tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis of the text on which Parliament is to vote tomorrow morning .
None of this of new .
There are the movements of the global market , there is the policy of the United States , and we are looking on .
We are concerned here , in actual fact , with the formation of European citizenship , a citizenship to which Parliament must contribute in order to ensure the development of the European public space .
It increases our collective capacity to respond to certain challenges which were not explicitly envisaged in the Treaty .
the spou@@ se or non @-@ married married partner of the applicant ( including same @-@ sex sex partners ) ; although it should be noted that the provision covering non @-@ married married partners only applies in Member States where the position of non @-@ married married couples is comparable to that of married couples ;
If the same stringency in budgetary matters prevails as much at the level of the States as in the Union , here it is chiefly a response to the demands of some Member States , and we know that the first victim of this stringency will be the common agricultural policy .
To be clear , that is my personal opinion , even though I know that it is going to be very difficult .
Secondly , speaking of a constitution , we must be careful not to be too naive .
Mr President , an oral amendment has been proposed .
The Commission considers that a high level of withdraw@@ als is not justified in view of the r@@ arity of the fishery resources , both inside and outside Community waters .
Mr President , I too wish to stress how important relations with the southern countries are for Europe , in particular with those in the Mediterranean Basin .
Consequently , I would urge the House to support this motion of inadmissibility .
The battle of figures that some are beginning to use polem@@ ically in fact mas@@ ks a fundamental debate about our ambitions for Europe , something which requires a constructive and rational interinstitutional dialogue .
H@@ om@@ osexu@@ als still suffer discrimination far too often , and some still consider this to be a normal state of affairs .
Scienti@@ sts throughout the world are all telling us that global warming is irre@@ versi@@ bly changing the way we live and greenhouse gas emissions are only serving to make these disasters worse .
Although Parliament &amp; apos ; s proposals are , financially , better than those of the Council , we have not voted in favour of the amendments , as we do not wish to sanction this farce .
Mr President , respect for human rights , which has its roots in our commitment to the dignity of the person and thus in our oldest spiritual traditions , deserves the utmost attention from the countries of Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we expect three major policy guidelines from the next summit in Cardiff .
Schnellhardt report ( A4 @-@ 000@@ 3 000@@ 3 / 99 )
The Amsterdam Treaty continued this trend by strengthening the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s legislative powers and requiring the President of the Commission - whose position was also strengthened - to have the confidence of Parliament .
It is just that , whenever public money is involved , everyone needs to be able to account for how that public money was used .
As a result of this cofinancing proposal , Mr President , I question the Commission &amp; apos ; s objectives .
However , while we have a duty to propose a text that takes account of the public &amp; apos ; s fears , we must not , for all that , neglect the demands of researchers .
This is a sensible economic and social proposal , which the had made during the 2004 regional elections with regard to the subsidies paid by the regional councils .
The Commission welcomes Parliament &amp; apos ; s decision to follow up the report it drafted .
Our rapporteurs have done some very good work on behalf of the European institutions , for which I thank them .
In the same context , the proposals that the EU should develop its own indicators to gauge respect for human rights , that a special European Parliament envoy should be nominated for prisoners of conscience and that a human rights website should be launched on the Europ@@ ar@@ l site on the Internet , are well worth considering .
Firstly and fundamentally , the main point of my report is to emphasise that the European States cannot just extend the repressive aspect of the asylum and immigration policy , while , at the same time , neglecting whole sections of it regarding legal immigration and the integration of nationals from developing countries who have legally settled in our countries .
I hope that the next European Council will take inspiration from this approach .
Our resolution is addressed to the UN Human Rights Council , an institution that one would have hoped to promote to the r@@ ank of the world &amp; apos ; s enforcer of respect for rights , values and the most fundamental freedoms .
As the rapporteur has said , the directive is designed to ensure that the handling of cargo in our ports respects strict rules , so as to prevent damage to ships during loading or unloading of heavy bulk cargo .
We are convinced that this will enable us to make significant reductions in the costs of business and investment in our countries , whilst still giving each Member State the freedom to set levels of company taxation .
Are we on the right track in this respect ?
In addition , these measures would damage the Union &amp; apos ; s external trade policy by making it more complicated to conclude future free trade agreements , whether bilateral or multilateral .
One example is the report drawn up under the responsibility of Mr Dem@@ i@@ ro@@ k , Secretary of the Turkish Su@@ preme Coordination Council for Human Rights , who has proposed a very wide @-@ ranging ranging raft of reforms to the Constitution .
For its part , and like the House , the Commission does not support the idea of a new chamber , which would , in reality , be a third chamber .
It is playing its part and is ready and willing , alongside the Presidency , to seek out the fairest solutions .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , transatlantic relations are going through a difficult period .
I also feel that we must remind our fellow Members from Greece that the Mac@@ edon@@ ian people are being humiliated , mainly because of the attitude of Greece , which still forces all the countries of the European Union as well as Greece , to use the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m &amp; apos ; F@@ Y@@ R@@ O@@ M &amp; apos ; to refer to Macedonia .
We are ambitious , and so are you .
Will we , one day , have the will ?
Without repeating all the points , I will insist only on those which to me seem essential .
Why do we need this particular proposal ?
Finally , I would like to ask the Council to include in its agenda relations with India and preparations for the New Delhi forum , and I would urge all Member States to participate in enhanced cooperation .
After the vote on Amendment No 13 :
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Petitions certainly deserves our full attention . It often takes centre stage in the House , although it has actually been threatened with extinction at times .
Finally , this is a social issue which is very sensitive in many countries .
This dialogue has been launched , particularly on human rights .
Should you not wish to make the changes I have proposed , then in that case - and only in that case - Mr Heaton @-@ Harris Harris , you would be right , we would work to the agenda previously agreed .
The final compromise does not respond to consumer concerns , since consumers would like to see guarantees of food safety and to see proper assessment of the risks of releasing GMOs into the environment being carried out .
This is something to which we also attach great importance .
Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , you should know that this Parliament , which was prepared to say that the intergovernmental conference should be revised and make a multitude of demands , will tomorrow probably welcome the fact that you decided at Helsinki to allow us two observers , rather than two representatives , and that you wish to confine yourselves to matters which Parliament considered were absolutely out of the question .
I was just quoting from the report .
C@@ all@@ an@@ an report ( A5 @-@ 0218 0218 / 2001 )
Such acts within the European Union itself are quite unacceptable .
We are talking about public health , and hence of serious events , which must be treated as such , in a strict and , of course , transparent manner .
Europe is not neutral in this matter .
The Commission has expressed a preference : for the time being , it does not want to draft new legislation on the matter , and this is for two reasons .
My third point , finally , is the possible clarification of the definition of competences within the European Union .
You are right , Mrs Quisthoudt @-@ Rowohl Rowohl , to emphasise that this agreement has been made possible thanks to the hard work during fruitful discussions in which everyone has been involved .
Madam President , I would like to begin with a procedural issue .
I am taking account of this new regulation , which was proposed by the previous Commission , under Mr Barroso &amp; apos ; s authority , and which improves matters .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not know whether it was deliberate or accidental , but the day chosen to open the European Council , 8 March , is International Women &amp; apos ; s Day .
P@@ ower can be abused by the State .
In February the Council , on the basis of the Commission &amp; apos ; s guidelines , Commissioner , adopted conclusions containing a number of operational elements , which I will mention here .
Yes , we needed to call for a lasting solution to this conflict , which has been going on now for over 30 years .
We will all have to work towards that goal and I will promise to try to make a difference at least in the regions where I am responsible .
For example , in the case of fish caught in their waters but imported here , this will be sufficient .
The European Parliament , national governments and national parliaments share a great responsibility in this respect .
What , then , are Europe &amp; apos ; s priorities ?
Now , in the eyes of the citizens , the European Union is not only a market , not only a single currency , but it also has a social dimension .
And in order to meet the completion date of June 1997 , the Dublin European Council must have a global draft Treaty which will form the basis of later negotiations .
I tabled an amendment on this subject and I would invite you to support this work to put our Parliament in a position to exercise the greatest vigilance it can over this crucial issue of the freedom of the press , which also affects the question of the independence of the judiciary and the drawing up of the new constitution .
I voted against the second part , against the comm@@ entary , and I am shown in the register as having voted in favour .
Unfortunately , the Commission &amp; apos ; s rather un@@ ambitious proposal that has been submitted to us has taken no account of it .
However , as regards the legality and regularity of underlying operations - that is to say , payments to and from the EU coff@@ ers - the Court notes that adapted risk management is not always guaranteed when it comes to important areas of expenditure .
I myself believe that we do most certainly have an ethical problem .
I should also like to pay tribute to my fellow Members present here today , from all the political groups - especially the coordinators - and to the Committee on Regional Development , for having supported my proposal , which was to build on the advantage that we had and to say that , since the Commission could no longer take the initiative , we should do .
- Mr President , I should like to present my warmest congratulations to the rapporteur for her excellent work .
Mr President , it is true that we would at times like the Commission to show the same sense of responsibility and effectiveness as the European Parliament .
Along with the rapporteur , we have co @-@ signed signed two amendments which I hope Parliament will be able to adopt in order to further improve on the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
By sending a delegation of MEPs to monitor the smooth running of the ballot , the European Parliament is showing its interest and its desire to support the ongoing democratic process in Azerbaijan .
I believe that this has been a fine collective success .
It is not a question of interference , but of helping a people in danger .
Having said that , I am not questioning the role of the K@@ F@@ OR , the role of the United Nations in Kosovo , at all , but we cannot consider and plan an &amp; quot ; occupation &amp; quot ; of Kosovo for many years without running serious risks .
We must work out who should pay and we must make the calculations together .
I would also express the wish of my Group and of a good many NGOs to see the Charter evolve and continue to improve , in order to guarantee , amongst other things , more effective protection and rights for the citizens of the European Union , for employees , for the citizens of third countries and for the socially marginalised .
The monetary policy , for instance , ought to protect stability , which it does , but it also ought to stimulate growth and adjust parity in the best possible fashion to defend our exports , although as things stand today this is unfortunately not yet the case .
In any event , this is the intention of our directive and I have no doubt that the Commission and the Member States will ensure that it is implemented .
As a democrat among the Members who asked for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be included , as it stands , in the draft Constitution , I cannot agree with his conclusions .
It is true that the free movement established by the European Union is a fundamental right , but this is reserved for its own nationals .
They unfortunately have a reputation for resorting to systematic and excessive violence .
The Commission and the Council claim to want this .
It is our turn to put our words into action .
Mr President , having listened to you , I have to say that we are disappointed .
Europe has begun to put in place effective regulation , but Europe must not find itself isolated .
It would be shameful for our leaders to go to Beijing without ut@@ tering a single word about the harsh reality of the situation .
However , like several of my fellow Members , I also wanted to say that the problems that we are having to face - problems which the whole of the European Union is having to face at the moment - cannot be resolved by one Member State alone .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Goebbels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .
The Commission is prepared to act along these lines .
The European Council stressed the need for enhanced cooperation with the main countries of origin and of transit and asked the Commission to look at possible ways of cooperating in practice with these countries .
This is a very important and sensitive point , especially as it relates to the future of the European Union .
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will , of course , very soon benefit from the instruments that have been set in place by the Union to cover the entire Balkan region , beginning with the CA@@ RD@@ S programme and also the activities of the European Agency for Reconstruction .
This time , the Parliament should explicitly name those services and departments of the Commission that could take up the cu@@ dg@@ els and exert more pressure on Mr Santer to rise to this challenge .
A compromise must be reached in Berlin and this is perfectly possible . It is possible because a great deal of headway has been made with the preparatory work , especially on the legislation .
Thank you very much for the impetus you have given .
I think this has to be said .
Secondly , this notice is useful for those concerned since it actually sets out what the principles are by which the Commission will apply the rules of competition , especially to the reserved services , because there should not be any confusion about this .
This report reminds us how important it is for the European Union to promote the role of women in economic and social life , both by means of Community policies and in the context of cooperation with third countries and the Mediterranean countries .
This was a crucial point indeed .
This subject , which has given rise to much debate , is a very topical one , given that yesterday two European regulations entered into force which require manufacturers to label &amp; quot ; food and food ingredients &amp; quot ; containing more than 1 % of GMOs , together with &amp; quot ; genetically modified additives and flavourings &amp; quot ; , although without setting out any threshold value in this case .
These should be reflected in the synergies between European instruments , particularly between the framework programme and the Structural Funds .
We are working , and I am working , on all fronts , in other words , improving the quality of the legislation , practical cooperation and solidarity between the Member States and between the Union and third countries .
You can however be sure , ladies and gentlemen , that the Commission will examine any new initiative carefully and with an open mind .
The ultimate objective that is before you is to strengthen the European Union and its power to act .
This founding principle of Europe is today being challenged , indeed , by the application of the death penalty in a considerable number of places throughout the world .
The current situation certainly calls for an international and multilateral response .
I hope and believe that the proposals which I presented to you last month can help to unblock the negotiations .
I continue to believe that a strong European Union cannot be built without bringing national social standards closer into line .
Mr President , I must firstly congratulate Mr Pirker on his excellent report .
Secondly , we need to provide new answers to the problem of the debts of poor countries .
I will not repeat here the comments made by Members , because I almost entirely agree with them .
The European Union represents everything I support , because I support understanding between peoples and European solidarity - a solidarity that must not be jeopardised by a flawed reform of the Financial Perspective that aims to destroy solidarity instruments .
From that perspective , the situation is urgent .
Obviously these questions are extremely important .
The measures that are adopted should furthermore impose the same restrictions , at least on European tobacco companies , when they manufacture their products under licence , or sell their poison , in the countries of Eastern Europe , in Africa or elsewhere .
The Commission should also review its proposals with the aim of strengthening the Union &amp; apos ; s civil protection capacity , in order to exploit the expertise and geographical location of the outermost regions and the OCTs , which aspire to be support points in the event of intervention outside Europe .
We must , I believe , put this lesson from the crisis to good use .
I promise you that in the new Cohesion Fund we are going to ensure that we strike a better balance .
Furthermore , I wonder about the proportion of the aid to developing countries that will be managed by the European Union and that will be in the region of 20 % .
For that , then , there are three great guiding principles .
It affects our capacity to defend a certain vision of the European commitment to our major projects and our industries .
I would like to say one last thing .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am going to give you the opinion of the legal service and of the President of the European Parliament , since he has of course been consulted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure .
As regards Eurojust and the European Judicial Network , the Member States , taking inspiration from our communication of October 2007 on the subject , have clearly shown their desire for convergence .
Ou@@ tra@@ ged by these massacres , our Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Fisheries recently refused , quite rightly , to vote for the Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and Guinea .
( For the results and other details on the vote : see Minutes )
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies .
When it comes to protecting health and the environment we must be ambitious if we really want to improve the situation .
The crisis must be confronted and I propose three concrete actions .
Mr President , distinguished Members of Parliament , this Commission hit the ground running .
We welcome its involvement in the Middle East peace process .
This situation leads to human suffering and social tensions .
Should not the Stability and Growth Pact be supplemented , Commissioner , with a pact to coordinate economic policy , which would give a boost to growth and employment and would seek to stimulate public and private investment in research on infrastructure and regional development , and in training and the labour market ?
We also need far more research funding in Europe .
Some progress has , admittedly , been made since Seattle , at least in practice , without making any formal changes to the rules of procedure .
In this resolution , Parliament is assuming its responsibilities .
In this respect , we should stress the commendable work done by the Hungarian Presidency and the quality of the negotiators from this Parliament .
I believe that this is a fundamental point .
in writing . - I would like to begin by thanking the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the European Union , the excellent Slovenian Prime Minister Jan@@ ez Jan@@ š@@ a , his government and his administration for the very admirable and difficult work they have done .
As regards my feelings on this matter , I am aware of and understand the sensitivity of the issues that the Minister has described , issues which directly relate to the position , the role , and the influence of each country .
The Watts report is concerned with strengthening port state control and with rigorous inspections and procedures . We support the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s calls for the use of voyage data rec@@ orders .
It is a matter of scientific progress , but also ethics and mor@@ als : in short , value judgments .
We consider it preferable to propose this procedure , which we have already followed many times , which consists of voting on the amendments and postponing the vote on the proposal .
Of course , we are going to take what is on offer .
I am not a Christian Democrat , so I do not believe in miracles , but I do want to salute the European Parliament as such , because it has made a major contribution to this project .
This is what the people and the taxpayers of Europe expect of us .
These are measures that must not be ignored .
In my opinion , it would be dangerous to over@@ use the postponement clause or to use it in order to voice various concerns , which are certainly understandable but which call for a different response .
The Commission appreciates the unfailing support it receives from Parliament .
In this regard , the creation of the European Research Council represents a major step forward .
The programme was adopted by the Council and by the European Parliament , and included a revision of Directive 95 / 53 / EC .
This is therefore a complementarity that we have been eager to implement .
We were convinced that the EU needed the constitutional framework .
I hope this will be reflected in the vote tomorrow .
The Commission is currently examining this petition .
Mr President , I believe you are quite right to refer a number of matters arising in connection with this vote to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure .
A transitional measure must in fact be found to reconcile respect for the Treaty of Lisbon with Article 5 of the 1976 Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage .
However , neither did we want to vote against this report , which contains important elements , in particular , as regards social and environmental standards , which we must be able to integrate into tender procedures , recommendations to facilitate SME access , and a clear call for vigilance in public @-@ private private partnership contracts .
It is clear that we condemn religious integr@@ ist terrorism .
Do you believe that Europeans will , in the long term , accept this unra@@ velling of what they have gained , in the name of the free market and the ho@@ ly gra@@ il of competition ?
This report calls for Russia to &amp; apos ; renounce all protectionist measures &amp; apos ; and threatens reta@@ liation if Russia does not b@@ end to this demand .
We are also witnessing major internal division within the European Union and preparation for a war that would constitute a real confrontation between civilisations and would undoubtedly strengthen the terrorism we are trying to fight .
There is no shortage of ideas .
It is important that all the Member States be able to participate in this instrument .
Surely we need no further reason to support the proposed directive in its current form , quite rightly amended by our rapporteur , Mr Maaten , whom I must congratulate on his remarkable work , the broad outlines of which I have supported .
Quite simply , what is being asked for is a larger budget ; in other words , more taxes for Europeans .
I shall read out the interpretation given under Rule 115 ( 4 ) , which states : &amp; apos ; In the case of compromise amendments tabled after the conclusion of a debate ... the President shall decide on their admissibility case by case &amp; apos ; .
I see these threats and the counter@@ measures to tackle them as a part of the human security concept .
The Commission has drafted recommendations , in response to a request frequently raised by market operators .
I see these proposals as positive developments .
This approach , the Single Market Act , is a comprehensive , overall approach to the single market , a collective approach .
We are working on the issue and we are going to put the final touches to it to ask all of these questions , whilst taking proper account of what falls under national responsibilities for pensions systems and what it is possible to do at European level , especially in relation to all these private pension funds and their proliferation on the European markets .
We have a choice of two solutions .
That is why I shall oppose the request for a moratorium which has been included in point 6 of the compromise resolution when it is put to the vote before this House .
Several proposals have already been submitted to Parliament and , before the end of the year , a document should enable us to enhance our thoughts and actions concerning legal and illegal immigration .
Make sure it remains an informal European Council , Mr President ; that is what we expect of you .
It would appear that this long and detailed document is currently under discussion in the Council and between the Council and the Commission .
I voted in favour of the Rapkay report and of State subsidies for the coal industry .
We cannot reject these people simply because we do not want to slow down our kind of Europe . We have no right to do so .
. - I have voted in favour of my fellow MEP &amp; quot ; s , Mr Bowis &amp; quot ; s , excellent report on patient mobility .
The way they are planned , the grants to NGOs seem to us questionable .
That said , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the public data concern a particularly sensitive area since they concern public information , managed either directly or indirectly by the public authorities .
I consider that the policy of consolidating Community policy should be a priority of the European Commission and that the current situation is not in order , particularly with regard to the Member States and citizens .
- Mr President , I should like , personally and on behalf of my group , to congratulate the rapporteur and those of my fellow Members who sit on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , who have managed to work together efficiently to table these compromise amendments with the aim of having this report adopted in one single reading .
That will result in a gradual reduction of our fleet .
The truth is , the supervisory authorities are national authorities .
A knowledge @-@ based based Europe is a multilingual Europe , the development of an original system of movement between universities , a vision of the organisation of the academic Community as a network : these are the innovative elements .
This reform of the CAP over 10 years is a commitment to a new type of modern agriculture , which takes into account all of the social , economic and environmental realities of the agricultural profession .
We must stop this regime from doing harm and in particular from using weapons of mass destruction .
Ambi@@ gu@@ ity appears to be the hallmark of the Commission &amp; apos ; s attitude to this matter .
It is true that the regulatory framework is being applied very un@@ evenly .
Mr President , what I am about to do is not standard practice .
Ladies and gentlemen , I therefore urge you to think carefully about the vote you will take tomorrow .
Political reforms are needed , and we need to support these .
As I believe President Prodi said in this Chamber , the Commission thinks that education and citizenship are very strong aspects of future European policy .
I would remind you that under Article 121 of the Treaty , Member States must coordinate their national economic policies .
Of course , it will not be Parliament that defines this policy , but the Commission , who have made the first step through this interesting communication , and the Council .
That is the way it is when it comes to the principles of the internal market and of competition - principles that are essential to our Community , that are inscri@@ bed in the Treaties and that the Commission is - let us be clear - absolutely obliged to respect , as it is obliged to respect the principles of state intervention and of the general interest .
We also need to progress very metho@@ dic@@ ally , very openly and with a lot of dialogue , to enable the Irish people to come to a decision .
However , we all know that Europe cannot do more and better with less money .
This debate is , therefore , important and I believe that we must now set a clear political objective . That , I believe , is what the Commission wants .
At this time of crisis , it will be necessary throughout the budgetary process to reiterate our expectations with regard to European policies .
I believe , in fact , that the wording found in the compromise , combined with the European Commission &amp; apos ; s declaration , represents a major step forward .
Following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon , the European Union &amp; apos ; s diplomatic activities have been be@@ ef@@ ed up with a view to raising Europe &amp; apos ; s profile on the international stage .
Whether it be about specifying 18 years as the minimum age at which an applicant for asylum can be registered on the Eurodac database , about er@@ asing personal data once legally recognised status has been acquired or about substituting the expression &amp; apos ; third @-@ country country national &amp; apos ; for &amp; apos ; ali@@ en &amp; apos ; , the Council has not seen fit to take account of Parliament &amp; apos ; s opinion and has been supported in this by the Commission , which has also declined to take account of it .
Turkey continues to maintain a hostile stance , Greece and our Parliament continue to block the financial protocol , the Cyprus dossier has been suc@@ ked under and the Fifteen choose to assume different positions whereas we need to adopt a clear and consistent common position .
Today there are more of them in existence .
The Commission made this proposal too restrictive by limiting set @-@ aside aside production to organic farming , not through any admiration for organic farmers , but because it did not want to chi@@ p away at the WTO agreements by adopting a measure which would favour all EU producers .
We should continue the research in a way that protects our complete freedom , and without allowing anything to be imposed upon us ; we should act with extreme caution , not giving way to pressure , and should take a more rigorous approach to consumer information . These , Madam President , seem to me to be the broad lines that we should be following on this essential issue .
We must retain the competitiveness of this European industry .
The final dec@@ ep@@ tion is this : what is the point of a European Charter of Fundamental Rights if it is not applied throughout the Union ?
Mr President , Commissioner , the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance . Indeed , six months after the election of this new Parliament , we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Yes , I do believe , as Mr Ortega has quite rightly pointed out , that there is a need for immigration in Europe , and we are not denying that .
The resolution therefore asked the Commission why it had not undertaken the review of the directive that should have been made in 2003 .
Mr President , I want to make a point of order that is a matter of form and will take only a moment .
It is therefore essential that we remedy this situation by taking appropriate , practical measures .
The criticisms directed at the outgoing President are mistaken about an essential fact , namely that the Commission is able to make proposals and that it is the Member States that lay them down .
Next , in terms of health , the increase in infec@@ tious diseases ( particularly HIV ) remains worrying .
Mr President , President of the Commission , the employment situation in Europe is very worrying , as my fellow Members have just pointed out .
This is a very delicate subject for many Member States , but the Commission is trying to make discussions progress as far as possible .
The difficulty lies in the fact that once the dispositions are ratified , European parliaments make an act of faith in the creation of a new European law while depriving themselves of parliamentary control .
But political dialogue is equally necessary in order to persuade China that the key to becoming part of international society lies in the respect of universal values .
Since 1995 , the ideas put forward , mainly by the European Parliament - and here I agree with Mrs Pack that the initi@@ ator of all this policy was undoubtedly the European Parliament - have been put into practice , at least in part .
And I shall be supporting Amendment No 38 , which makes it impossible to extend an authorisation to market a similar non @-@ orphan orphan medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication .
The UN inspectors responsible for monitoring disarmament in Iraq have destroyed or ordered the destruction of the stocks of arms , material and products that could lead to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction .
( O@@ ff @-@ microphone microphone intervention from Mr Schulz )
I therefore welcome this European ambition that I have found here this afternoon , and I welcome this sense of urgency that I have encountered this afternoon .
As regards relations with the national parliaments , I want to distance myself from what Mr Donnelly has just said .
It also involves , and I will end here , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , clarifications on the contribution of the European Union .
It is in this spirit that it is prepared to help Turkey find a solution to the Kurdish problem in particular .
Madam President , through your good offices , I should particularly like to say good morning and welcome to Mrs Baldi and her substitute .
Yes , we need to break our addiction to fossil @-@ based based energy and hazardous energy .
No , the proposal to create an independent organisation - under the auspices of UEFA , perhaps , but independent - would enable us genuinely to move in the direction of financial control and financial transparency .
Mr President , at a time when unemployment is high in the countries of the European Union , it is vital to draw up a European employment strategy .
Finally , there is the disaster in Asia , which we have just been discussing , and which is a clear illustration of the need for good cooperation between the European Union and the United States when such cal@@ am@@ ities strike .
This report underlines the urgent need for a Community initiative to effectively combat violence against women .
In short , we need politics in the true sense of the word , since it is on this that the future of Europe hinges .
In mid @-@ November November , the Commission initiated a detailed analysis of the SIS II solution , which is currently being developed by H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ P@@ ack@@ ard P@@ ack@@ ard / Ster@@ ia , in cooperation with experts from the Member States , and with the help and assistance of two well @-@ known known IT consul@@ tan@@ cies .
To finish , I can tell you that in our daily contacts with the governments I am seeing a recognition of the need for this European dimension .
I do not feel , however , that he was very clear on the political benefits .
To fulfil its mission , the service has to find its rightful place in the architecture of the European Union , under the leadership of the High Representative who , as Vice@@ President of the Commission , is fully accountable to this Parliament and who is responsible for coordinating the other aspects of the Union &amp; apos ; s external action within the Commission .
Copenhagen has therefore put in place all the necessary elements to ensure that the European Union will never see the light of day .
However , it is also very important from the economic point of view , so crucial is it for us still to be capable of being in the vanguard of the fight against climate change , providing it with its impetus .
We are in principle able to accept part of Amendments Nos 3 , 7 , 8 and 9 .
This agreement represents a risk to human rights and is a manifestation of Europe &amp; quot ; s serv@@ il@@ ity towards the United States at a time when the United States is not demonstrating very much openness in relation to human rights and the protection of citizens .
Be@@ e@@ keepers in many regions of different Member States have been observing increased mortality rates among bees for several years now .
In actual fact , implementing this clause ex@@ poses the countries concerned to the threat of sanctions by the most powerful groups and States .
I hope that the Irish presidency will incorporate in its proposals all the elements we know to be indispensable in order to face future commitments .
Evidently , we all think now that , unfortunately , Hungary &amp; apos ; s situation is not an isolated case , and we must in some way consolidate the cus@@ hi@@ on which will allow the European Union to meet such requests .
This responsibility borne by the Commission implies a rigorous attitude , independence of judgement and a duty of rigorous evaluation .
In accordance with the European Employment Strategy , the Member States have put mechanisms in place for meeting this objective as part of their national action plans .
When we have had to vote on interinstitutional agreements , we have had a report and we have had the approval of the interinstitutional agreement , which was proposed in the report .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report , which each year gives us an opportunity to examine the fundamental rights situation in the European Union , provides an excellent reminder for those who would prefer to forget the universal nature of fundamental rights .
No , I do not think so .
The strengthening of supervision and regulation is equally necessary .
Member of the Commission . - Very briefly , Mr President , obviously I take due note of the splendid remarks and specific proposals made here , and have every intention of passing them on to my colleague Benita Ferrero @-@ Waldner Waldner and the Commission .
In view of the political background of this country , it is essential that its government assume its responsibilities in full within the framework of the legislative and institutional process .
In some areas , has the wording of the report not been made more cumbersome than is necessary ?
In tabling its proposal , which was fully supported by Parliament , the Commission envisaged having recourse to the codecision procedure in the case of all standards of general scope , such as this one , defining the essential features of common trade policy .
At multilateral level , we have the framework of the WTO .
I am therefore glad that Parliament has been heard this time after a very long battle with the Member States in the Council .
Therefore , I am in favour .
This is an important step forward for all European businesses and for all small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises , which have been waiting a long time for this instrument , an instrument which is indispensable for innovation , research and development and competitiveness in Europe .
I believe that you are right and that these are the areas we must work on .
We have to act and to protect ourselves .
The accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights will contribute a further mechanism for upholding human rights , namely the possibility of taking cases to the European Court of Human Rights .
Otherwise , just to make things clear , if we voted in favour of the censure motion , that decision was in no way directed against the Commission as an institution - quite the contrary .
The major producing countries , supported by a majority of MEPs who are sensitive to the industry &amp; apos ; s arguments , have succeeded in preventing us from setting an ambitious emissions reduction target .
In actual fact , we have been discussing this target for more than 30 years .
Should this Parliament have a call @-@ back back right , we will require measures for implementing this right at level 2 .
I also wish to thank the Commission for having cooperated so effectively throughout the preparation of this document .
C@@ are also needs to be taken not to encourage situations to develop that make the people &amp; apos ; s difficulty and misfortune even worse .
The third is that the transfer of data to third countries is subject to important conditions and safeguards to provide an adequate level of protection .
That communication also contains extremely precise and specific guidelines .
What is the reasoning behind this hastily cob@@ bl@@ ed @-@ together together policy ?
I believe that , behind the way in which this matter is handled , the issue of knowing how to implement a lead supervis@@ or at European level remains altogether crucial , and we will have to return to it over the next few years .
It is an exercise in mutual recognition , with extremely detailed work on certification , endors@@ ements and mutual recognition .
As President of the Commission , my party is Europe .
Of course , we all know that the Community budget , at less than 1 % of GDP , can only make a limited contribution to a European @-@ wide wide stimulus .
I believe this is a good way to proceed and I see that , in the commitment the Commission agreed to sign through what is now known as a revision clause , it is invited to look at the extent of its competence and justify any changes in legislation or the absence of such changes .
The Commission will no doubt confirm this shortly when it submits to us its report on the human rights situation in Turkey , as it formally undertook to do at the time of the ratification of the customs union .
I would like briefly to go over the three points that I championed for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament within the Committee on Culture and Education .
In that sense , we welcome the recommendations made in the Watson report on demonstrations organised in conjunction with the European Council .
I also appeal to the working group on parliamentary reform to take account of the specific characteristics of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the constraints affecting it , because , when the parliamentary calendar is compiled these days , some of our commitments clash with the work of the Assembly .
The next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 101 0@@ 101 / 2000 ) by Mr Varela Su@@ an@@ zes @-@ Carpegna Carpegna , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down certain control measures in respect of vessels flying the flag of non @-@ Con@@ trac@@ ting Con@@ trac@@ ting Parties to the North @-@ West West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation ( NA@@ F@@ O ) ( COM ( 1999 ) 5@@ 70 - C5 @-@ 0041 0041 / 2000 - 1999 / 02@@ 31 ( CN@@ S ) ) .
Finally , in conclusion , acknowledging our rapporteur for his clear @-@ sightedness sightedness and for his talents as a negotiator , I should like to express my complete agreement with him on the need to remedy the existing legal vacuum to enable these agreements to come into force .
True , we need to implement a genuine policy of cooperation with the countries of origin , which must be based on respect for fundamental rights , but it is also crucial that we open up legal immigration channels at European level , and we await a constructive debate with the Presidency on the definition of the common rights of non @-@ EU EU nationals working legally in Europe .
These negotiations are always difficult .
We owe it to our citizens , and to democracy , to provide a better explanation of what happens in Brussels .
While it is certainly a Presidency of crisis management , it is also a Presidency that must not sacrifice its priorities .
Madam President , a few words on Japan .
These agreements , which are still very rough and ready , nonetheless deserve to be encouraged and , most especially , improved .
Moreover , the situation concerning social services of general interest has still not been cleared up .
Mr President , allow me to take up the various points which have been mentioned during this debate , and to let you know the Commission &amp; apos ; s position .
Madam President , I welcome the work carried out by our rapporteurs .
The Union , sadly , has not protected Europeans from this situation .
It is essential for developing countries to open up their markets and accept a number of rules .
The aim is not to call into question workers &amp; apos ; acquired rights , but to make it possible to protect the existing balances within certain Member States .
The European Union has contributed to financing the deployment of African troops in Burundi , before the African Union subsequently took over , and it is lending its support to the current United Nations mission in the country .
We can support the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s determination to pursue the development of the infrastructure needed by port installations at European level .
The credibility of the European Union is at stake .
Labelling for GMOs and imprisonment for those who oppose GMOs . Therein , in short , lies the ambiguity of these biotechnologies and of the European position .
This is an own @-@ initiative initiative report which calls on the European Commission to clearly identify the shortcomings of the current framework and to provide an impact study outlining the potential different alternatives for improving the system , including new legislation if necessary .
I would first like to thank Mrs Jensen sincerely for her report ; I see that it has earned a great deal of support from the House .
Our ambition for 2006 extends to Europe &amp; quot ; s becoming a more influential global partner .
The agreement that we are discussing is of strategic importance for both parties .
We now need to acquire the instruments to conduct our policy .
For the first time , Israel seems resigned to this solution , which has been demanded time and time again by the Palestinians .
Accep@@ ting a 48 @-@ hour hour working week when 35 hours is being considered in many countries is a major departure and we must not go beyond this .
Mr President , I am grateful to each and every one of you for the quality and the cand@@ our of your speeches .
I welcome the fact that the Commission plans to legislate on concessions , which have been mixed up for too long with public contracts .
Lastly , let us remain consistent : we want a Union that is underpinned by the principle of secularity like a school of democracy and tolerance .
My own services are currently preparing proposals which will be presented to the Council when they are completely ready .
Unfortunately I had no authorisation to check this kind of information for myself .
However , maybe because this is about members of the Commission , that is not the case .
Not only will the European Parliament itself establish its position on the northern half of the Korean peninsula , but it will also have defined the new direction of this position for all the European institutions .
Of necessity , a European referendum , that is to say a consultation organised on the same day in each Member State .
The European Council meeting in Cologne , despite all the efforts of the Presidency @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council - to which I would like to pay particular tribute - still nevertheless raises some major questions .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for allowing me the opportunity to inform Parliament of the recent developments concerning the common agricultural policy .
My second question is to Commissioner Reding .
It is clear from the wording of all these conditions that this is unlikely to take place without a Europe that is more solid , more united and more involved than today &amp; apos ; s Europe .
This is a matter of urgency .
That is what the debate on governance is all about .
Mr President , President of the Commission , the w@@ inds of change seem to be b@@ lowing in this Chamber .
These budget signals illustrate the extent to which our flexibility is limited by the financial perspective and demonstrate , once again , that the environment budget is being wh@@ it@@ tled away .
Mr Prodi , like previous speakers , I must congratulate you , as Mr Lipietz has just done , on your lucidity and your courage , as you have maintained your position .
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission , the Council and all of my fellow Members of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport for the work that has been accomplished .
In addition , the amendment tabled in plenary on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE concerning long @-@ distance distance animal transport should enable the EU to limit the unnecessary suffering of animals intended for slaughter , whilst maintaining excellent sanitary conditions .
I believe that this is the right way to go .
By believing , or appearing to believe , the opposite , the Union is mistaken , and this is point@@ lessly complic@@ ating transatlantic relations .
I welcome Parliament &amp; quot ; s position .
Europe must bring aid to the refugees , offer asylum to those who request it , affirm their right to return , work to reestablish them and ensure their safety by means of a European peace @-@ keeping keeping force . We must also demand substantial autonomy for Kosovo and convene a European conference for peace , security and reconstruction in the Balkans .
At the start , however there was no debate to be had .
Mr President , the Group of the European Radical Alliance to which I belong will probably vote in support of the resolution .
I do not mind a bit of an effort being made to b@@ ail out the con@@ federations of parties , but in the light of the European ideal it is not very fair , not very worthy .
In addition , we would like the Council to follow suit and thus put a definitive end to the three long years that have passed since the Commission , perce@@ iving the breakdown in social dialogue , made very timely use of its right of initiative .
The Union will have to re @-@ engine@@ er engine@@ er this operation , and the foreign affairs ministers will have to debate it at the Council of 10 November .
As a general rule , you will tell me , we have not reached that point .
in writing . - The Services Directive has just been adopted , by a clear majority .
We believe , in fact , that it is essential that the Commission should , within three years , submit a methodology designed in conjunction with the Member States , in order to establish this minimum safety distance .
Basically , we have to undertake , on a worldwide scale , the course of action that enabled us to succeed in Europe when we moved from the Customs Union to the Single Area , and that is why Europe has the most to bring to the negotiations and has the right to expect the most from it .
The Commission believes that this regulation represents a very significant step forwards in achieving greater transparency and accountability on the part of the institutions towards Europe &amp; apos ; s citizens .
Furthermore , one Member of this House applau@@ ded our measures to protect bluefin tuna , and I thank them for that .
Finally , the common fisheries policy must not be confined exclusively to issues under the three headings of monitoring , capacities and technical measures .
Furthermore , the directive on inspection by the port state requires Member S@@ ates to inspect foreign vessels entering their ports in order to check that they are compliant with Community and international legislation on maritime safety , protection of the marine environment and working and living conditions .
The controls have even improved the standards of scientific practices .
Therefore we cannot consider imposing science and technology as a means of development .
Indeed , this united approach must also inspire the European Union and its Member States to respond to the effects of the crisis on economic growth .
But over and above this limited progress , a number of problems , serious problems , remain as far as freedoms are concerned .
Having said that , it is clear that the future of the European transport system necessarily involves revitalising the rail sector and in short order .
It is therefore in this context , which was sket@@ ched out by the Treaty on European Union , the Vienna action plan and the Tampere Summit , that the proposal for a decision we are debating today is enshrined .
National parliaments must put forward proposals and give their opinions , according to each country &amp; apos ; s system , before the final Council in the negotiating mandate they vote to give their governments .
The implementation of this reform clearly reflects the difficulties we are facing , but we know that this exercise , however difficult , is a vital one .
I hope that this will be the line followed by the Luxembourg Presidency at the European Council and within the respective sectoral Councils , and I am sure that your proposals on the main areas of work , namely the Financial Perspectives , the reform of the Stability Pact and the review of the Lisbon process , will be guided by this spirit of sustainable development .
In doing so , we must ensure that environmental policy in Europe is based not on ideology but on the concept of responsibility .
We are in favour of a more prominent role for the Committee of the Regions provided that the interinstitutional balance remains as it is today .
In this respect , we have explored all avenues in order to obtain maximum flexibility and this issue may , if necessary , be re @-@ examined examined when the functioning of the authorities is reviewed , which is scheduled for the end of 2013 .
Therefore , Mr Catania , the amendment that you are tabling is unnecessary .
It is true that we have not discussed voluntary work as much as we should .
Each Member State is fully within its right to establish the provisions governing its own public service .
However , I readily admit that the work has been constructive and that the discussions have taken place regularly , with both the Commission and the Council , to improve the initial proposal .
Also , very recently , the Thessaloniki European Council confirmed that the Union unreservedly supports the International Criminal Court .
The report gives an assessment of how these rights are being implemented .
- Mr President , a rather contradictory approach can be observed today in this House .
There is no difference in the nature of these annexes .
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fat@@ eful year 2008 , by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions .
The point of constructing Europe in the first place was to establish peace , and to cause it to take root , after so many pointless fratri@@ cidal wars ; establishing peace and , consequently , democracy , since they go together .
However , if we look closely at the proposed arrangements , we might have some doubts over the quality of this control .
I therefore think that the approach of the Union institutions must respect two broad principles .
I am just as keen on these issues and thank you for this opportunity .
The report discusses - and , moreover , rightly so - people @-@ to to @-@ people people contacts , and I would ask you what better way of establishing these people @-@ to to @-@ people people contacts is there than by allowing the citizens of these countries to travel freely to the European Union ?
Experience has demonstrated that these measures are wrongly or un@@ equally applied since they are ambiguous or incomplete , or can no longer be applied due to changes in the sector .
We have a Green Paper and we are currently looking for the most effective proposals .
I therefore welcome wholeheartedly the proposal to set up a &amp; apos ; Mil@@ k fund &amp; apos ; and the proposal to evaluate , from 2010 , the raising of milk quotas in accordance with market trends .
To avoid the worst , Europe must urgently introduce a form of common governance of its economic and budgetary policies .
Finally , it is necessary to define agriculture &amp; apos ; s contribution to climate change and sustainable development .
Mr President , I am speaking on a point of procedure motion , Rule 1@@ 26 , a brief point of order , Rule 127 , and place of meeting , Rule 11 of the Rules of Procedure .
The opinions expressed are a useful tool for our negotiations on free trade agreements .
Developing the concept of corporate social responsibility is the other interesting aspect of the report because , although it is currently a useful concept , it is still based on voluntary participation and therefore has room for improvement .
As you know , the role of the European Union is viewed much more favourably by third countries than from within the Member States themselves .
In other areas , our attitudes differ .
They are important for consumers because they offer better services at fairer prices .
When we are told that the disabled access is not suitable for visitors , well , perhaps someone should have thought of that before .
The second paragraph of the same article says the Union shall respect fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and , as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States , as general principles of Community law .
It is the Member States themselves perhaps , but it is also the recognition of the university community as a whole which , at a European level , authenti@@ c@@ ates it through exchange and cooperation mechanisms .
An amendment has been tabled to this effect .
At present , I should like to thank Mr Mitchell for his report and the work he has done in this regard within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
We cannot , therefore , endorse any draft which does not go through the procedure of a directive discussed in this House .
On the European scale , many decisions place the whole body of immigrants under suspicion and attempt to destabilise their position .
Let us first turn our attention to our own policy .
We have now come to the final stage for a new framework regulation , further evidence of better regulation .
We shall then be able to determine the various views on this matter .
I quite understand the concerns expressed in the draft opinion of Parliament ; that is why the Commission will amend its proposal as far as possible in order to respond to this opinion of Parliament .
The principle of transparency of revenue and investment is also on the record which , we hope , will be a precedent in assessing public policies : indeed , Member States will have to report to the Commission on a regular basis .
Allow me to add two further subjects which we could include , namely freedom of expression , because it is an essential catalyst in the development of human rights , and slavery in all its forms .
That is why I am voting in favour of this report .
That is what we should work on .
Nevertheless , I noted that , as in the communication from the Commission , there was something singularly missing from his presentation and I would now like to ask the Commission President quite specifically about this .
Mr President , there are , in my view , three essential points in this debate .
I would also ask that , until we are able to vote again on Mr Barroso , we abide by the rules to the very end .
The Commission and Parliament would be better advised to explore ways by which Turkey can be associated with the EU rather than directly integrated into it .
Obviously , we still need to ensure - and this requires a combined effort - that the directive is revised quickly and effectively .
The problem is the legal force that these political commitments will have , because Ireland has a Constitutional Court , and there is no doubt that the &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; campaign - as is their right - will go to the Irish Constitutional Court to ask what force these political commitments have .
By way of conclusion , I would like to reiterate my support for the committee &amp; apos ; s proposals , my total support for our rapporteur , my personal commitment in these areas , not to mention the commitment of my group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , and I invite the Commission , and above all the Council , to step up Europe &amp; apos ; s commitment if we are to avoid a situation in which far from improving , the developing countries &amp; apos ; position deterior@@ ates in future .
in writing . - While gender equality has been an integral part of the European Union &amp; apos ; s development cooperation programmes for many years now , actual progress is still too slow .
Sub@@ si@@ dies , which in any case give rise to corruption , must be hal@@ ted . The two international bodies - the United Nations and Europe - and , of course , a third body - the Organisation for African Unity - need to tackle this problem without delay .
The solution is a European debt compensation fund for fishermen to ensure that they do not have to put up with the inequality in relation to public burdens , generated by the import policy and the domination of the distribution giants .
We wished to call upon the constituent bodies of the European Union and the EIB itself to reori@@ ent its policy in the light of these three objectives which were perhaps not as clear at the time when the EIB adopted its priorities or drew up its 1999 report .
European Union legislation and , more specifically , the Asylum Quali@@ fication Directive , states that the Member States must respect the principle of non @-@ refoulement refoulement , in accordance with their international obligations .
We need to be aware that quality and recognition bring hope for the future of Europe &amp; quot ; s farming .
He appears before us today with a compromise that manages to take account of Members &amp; quot ; positions : it is a responsible stance .
M@@ ain@@ stre@@ aming is implemented through a Community framework strategy for equality between women and men .
This means that the first implementing regulation should be adopted during the next few months .
At the same time , I believe it would be useful to explore in greater depth , and in the light of different national experiences , the advantages and the limitations of such arrangements .
My custom is to end on an optimistic note .
The next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolution on Nigeria , and more specifically the case of Mrs Amina Lawal :
However , it is just as vital to ensure that these provisions do not jeopardise citizens &amp; apos ; fundamental freedoms or result in some people being discriminated against because of their origin or religion .
Today , the 24 October 2000 , in Strasbourg , the European Parliament is stating one simple message loudly and clearly : the European Constitution is something you can achieve and something that we indeed want .
Well I would like to say that there is no room for subsidiarity in matters of human rights either .
I wish to say again in this House that I have nothing but praise for the loyalty and cooperation demonstrated by Mr Poettering in the Conference of Presidents , where we have sat together for seven and a half years .
Additionally , a strategic dialogue on Asia has begun .
I thus think that the method chosen is the right one .
I believe nevertheless that we should pursue our efforts in two directions .
It was just that I was told confirmation was required from the House .
We are thus relying on you .
I wish to explain why I am abstaining on this text , as I do whenever a report concerning accession negotiations with a European country is voted on here .
However , to create a barrier @-@ free free Europe for disabled people , to enable them to lead a life and have a career as everyone else does not just require good intentions ; it also requires resources .
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union .
The next item is the statements of the Council and the Commission on the rising food prices in the EU and developing countries .
Under those circumstances , the Americans need to shoulder their responsibilities and accept the consequences with us , but I do not see how we , on our own , could have told them to put a stop to this strategy .
In any case , that is what the Commission can do and what I personally will try to do .
It is also important that the EU institutions and the Member States renew their efforts on awareness @-@ raising raising , to ensure that citizens are aware of these fundamental rights , thus ensuring that these rights are better protected .
The negotiations were dreadful , and to my mind , this vote is a decision imposed as a result of the power play within Parliament and the Council .
The rapporteur knows this .
We need to explain this issue clearly to citizens and , with this in mind , we urge the Irish Presidency to start doing this , to publicly and accurately set out the IGC &amp; quot ; s points of agreement and disagreement .
We need to bring people together , and we shall do so together , here in Parliament , with the Commission , the national parliaments and all those responsible in each Member State for sharing , evaluating and exchanging good practices .
This concession to our views is welcome .
This net@@ worked coordination is more decentralised and flexible and more liberal than the standard harmonisation directive .
Therefore , this is a huge problem and the European Commission must properly address this issue .
Allow me to give a few pertinent examples .
Have any deadlines been set to enable all Europeans to read all of the plans made by each country , as well as the concrete guidelines that should be laid down everywhere ?
They cannot under any circumstances be treated less favourably than the other citizens of the Union , and the Commission will ensure that their rights are respected .
In addition , I must congratulate the European Parliament , Madam President , on having provided EUR 1 million for all our victim support programmes .
This report was adopted within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs after several months of discussion , since the Commission proposal was referred to us on 28 September 2006 , as is written down .
It is this very agenda that was proposed by the Commission on 2 June , supported by the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg a few days ago , and supported too , I hope , and as President Barroso wants , by the European Council . Moreover , ladies and gentlemen , you can count on me and on us to make proposals to you , one by one , step by step , between now and the start of next year , on all the undertakings we have made , so that we may learn , at European level and in good cooperation with the other regions of the world and , in particular , with the United States , every single lesson from this crisis affecting citizens , consumers and businesses .
I now wish to say a few words about the new instruments established by the Treaty of Amsterdam and about interinstitutional relations , which are both subjects on which , I noted , your reports expressed some concern .
I also think it is important to highlight the need for a strong EU common position on the follow @-@ up up to the fact @-@ finding finding mission on the conflict in Gaza and Southern Israel ; it is imperative , in this regard , that the recommendations included in the Goldstone report be implemented .
You are avoiding giving the annual figure , which would represent 0.@@ 0 something percent , a tiny fraction of the European budget .
Madam President , the report by our colleague Ria Oomen @-@ Ruijten Ruijten is thorough , honest and courageous at a very testing time for Turkey , and I wish to congratulate her on this .
Where Kosovo is concerned , the prospect of joining the European Union is a powerful catalyst for the implementation of necessary reforms , notably the reforms pertaining to human rights , which have already been brought up and which we need to encourage .
It is obvious , of course , that we must achieve optimum equilibrium between fleet size and fisheries resources , but it must not be achieved at any price , and certainly not at the expense of the men and women who earn their live@@ li@@ hoods from fishing and who keep fishing alive .
The equilibrium of SMEs could be seriously destabi@@ lized by the introduction of the euro , and clearly that is very worrying since this category of enterprises provides about two @-@ thirds thirds of the jobs in our countries .
We hear talk of the problem of the statute for Members , and of inequality , but the Member States are responsible for the situation of their Members .
However , the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals do not set a deadline for this to be achieved .
The second point is that of credibility .
You are probably the prime minister we need at this time .
Let us take advantage of this situation , however , to contain the problem and avoid making war .
Promoting cultural diversity and European values of tolerance also means standing in the way of incitement to hatred , whatever the means used to spread it : satellite television or the Internet .
It is vital that we create the conditions for balanced economic , social and territorial development on both sides of borders and pay special attention to programmes aimed at achieving cross @-@ border border cooperation .
First of all , Europe is concerned because the Union must not simply be a stepping stone of liberal globalisation , but also an area of freedom in which the citizens have the rights guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights and , more recently , the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Today , V@@ áclav Klaus , President of the Czech Republic , is the only person left to try to resist this liberti@@ cidal text that is the Treaty of Lisbon .
In particular , we must reconcile the major opening up of the European market , importing 60 % of consumption , with the need to protect our fishermen , who see the Japanese , American and Korean markets closing .
Political foundations , as well as national parliaments - an element introduced by our Parliament - are explicitly en@@ u@@ mer@@ ated among the bodies that are eligible for support .
Responsibility for implementing these requirements will very largely rest with the Member States .
In order to ensure that the area of freedom , security and justice becomes a reality , we must think European before we think national .
I want to emphasise the importance of the objective of promoting multilingualism in digital content on the world networks , particularly for European languages .
That being said , I would ask you , Mr President , to ask the Member of whom I was speaking to apologise .
It is then that the Commission will assess the situation in Macedonia , in light of this report and the criteria of recital 5 .
Mr President , closer cooperation between Member States is a means of European integration which must allow the obstacles to be overcome ; obstacles which are due partly to the often divergent expectations of Member States and partly to the continuation of the rule of unanimity by the Amsterdam Treaty , .
rapporteur on behalf of the opinion of the Committee on Women &amp; apos ; s Rights and Gender Equality . - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament has always been committed to setting up a common asylum system by 2010 .
Thank you for clarifying that matter , but we are still rather dist@@ ressed at the statement you have just made because we were under the impression that the previous Commission was working on the simple principle of &amp; apos ; no lists , no funds &amp; apos ; .
It is essential that , in Member States and in any cooperation between them , the basic principles of human dignity regain a central place , and are promoted and defended by policies to protect victims and prosecute those responsible .
Madam President , I share the honourable Members &amp; apos ; intense disappointment at the outcome of the Conference in The Hague , which is effectively an outright failure .
It is not , for us , about power but about contributing to a crucial debate on the future of European construction .
The European Union is , moreover , already active in these fields .
Agreement on one of the five proposals , the regulation on the CO2 emissions of cars , was reached this week .
As far as regulation is concerned , it is not up to Europe to make the rules .
I have just listened to Mr Busuttil and it is true that , faced with the influx of immigrants and asylum seekers , Member States like Malta find themselves in extremely difficult situations .
Furthermore , we believe that the decision @-@ making making procedures and the composition of the governing body of the International Monetary Fund should be substantially reviewed .
Mr President , as shadow rapporteur for my group , I , too , would like to thank the rapporteur for the conditions in which we were able to work with him on this matter .
Because if the euro is successful , and nobody doubts , not now in any case , that it will be established , perhaps we should think about accelerating the processes , and particularly , because the material difficulties seem increasingly obvious , about reducing the period 1999 @-@ 2002 2002 , that is , the wait for the euro in everyday life .
leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus . Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall speak in my mother tongue because I would like to say what I think , and I always think in Belarusian .
To some extent , this observation is based on the report that the anti @-@ terrorist terrorist monitoring group formed by the UN sent to the Security Council today .
No , we are cutting fishing opportunities because the European fishing fleet has utilised less in the areas concerned .
On this last point , we could present the findings of the task force at the November summit , once they have been adopted by the European Council .
The Swedish Presidency submitted a draft resolution on behalf of the European Union at this session .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for this opportunity to debate before the Commission deliber@@ ates on these proposals .
In this respect , European innovation policy should ensure that those who innovate , including small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises , receive appropriate support at regional level too .
We need to make sure that our fellow citizens maintain confidence in the banking system and do not give in to this tide of panic , which would only precip@@ itate a downward spiral .
That seems to me to be , over and above the necessary conditionality , the future of our national cooperation policies , and I believe that the Commission would earn much credit by submitting a proposal for the gradual communitiz@@ ation of the resources of national development policies .
The first report is being finalised as we speak .
Is to negotiate in this manner not to offer de facto recognition of the legitimacy of extraterritorial laws ?
In fact , naturalisation policy falls within the competence of the Member States .
Mr President , I would like to make some additional remarks regarding the humanitarian resolution that we have signed .
We are sensitive to the suffering that this war is inf@@ licting on the population and hope , therefore , that this objective is achieved as quickly as possible .
Besides the economic and financial role that farmers play , they also have a social , cultural and environmental role that must be given top priority .
The chapter on private life appears to be the high point of a constitution that is based , as we have noted , exclusively on Christian religious references and traditional family values .
In the final analysis there could be a move away , not just from the text of the Convention , but also from the Treaty of Nice , as regards qualified majority voting , the powers of Parliament on budgetary matters or the introduction of a threshold of 66 % of the population as the definition of a qualified majority .
So , the objective of social protection which the European legislator has set itself will not be achieved .
As far as we are concerned , you have the right to represent all the peoples of Europe , I know this and I respect it .
We are to move forward to a better organized and better planned stage of cooperation , arranging for the PHARE and TACIS programmes , the EBRD appropriations , etc . , to be combined within a global plan , a plan for which we have been hoping for several years now , the preparation of which is now becoming - to adopt a term with which you are familiar , Madam President - a burning obligation .
No , you are not going to trap me .
This policy must reflect the Union &amp; apos ; s fundamental values and objectives .
This is reflected in all the European press .
In that way you will provide us with the means to work with you effectively and we will all gain from our differences .
To conclude : the Council invites the Commission to view the first forum on the future demographics of Europe , which took place in Brussels on 30 and 31 October , as a starting point for a structured and lasting dialogue , within and between Member States , and to act so that the Commission may provide support to the relevant bodies to find the best strategies for responding to this demographic change .
The Convention will be nothing more than a sham if it pursues the same objective without acknowledging that the Treaty of Nice is dead and bu@@ ried .
a high level of protection for passengers , in line with that for other modes of transport ;
Pirker report ( A5 @-@ 03@@ 05 03@@ 05 / 2001 )
We must also raise the issue , as you did , Commissioner , of drugs in the country .
Then , of course , we need to intervene in the Member States when necessary .
It is essential for this freedom to be maintained and guaranteed .
The report under examination was an opportunity to send a reminder , and it is regrettable that it has not done so .
The main losers of this suspension of the round of negotiations will be developing countries , and , of those , the least advanced countries in particular .
While desirable in itself , a constitution of this kind could only be adopted as the crow@@ ning touch to far @-@ reaching reaching institutional reform .
Even though , in Copenhagen , poor countries require real commitments concerning long @-@ term term financing , the Council has only managed to pledge EUR 7.@@ 2 billion over three years .
Indeed , we consider that whereas it may be useful to provide an overall legal framework to these investments , the text of the agreement should establish , in its first article , the inalienable sovereignty of a people and their right to choose the laws and the type of society that suits them .
If we want to be credible , we must act quickly and put an end to sterile political diatri@@ bes .
The Directive on the posting of workers has been poorly applied in the Member States and is not meeting its objectives .
I also want to put them on their guard about the fact that the application of a complete regulation is being delayed even further , with the risk that the European Union - a pioneer in this field - might have only have to meet the general standards of the co@@ de@@ x alim@@ ent@@ ari@@ us , its text being currently under discussion , with all that that also involves in terms of the actual nature of imports from third countries .
The Commission is responsible for proposing legislative and budget proposals , and the two branches of the legislative and budgetary authority are responsible for deciding on these .
We cannot build transatlantic relations just by repeating over and over again that that is what we want .
In any case , whatever its final form , the national parliaments should not have been sidelined .
We are now confronted with a framework agreement concluded by some of the social partners - SMEs are not represented - on part @-@ time time work , an agreement that I would qualify as &amp; quot ; watered down &amp; apos ; in comparison with the initial proposal for a directive and even in comparison with the amended version of 198@@ 3 .
That is why we repeat the same slogans as my anc@@ estors who rose up against ty@@ ran@@ ny for the sake of freedom : &amp; apos ; For your freedom and for ours . &amp; apos ;
Mr President , as far as the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is concerned , cohesion policy is at the heart of one of the most fundamental policies of the European Union : solidarity .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , even though many advances have been made in comparison with the initial text presented by the European Commission , the directive on services in the internal market that has been submitted to the vote today differs from the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s first reading .
On the contrary , we are willing to try to reach a kind of gentlemen &amp; apos ; s agreement , through genuine dialogue , that would give each of our institutions the safeguards and guarantees it believes necessary .
By contrast with the &amp; apos ; Blue Card &amp; apos ; Directive , this directive does not concern the admission criteria for third @-@ country country workers . It is aimed at eliminating the variations between differing national legislation concerning the application procedures for work permits and residence permits , and the rights of foreigners working legally in the European Union .
It welcomes negotiations on the EU @-@ Libya Libya Framework Agreement with a view to eventually bringing Libya into the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean Free Trade Area ( EM@@ F@@ TA ) that eurocracy has been preparing for the past 15 years .
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring , once the decision has been taken , that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible .
In general , the report seeks to support the compromise struck in the Council - acting , as you said , under the constraint of unanimity - despite the text &amp; apos ; s serious shortcomings , the Council of Ministers not having in fact taken on board the proposals made in the Cox report in 1999 .
In the meantime , this new proposal for a regulation is , to my mind , a step towards achieving greater transparency .
Although we are in favour of European integration that is open to all countries , current debate on enlargement analyses areas that we would prefer to avoid .
Within the Schengen area , it is now possible to move freely without border controls .
It has not been straightforward for two reasons .
In the Middle East , a constant source of tension , the issue has to be resolved by the establishment of two sovereign states - Israel and Palestine - with absolute security guarantees for both .
These serious flaws on key points are the reason for our opposition .
This being so , and even if this may seem very optimistic and even paradoxical , the enlargement of the European Union could favour the emergence of a true common foreign and defence policy and a true European identity .
It is really considerable .
In fact , the Commission programme recommends a revision of the strategy to achieve the EU &amp; quot ; s objectives in the form of a new negotiating position .
rapporteur . - Madam President , let us try to be precise .
I hope that it will listen to our arguments today , for this system proposed by the Commission , this tariff preference , even if it were to amount to EUR 300 , is in danger of proving completely useless in practice , for the ACP producers will be wi@@ ped out by the so @-@ called called &amp; apos ; first come , first served &amp; apos ; system .
It is also in the interests of the major users , who will buy sugar a great deal cheaper on the world market without this being reflected in the price of the end product , thereby maxim@@ ising their profits .
This agreement would not have been possible without Parliament and the Council &amp; apos ; s willingness to compromise .
So we shall be submitting a revised proposal within the next few weeks , as instruc@@ ted by the Laeken European Council .
Any committee set up by the Commission must remain autonomous and independent if it is to play its full role , which is that of providing expert advice .
Madam President , I think you need to repeat the vote on Amendment 1 , because there was the same majority that voted in favour of Amendment 1 .
It works in particular on achievement of the Millennium Goals set in the United Nations in 2000 .
Our temporary committee was right to recommend emergency vaccination as the best way to combat the epidemic , since this avoids the mass slaughter which , understandably , caused such great public outcry and was so distressing for farmers .
Will we one day stop using more and more pesticides , which are particularly harmful to the environment , to nature and also to health ?
We are therefore in full agreement with the relevant conclusions of Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath Plath &amp; apos ; s report recommending the approval of these six candidates .
This summit was important because the Roma issue is of common interest to Europeans and calls for a proactive policy - one that is of course adapted to specific national conditions - to be conducted by each Member State .
Furthermore , the clauses of the contracts between the Commission and the national agencies have been clarified and simplified .
The third challenge consists of making a distinction , irrespective of the circumstances , between the Palestinian Government , which will have to face up to its responsibilities , and the Palestinian people , which cannot be taken hostage on account of the choice it has made .
More recently , on the subject of the elections , the European Union issued a declaration , the principal elements of which are as follows . The European Union reminded Moldova that its relations with the EU would depend on its commitment to common values .
You told us that the Commission was active in meeting the operating costs of NGOs , but what we Members of Parliament want is to ensure that all NGOs , may be supported and funded on the basis of a number of practical projects .
I think that needs pointing out . Perhaps it will help us think about how to achieve the political and cultural integration of Europe , given that research is an element of this integration .
Mr President , I am certainly not going to talk about the content , but I would nonetheless like to clarify two or three facts .
But if we do not move in the direction of democratic dialogue with a special European envoy , we will come to grief .
In Lisbon , the European Council in fact asked the EIB to make a contribution to funding in a number of areas that were considered absolute priorities for that strategy .
Fish@@ er@@ men have made considerable efforts in recent years , keeping to increasingly restrictive quotas , modernising their fleets and so on .
On this last point , the Commission states that large amounts of public money are available to SMEs , particularly in the context of regional funds and certain Community initiative programmes .
He said that he , personally , could certainly subscribe to the Commission &amp; quot ; s initial proposal .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to congratulate Mr Martin on this excellent report , prepared in conjunction with professional fish farmers .
It is hear@@ tening that the Baltic Sea summit should provide a forum where these countries can forget their differences in order to launch new initiatives for working together .
Its scope cannot be reduced to a simple market @-@ harmonisation harmonisation or competitiveness problem .
Moreover , the wording leaves several loopholes for those Member States who like the rules to be applied more restric@@ tively , which limits the actual scope of measures which are a step in the right direction .
I therefore invite you all to vote in favour of postponing the vote on this report and the one that follows five items later .
We also felt that the convergence process should be a mutual process .
The Council decided to hold an annual debate on these issues and the first such debate will take place after the January or February session . We will then assess the issue of when these new measures are to be first implemented .
Madam President , on Monday evening we were gratified at the visit by the Minister , Mr Jouyet , and the importance that the French Presidency appeared to attach to the work of this Parliament .
Fin@@ ishing with the general aspects , I would also like to say that I know how much Parliament would like to be kept informed about the implementation of this programme and that the Commission will ensure that it supplies Parliament with regular detailed information on this matter .
The limited steps that the Turkish Government has resolved to take in this area and the practical difficulties in implementing them rule out the possibility that Turkey will meet the conditions - which , moreover , are inadequate - for accession to the European Union .
This remarkable progress should not , however , make us lose sight of a major imperative : safety .
Madam President , I should like to declare myself in favour of Mr Poettering &amp; apos ; s proposal .
In spite of this , there are two observations I believe are worth making .
This will be achieved through the political and budgetary transparency of this objective .
This is about restoring a fair balance between aspects that we will have to realise in practice .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that Mr Dehaene &amp; apos ; s report , which is very important and very valuable , should be supplemented as regards the operation and , above all , the responsibilities of the European Council .
I welcome the adoption of this regulation by a very large majority - by 5@@ 62 votes to 29 , with 51 abstentions .
This development must give you the possibility of demanding transparency and handling of the various forms of export aid used by our competitors .
You have one minute to set out your argument and then we shall vote .
I therefore hope that a United Nations commission of enquiry may be set up as quickly as possible and I ask the President of Parliament , the Commission and the Council to work together to ensure that a request to this effect is forwarded to the Secretary @-@ General General of the United Nations .
I should like to ask one simple question .
I should also like to say a few words about the manner in which the measures are to be taken , specifically those concerning market management .
The problem is that this report , in its current form , seems to have several objectives .
S@@ pre@@ ading peace is an o@@ ft @-@ repeated repeated desire but one that , very often , is hindered along the way by the reality of hatred and intolerance .
I should note , moreover , that such products are no more expensive in the European Union than they are in other countries .
Mr President , on behalf of the Democrats and Liberals in this House , let me say to the signatories of this motion of censure that they are being ridiculous .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work , which meets the expectations of the representatives of the European Union &amp; apos ; s outermost regions .
European integration is a way of helping one another to comply with these requirements and to preserve our special qualities in an exciting and dangerous world .
I also thank the Council , because the Council has listened to us very attentively and I also thank those fellow Members who have spoken this evening .
If we want a more modern and more democratic Europe , then we need a strong strategy to combat violence against women .
Mrs Győri , ladies and gentlemen , in the context of the humanitarian crisis in Libya , today more than ever , it is fundamental that Europe provides itself with the means of concerted action in respect of resettlement .
Through this legal decision , a portion of the penal law of the Member States has just been brought within the competence of the Community and has been so without the formal agreement of the nations .
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific &amp; apos ; nuclear research &amp; apos ; context .
This applies to the euro , which has been a success , and also , on a broader level , to our work as lawmakers .
You are aware of this , Mr Prodi .
I have thus voted against this proposal being passed on to the Council .
These staff carry out an important economic task under difficult conditions , while still ensuring safety .
We still have everything to do .
I believe that the European Union must take steps in order to eliminate these two elements and therefore destroy the root cause of this evil .
These requirements are clear : inform Parliament of the results of the OLAF inquiry ; publish the list of members of the Governing Board ; provide a final external audit@@ or &amp; apos ; s report on the appropriations used to finance private expenditure ; and ensure that changes are made within the Governing Board in order to avoid a repeat of this situation in the future .
The Union &amp; apos ; s foreign policy in this particularly troubled region of the globe must no longer be limited to simply being the principal donor of economic and financial aid in the form of the vast sums made available to the Palestinian population .
Yet , there is nothing in the proposal for a directive which convin@@ ces us that releasing GMOs and , more importantly , placing GMOs on the market , will be subject to strict monitoring , leading to an outright ban if this were shown to be in the interests of society , even if this means a clash with the interests of the agricultural food corporations .
I should like sincerely to congratulate all the MEPs who have just been elected .
We can try to reform the United Nations , but it would be better to start by reforming ourselves .
In my view the first demonstration of this should be the Commission and the Council genuinely taking into account the recommendations contained in this report .
Furthermore , I wish to answer , of course , those who asked me about the proposal .
Firstly , there is the adoption of a set of integrated guidelines making it possible to synchron@@ ise and rationalise the various processes which exist at present .
Let us bear in mind that Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis ( data protection , Schengen Information System , air , land and sea borders , police cooperation and visas ) when they joined the European Union in 2007 . Now , however , all Member States need to agree on their effective participation in the area without internal borders .
We added to them .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am , of course , in agreement with the report by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm , because coordination of economic policies represents a crucial issue for monetary union .
We are sure that the European Parliament will have a contribution , a very important contribution , to make to this debate and we , the European Commission , want to work with you because we think it is necessary to build a new consensus in Europe .
But then what ?
I think that new European legislative texts need to be more effective in forcing companies established in the Union to take on their responsibilities .
We need public funding that is sufficient to meet these needs .
Our second point of contention relates to the role played by the Committee on Budgetary Control , which is in the process of losing the option it has had until now of giving its opinion on the amendments before they are put to the vote in the House .
But in any case it is an area which manifestly relates to health , to the demographic phenomenon of the ageing of the population , and also to prevention .
As we are opposed to any direct or indirect subsidy seeking to use public money to generate private profit , we voted against this report .
That is why I have tabled an amendment which I would ask you to support , calling for these rights to be re @-@ established established as quickly as possible .
I believe we will come to regret this .
We also propose greater flexibility concerning the student residence permit .
The joint resolution from the European Parliament on organic livestock production questions the Commission and the Council on the technical progress needed to fulfil the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal that is currently being examined . As regards the fundamental issue of animal nutrition , the derogation in this proposal that allows 10 % conventional feed to be used is quite sufficient .
I want to keep open lines with Parliament on these questions .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , please forgive me , but I am going to have to destroy the wonderful unanimity which is prevailing in this Chamber .
These agreements represent a first step in the process of strengthening relations between the European Union and Georgia .
Up until now , however , only three Member States have said they are willing to reach an agreement with us in order to develop the campaign on the future of Europe .
Tomorrow we shall no doubt have to develop and complete it .
In its resolution , our Parliament says that we are giving up EUR 20 million .
In this regard , Iran &amp; apos ; s nuclear dossier is part of a complex process that touches on security in the Middle East and the Muslim world .
I would like to end by emphasising the importance of dialogue with the Council .
I have made every effort to bring it forward and put it back on the Council &amp; quot ; s agenda , but , as with the other matters I have addressed today , there is a need to strike a balance between interests that sometimes conflict .
This report raises the fundamental questions underlying the partnership and gives pertinent answers which I support , in particular the need to stress the political dimension of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean partnership in order to foster democratisation and peace , support for Mediterranean civil societies , the systematic inclusion of the human rights issue in follow @-@ up up , and the establishment of a genuine Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean parliamentary assembly at the next Euro@@ M@@ ed ministerial conference in Naples in December 2003 .
By voting today , Thursday , 7 October 2010 on a resolution , the European Parliament is demanding that the Commission give thought to significantly improving cohesion policy instruments .
From this point of view , the draft budget for the year 2000 gives rise to serious concern .
We fully support Mr Bontempi &amp; apos ; s report dealing with the judicial network in Europe .
We have only two serious budgetary policies : agricultural policy and regional policy .
Because these evils are linked : our 18 million unemployed , the 50 million citizens of the Union aff@@ licted by poverty and exclusion , and the difficulties experienced by the developing countries .
- Before the vote on Amendment 9@@ 96
Nonetheless , we must be aware that these proposals which , as highlighted by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , are essentially a response to the legal requirements which have been identified in the areas defined by their respective objectives will only be effective insofar as they are correctly implemented by the Member States and monitored by the Commission .
Therefore , we shall include what Mrs Flautre said , and I shall now record this paragraph as having been orally amended .
This is quite simply unacceptable .
Of course , we must ratify this agreement .
Of course , you are entirely correct in saying that competition in the area of taxation , which currently occurs between Member States , reduces the tax base , creates problems of tax receipts for Member States and leads to fiscal dumping .
This will be the first time that the preparations for the summits with the Union &amp; apos ; s key partners have been discussed by Heads of State or Government , in line with the conclusions of the European Council of 16 September .
And that issue is not purely technical or economic , but political in the strongest sense of the word .
The situation of women &amp; apos ; s rights , in fact , and their place within rural society require substantially more determination by the Member States and the Commission .
I do not want a Europe that is reduced to being a mere free @-@ trade trade area cop@@ ied from the An@@ glo @-@ Saxon Saxon model , but rather a Europe founded on the values of solidarity and of sharing among nations , something that has always been the vehicle for European progress .
Recital A of his motion for a resolution stresses that &amp; apos ; the EU ... and European enterprises ... can play a decisive role in global sustainable social and economic development &amp; apos ; .
Our Parliament must obtain , as in any democracy worthy of the name , full budgetary authority over expenditure as well as over revenue .
Moreover , this type of agreement will encourage Georgia to implement the reforms required in the areas of freedom , security and justice , such as the fight against illegal immigration , the strengthening of democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
We voted against this report firstly because it lacks a purpose : the Treaty of Lisbon does not exist ; it was rejected by three referendums .
I would remind you that the summary will be instrumental in safeguarding proper and fair protection for private individuals .
It is this other Europe that we set out at the European Social Democratic Forum in Paris .
These are the real issues the Member States must debate because they lie at the very heart of the process of strengthening budgetary coordination .
We want these objectives to take particular account of circumstances in the new Member States , which will receive funds but will also need to be in a position to use those funds wisely .
After lengthy negotiations , we have managed to reach an agreement that satisfies Parliament .
The Romanian Senate has conducted an investigation , which should be supplemented in order to take account of the Council of Europe &amp; apos ; s second report .
What also appears fundamental to me are the additional guarantees that we are obtaining in terms of obligations to inform Parliament : we will have better access to confidential documents relating to international agreements and negotiations .
It suggests that Turkey should henceforth be fully involved in the Union &amp; apos ; s foreign security and defence policy .
This document reflects our group &amp; apos ; s main concerns about the future of the ACP @-@ EU EU link .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 9 June , at 12 : 00 .
Well , fair enough !
Due to the specific nature of their situation , their integration is a challenge of major proportions with regard to protecting fundamental rights and social inclusion .
The Ayala Sender report is a new tool with which to persecu@@ te motor@@ ists : cross @-@ border border prosecution of serious offences ( but , stran@@ gely , not driving under the influence of drugs ) , Brussels imposing on national authorities how many annual checks to carry out and where to do them , harmonisation of penalties , random means of recourse , information and access to said recourse not being guaranteed to be in the language of the person being prosecuted , possibilities of extending the scope of the directive to other offences ( perhaps over@@ staying at par@@ king met@@ ers ? ) , and so on .
It is my support for substantial European commitment in the Mediterranean region that prompts me to warn against the risks of diluting Europe &amp; apos ; s Mediterranean policy within its overall neighbourhood policy .
As far as I am concerned , I do not think we should run after a moving target .
An in @-@ depth depth reform of the common agricultural policy is therefore what we should now be carrying out , and not just a technical adaptation of the current instruments , which is what you are proposing today .
I ask for it to be recorded in the Minutes that I did not take part in the vote .
These are also some of the issues that we have to tackle .
And yet , at the same time , we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atro@@ cious forms of arms such as anti @-@ personnel personnel mines .
Is it in the interests of society as a whole , and is it in the interests of animal welfare ?
Their skills and knowledge are valuable . The European Union can and must show that it intends to involve them in the development of the rail system .
When will the European Council have such a burst of lucidity ?
That is why I do not want to see revolutionary ferv@@ our bur@@ sting forth from your Assembly but , rather , the momentum of a strong desire and a very great aspiration on the part of the peoples of Europe to make progress along the EU road .
For example , in order to prevent international crime , it would be preferable for the candidate countries of eastern Europe to be able to join Europol now .
If , as I fervently hope , all twenty @-@ five five EU countries ratify the Constitution over the coming months , this twice @-@ yearly yearly examination of the Union &amp; quot ; s priorities will be abandoned in favour of a system of presidencies lasting two and a half years , which will be more stable and therefore more effective .
However , with regard to this motion for a resolution , I would also like to add a few points .
Mr President , I would ask you to consult our colleagues because I feel that the groups must be allowed to vote on this in the same way as you put to the vote the possible referral of the report back to committee due to the inadmissibility of the matter .
I also extend my congratulations to my colleague Mrs Barthet @-@ Mayer Mayer for the effort that has gone into her numerous amendments .
With regard to the Court of Auditors &amp; apos ; comments on the expenditure of the political groups , the resolution seems to be heading in the right direction by inviting the Parliament &amp; apos ; s Bureau and Secretary @-@ General General to achieve complete transparency in the use of appropriations .
I would first of all like to refer to the conclusions passed by the Ecofin Council .
Parliament is ready to play its full role , its full positive and constructive role , to help you realise this ambition , which is a common ambition .
Despite the procedural precautions and despite the undeniable elo@@ quence of our Commissioner and our rapporteurs , we believe that these proposals run counter to the need to save energy and , therefore , to environmental protection .
We are also asking the Commission to carry out a specific assessment and to work on an action plan , in collaboration with the Member States , for improving security standards on existing ri@@ gs .
For us , this report is important because it draws conclusions from one of the few positive outcomes of the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon , if it is effectively implemented .
I ask that my proposal be put to the vote .
Ac@@ count must be taken of the need to guarantee security of supply and the volume of investment this entails .
I would remind you that the Council postponed its review of this dossier until it had heard Parliament &amp; apos ; s views .
L@@ oy@@ al cooperation between the institutions is at stake , as laid down in the Treaty and recognised by the Court .
We also need binding rules to combat this problem .
The way to make progress in this area is to enhance their skills , for example , by chann@@ elling EU funds more effectively towards policies for young people .
We have a specific research and evaluation programme on respect for fundamental rights of the European Union , so that the Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes an operational reality and not just a reality in words alone .
In order to succeed , we should take a credible stance .
Everything that I have just said , ladies and gentlemen , demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account .
I call for the rapid establishment of a European civil protection force as devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 with the aim of arriving at a European response that is planned , genuinely coordinated and effective .
I am grateful to them , and particularly to Mrs Barsi @-@ Pataky Pataky , for the close attention they have paid to the development of this great Galileo programme .
The European Commission has made us proposals with regard to this second phase of Galileo .
All we can do is assist them with our know @-@ how how , our expertise and our political will .
For the first time it lays down in the Treaties the objective of integration , applying it not only at Community level but also , and there is nothing to stop this ideology , at intergovernmental level too .
This text reminds us of that responsibility and under no circumstances can states use this directive as a means of ev@@ ading those responsibilities .
The result on a common foreign and security policy is quite different - something else seen by citizens as a manifestation of Europe &amp; apos ; s existence .
The efficient and smooth functioning of economic adjustments within the euro area requires the removal of institutional barriers to flexible wag@@ e@@ - and price @-@ setting setting mechanisms as well as the completion of the Single Market and thus greater cross @-@ border border competition .
Mr President , I am glad you were able to find a way of resuming our sitting on a dignified basis , something we all want because we are anxious to vote on this motion .
The mandate for the third UN conference covers , in particular , public development aid , debt and trade .
Our Member States still need to show the full solidarity and the determination necessary to implement this strategy .
I think we should be able to vote broadly in favour of his report the day after tomorrow .
Europe still needs to prove itself on all these points which , in fact , form a whole .
In the face of opposition from a large majority of Europeans , what are you doing , Mr Barroso ?
The European Union was built up over time and through various trials .
We need to show that we are logical , fair , flexible and that we know where European interests lie .
If we want to actually overcome the deadlock on qualified majority in order to enable the European Union to accommodate new members , then everyone has to make some small concession .
However , I would like to highlight two points .
However , I remain very worried about the issue of GMOs being present , even ad@@ ven@@ ti@@ ti@@ ously , in organic products .
There are centres of excellence in all the European countries , based on the criteria , which we will be discussing , of the European added value of the programme .
Furthermore , we came to an agreement on the implementation of the European semester , which will help to extend economic governance , by including in the early stages not only budgetary policies but also economic policies and structural reforms for each of the Member States .
We need to coordinate the budgetary policies of the Member States and the social and environmental convergence rules , particularly concerning working conditions , salary progression - yes , salary progression - and the environment .
We in Parliament have a right to expect the Member State or States involved , the Council and the Commission to take preventative measures and action .
In this regard , I would like to thank the Commissioner for the clarity of his speech .
I hope that we shall resolve it in a much more socially @-@ responsible responsible manner , respecting the elementary rules of employment law as applied in all our Member States .
The Commission will cooperate closely with the World Bank and the other parties involved with a view to evaluating the needs and contributing to the reconstruction work in Afghanistan .
We must , though , take account of the variations in national sources of energy and of sectoral balances .
First , the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
We are pleased to see that the Council has heeded this House &amp; quot ; s demands , in particular those relating to the move to codecision and qualified majority voting in such areas as asylum , immigration and the fight against terrorism , not to mention , of course , civil justice .
Firstly , because the enlargement of the European Union , as Mr Brok has just said , is not just another priority , not that I need to remind the Members of this House .
Peace requires an ambitious vision and , in particular , the will to move beyond the Balkans &amp; apos ; history and look towards a European future .
It is important for the national regulatory authorities to continue to play a full role .
It must also take account of the negotiations ahead of it in the areas of energy , climate change , industry and agriculture .
Added to this , the fishing sector is in crisis .
On the one hand the resolution congratulates Turkey on having recently held free and fair elections , calls on the Turkish Government to accelerate the process of reform and welcomes its intention to adopt a new civilian constitution .
I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution drafted by various political groups .
We therefore formally draw the Commission &amp; apos ; s attention to this matter and we should like to know where the implementation of the decisions taken by the budgetary authority is being held up .
I know many have already done so , but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides , and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today .
For all of these reasons , we need to adapt to the demands of our consumers .
The European Union we want to build is not the European Union of old members and new members , it is a Union of all members with exactly the same dignity , and that is a very important point .
I am pleased to have been broadly supported by the Committee on Fisheries , which retained all of these positive and constructive proposals , thus rejecting the very negative vision of fishery activities , which strongly per@@ me@@ ated the Commission communication .
In fact , the way they are presented is not a neutral act .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , I shall let you into a secret : I prefer your own em@@ ol@@ lient presentation to the contribution , here in Strasbourg yesterday , by the French Prime Minister , whose game was one of national division .
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people . There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations .
The issue is one of not turning the Commission into a second Council by ensuring that each Member State is represented . The issue is that of turning the Commission into a genuine supranational body , an authority for the European Union .
This is obviously essential because it cannot simply shift the problems of the European fisheries sector to other areas .
We cannot accept any challenges to this principle , and we believe it should be extended to the whole of the European Union .
Consid@@ eration must also be given to setting up a genuine World Environmental Organisation to which cases of environmental dumping could be referred .
I do not want to talk about what took place earlier .
The Commission must also show consistency .
In paragraph 2 , we say that the budget for the year 2000 should safeguard the prerogatives of the European Parliament .
This also means that in several areas the report does not follow the liberal proposals made by the Commission .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to express my support for Mr De Rossa .
We must therefore adopt proactive measures to provide social protection and access to public services in the field of health , education , housing and so on .
To exclude any threat to supplies , in the context of balanced and sustainable land management , it is essential to affirm the concept of food safety .
President of the Commission . - . Mr President , Mr Jouyet , honourable Members , firstly may I concur with you Mr Pöttering in everything that you have said relating to the tragedy in Mu@@ m@@ b@@ ai , and also say that I share your sentiments relating to the need for the spirit of solidarity in Europe , and the spirit of what must be real European citizenship to be put into practice .
In fact , it is not only a question of adopting the measures in record time , which will allow the measures being addressed in the present debate to be transposed into national law . It is also a question of linking up with the cooperation effort initiated by the Fifteen in the field of justice and home affairs .
Furthermore , the Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development , which will be voted on during your presidency , is in the process of being drafted .
The effects of such an idea must be carefully evaluated , particularly in terms of responsibility .
If unemployment were to plu@@ m@@ met , this expenditure would fall as well .
We should reject the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal and invite it to prepare a new proposal for a directive which takes account of the new factors which have since arisen .
All instruments for cooperation with Russia , both Community and national , must be directed towards this .
Why did I abstain , then ?
The EU needs a real strategy so that it can actually apply the powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon .
By taking common action , the European Union and the United States can constitute a considerable force in the service of our shared values in the world .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to respond first of all to you , Mr Verheugen .
It is not just a question of passengers having rights ; it is a question of airline operators and the national authorities being able to really make the people concerned aware of those rights .
Through its election observation missions the European Union has been paying close attention to the recent political transition in Mauritania , which could set an example for the region .
The text that has just been adopted constitutes an interesting first step towards identifying the different types of lobbyists and the sums they use to try to influence the decisions to be made .
It behoves the Commission to proceed to undertake the necessary checks and to draw the necessary conclusions .
Fal@@ si@@ fied medicinal products make up 50 % of medicines sold over the Internet and 1 % to 3 % of medicines sold by dispens@@ ing pharmac@@ ists .
Thanks to the European Union , however , and here I believe we can thank Pas@@ cal Lamy for his firm stance , we have the beginnings of a broad agenda - the environment , investment and competition can be negotiated on the basis of an explicit consensus .
The level of participation in the labour markets must also be increased and we must render them more flexible by adapting the social welfare systems and reducing labour costs , particularly for workers with less skills .
That is the kind of instruments that we will be proposing . I would also like to thank Parliament for supporting us in this key aim , which will provide reassurance to farmers in the future .
You cannot both be among the strongest advocates of European enlargement and , at the same time , prevent Europe from establishing institutions for enlargement .
That is impossible ; it is the Commission &amp; apos ; s responsibility to intervene to ensure that the European institutions are informed of the legal basis of those negotiations .
Consequently , if we wish to ensure an adequate degree of transparency , the G@@ PA must be transposed by means of a supplementary directive which will both contain the exceptions and special arrangements and refer to the existing EU directives on public tend@@ ering .
Madam President , it would be bad form for me to prolong the debate excessively .
I should like to thank not only the European Parliament , which is pushing things forward , but also all those people who are working &amp; apos ; at the co@@ al@@ face &amp; apos ; , with a great deal of ide@@ alism , often alone , with very meagre resources , putting their hearts into it because they believe in progress .
We do not know when the committee is going to meet to discuss this matter and it is very urgent as the European Board of Dan@@ one is going to meet tomorrow .
Mr Barroso , all the same , the question was clear .
That being said , a single currency means a single monetary policy and a single exchange rate vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis other currencies .
If that is the case , we should make adjustments but continue to bear in mind the original aim of the regulation .
I welcome the suggestion to appoint a special representative , possibly a vice @-@ chairman chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . This person would deal with all human rights issues and would also ensure that individual cases of violation of human rights are followed up .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure I need not remind you that the Community regulation setting up the COM in bananas is the result of a compromise respecting a balance between the interests of the various sources of Community supply ( ACP and dollar area ) , and takes into account earlier commitments of the European Union , namely Community preference , preferential access for ACP state bananas , and GATT rules with regard to third countries .
When adopting the Cunha report a few weeks ago on the reform of the CAP , our Parliament outlined the framework of another agricultural policy . It is a policy that is far more concerned with society &amp; apos ; s needs in terms of decent incomes , jobs , the quality of food and the environment , the balanced management of our territory and international cooperation .
This integration can then take place if there is a fundamental reform in Europe , and so on . However , we should have political instruments and not just economic and social instruments to bring pressure to bear on these political classes .
Today &amp; apos ; s adoption of the Le Foll report on adapting European agriculture to climate change goes along with this approach .
On behalf of my group , I welcome the attitude of the High Representative of the Common , Foreign and Security Policy , Mr Solana , particularly in the Israeli @-@ Palestinian Palestinian conflict , and the positions adopted several weeks ago by the Council and the Presidency , represented by Mr Michel .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like first of all to thank Parliament and its rapporteur , Mr Be@@ az@@ ley , for having succeeded in reaching agreement on all the points under discussion .
We must point out that reinforced cooperation , as provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam , must in particular concern an area that does not come within the Community &amp; apos ; s exclusive pur@@ view , must be aimed at furthering the objectives of the Union , must respect the principles of the Treaties and must be used only as a last resort while concerning a majority of Member States .
The least that can be said is that consumer interests are not always in line with the interests of manufacturing firms .
However , in that respect , let me tell you something that you may not be aware of .
These fishermen , already severely affected by the crisis , will be the main victims of such a measure made necessary by illegal fishing and clandestine industrial networks .
As Mrs Lulling indicated a few moments ago , we must welcome the fact that the amendments included in Mr Martin &amp; apos ; s report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been incorporated into the common position .
The ACP @-@ EU EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique institution that has succeeded in establishing itself as a key player in European @-@ African African relations and in North @-@ South South relations .
What is more , I was able to obtain these amendments yesterday and I believe that we are called upon to have a general discussion today .
This is the purpose of Amendment Nos 44 and 46 .
Commissioner , the Committee on Women &amp; apos ; s Rights and Equal Opportunities has had an exchange of letters with you in relation to the attention paid to the issue of women within the framework of reconstruction and in relation to the proportion of aid earmarked by the European Union for this issue .
As for us , we are making serious preparations , and this is the least that can be expected of the Commission .
Consequently , we feared that has@@ tin@@ ess might undermine the motion of censure , which has to be reserved only for the very serious circumstances for which my group has decided to use it in future .
Amendments acceptable with redrafting : 14 , 15
Europe has to face up to its responsibilities and take on the scourge of the mafia gan@@ gs that are trading in human misery .
The five pillars include the general arrangements , the social clause , the environmental clause , the drugs regime and the &amp; apos ; Everything But Arms &amp; quot ; initiative , which is in force for the least advanced countries .
I hope that we will vote tomorrow on a joint resolution tabled by several political groups , as well as on a number of amendments .
We also need to do this because Commissioner Almunia himself has recognised that that questions of exchange rates , oil prices and the real impact on the EU economy of the sub @-@ prime prime lending crisis will affect the Union &amp; apos ; s projected economic growth .
Finally , we were interested to note the Council &amp; apos ; s willingness to consider aid for research and development .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to thank Mr Sterckx , even if he is not here , for the remarkable job he has done .
Madam President , Mr Karas , ladies and gentlemen , just a few days after the agreement reached in the Basel Committee , I think that it is very important that Parliament is demonstrating its commitment to banking reform and clearly showing that Europe behav@@ es and must behave in a way appropriate to its global standing .
Those who are about to join us are our fellow European citizens . They should never have been separated from us and we are delighted to be reunited with them .
I support the amendments contained in the report by our colleague , Mr González Tri@@ vi@@ ñ@@ o , which oblige companies to respect stricter rules thanks to a better compensation system for users and to ful@@ ler and more accessible information .
This is why the Presidency will do whatever it can to have this common position adopted at the Council meeting on 15 December , so that Parliament can adopt it in its part @-@ session session next January .
We are not about to abandon him with the end in sight .
I am very pleased that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &amp; apos ; Rights and its rapporteur worked towards this , along with the PPE Group . And I should like to thank those colleagues who actively cooperated in the deliberations of the working party we set up .
If they support Sir Leon Brittan &amp; apos ; s personal initiative today , it is because they see an opportunity to enter the European decision @-@ making making process , in the era of the euro and enlargement .
I confirm that the Commission will be following this work closely and will draw a number of definite conclusions from it .
The reform process must provide renewed motivation and must modernise the way we work , but it must retain a European civil service that has one objective : to implement the political plans of the European Union that restore citizens &amp; apos ; confidence .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that Mr Patten &amp; apos ; s comments - and I am sorry that he is not here at the moment - are absolutely unacceptable .
I should also like to thank Mrs Plooij @-@ Van Van Gorsel for the excellent report she has drawn up within a very short time limit .
Today I am grateful to the European Parliament and to Mr Rocard and his committee in particular for recognising the urgency of the matter and allowing the Commission &amp; quot ; s proposals to be examined quickly .
The ball is now in the Member States &amp; apos ; court because it is not enough to legislate : this legislation needs to be transposed into their national laws .
In this respect , the presence of the Council would have been helpful .
However , we are still far from an agreement .
It is also imperative to clarify the relationship between European neighbourhood policy , a framework policy par excellence , and regional initiatives , such as the Black Sea Synergy , the Union for the Mediterranean , and the future Eastern Partnership .
I should like , for my part too , to concur with what has been said in this House , firstly by our excellent fellow Member , Mr Poettering , and then by Mrs Hautala and Mr Wurtz .
This state of affairs cannot simply be ignored by the Commission , by the Council of Ministers or by Parliament , which is always anxious to apply the principle of precaution which , in this case , would allow us to protect Europe &amp; apos ; s economic health and its financial interests .
Faced with this legislative regulation , however , its attitude changed .
The European Union has again missed an opportunity to demonstrate its capacity to react . It would have been nice to see - alongside Commissioner Michel - Presidents Barroso and Bo@@ rell and the High Representative , Mr Solana , making Europe &amp; quot ; s voice heard more clearly .
In fact , they even dispose of a crucial problem , which is of a political nature , and which the European Parliament does not seem willing to resolve .
We expect this to have a positive effect on trade , contributing to the development of intra @-@ regional regional trade in particular .
Secondly , Parliament is calling on the Member States to discuss the possibility of drawing up a European voter &amp; quot ; s card common to all the EU countries .
Some broad prospects must be outlined in order to rebuild or attempt to rebuild a kind of European dream .
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than J@@ ör@@ g H@@ aider .
With regard to the risks of carbon leakage , we are working on two alternatives , which are not mutually exclusive : progressivity of auc@@ tions ; and a carbon inclusion mechanism such as the one planned by the United States within the framework of their own package .
Of course , the Commission supports the compromise reached during the informal trialogue with the Council .
You cannot state , as does the report , that the European Union &amp; apos ; s purpose is to create primary international law to be imposed on all the States and their national law .
I am pleased to note that the spirit of enterprise is one of the eight key competences that all Europeans should have available to them .
Thus , if we are going to support the ongoing process of transition to democracy , we must pay particular attention to the honesty and transparency of the elections , and to the implementation of a policy of dialogue and national reconciliation .
I appeal to the political intelligence of the two rapporteurs to improve this result somewhat , by accepting a number of amendments .
Such common ground can be found , in my view , in the emissions trading mechanism .
One point presents a problem and seems to be meeting with sti@@ ff opposition from the Council and the Commission , as you have just said , Commissioner ; it is the question of extending the scope to all mining and waste processing activities using dangerous substances .
The file on health surveillance includes two points which we see as essential , namely the harmonization of data and definitions concerning health and the creation of a European centre or agency for health , responsible for collecting and centra@@ lizing that data .
In a country where the resources of the healthcare system are limited , what guarantees will be offered to these young women ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , we have been waiting for this regulation .
With these reservations , we approve and support the proposal for a directive , as amended by the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
It should be possible for national legislation to be more restrictive than the directive on this issue .
In fact , one of the lessons we should draw from the recent debates on the motion of censure against the Commission is that the European institutions , which cover many countries , are particularly at risk of becoming cut off from the people .
Europe must go all the way , must respect its own principles and values , must increase its aid to the southern countries , must contribute to development policies and make no concessions to the dictators .
The Committee of Inquiry revealed the serious mistakes made by Commissioners Mac@@ S@@ har@@ ry and Ste@@ ich@@ en , and certain members of their departments ; but the present Commission is not exempt from blame either - especially Mr Fischler .
I think we need , and I am saying this in all sincerity , to send a clear signal to the industry and to the Member States .
The Commission has repeatedly emphasised that all the parties involved , including the minority themselves , need to contribute to this complex process and to come up with solutions .
I broadly agree with the rapporteur on all these points .
First , we did not want to push ourselves forward .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me this evening to present the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon , which has been ready for some time now in the Committee on Budgets .
What we are waiting for is the Council to give us appropriate answers to these specific questions .
October 2005 : 73 Members wrote to the President of the Commission on behalf of Parliament .
Yet even more effort can still be made , as the report shows , in order to reduce health risks and to promote the recycling of material obtained from decommissioning .
Madam President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the words that you used during your first speech about your desire for there to be a Palestinian State , after inter @-@ Palestinian Palestinian reconciliation , are very important .
I am certain that the adoption by the European Parliament of a resolution on this report will contribute a great deal to the process of enlargement to include Croatia .
It must avoid at any price creating a pernicious system in which the weight of bureaucracy puts European aviation out of the running in the international market .
Mr President , during the debate held in preparation for the election of the President of Parliament , I had the opportunity to say what I expected of the new President .
I intend to contribute to the coordination of Member States &amp; apos ; deliberations desired by the Presidency by sending ministers information , particularly on the Unesco process , in order to stimulate the debate between the European nations on this matter .
In connection with preparations for this important event , the Presidency has compiled a list of subjects that should be given priority in the competent international fora .
The first element is the balance in terms of international standards and the establishment of new relations between the WTO and the other international organisations .
That is undoubtedly something to think about if we want the European Parliament to play a better role at international conferences , a role other than that of joint observer together with the Commission .
Those rejecting this Constitution speak of Brussels bureaucracy , of a loss of national sovereignty and of a European superstate .
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group almost agrees with their conclusions , but as a result of a very different logical argument .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am an elected representative from a region in the west of France , where there is a very high concentration of dairy farmers , and I do not believe that you have acknowledged the tragic social situation they are experiencing today .
Secondly , we need a renewed framework for this policy , one that is adapted to the new situations and challenges .
I shall conclude by saying that the issue of volatility - and the impact that speculation on the market has on volatility - is one that the Commission is addressing more extensively , for derived products and commodities alike .
We must therefore change our policy , re @-@ focus focus on law and on the promotion of law , and this is what we are attempting to do with the text of this resolution .
Your next urgent task is to organise that Commission so that it can serve a Europe that is hau@@ ling itself out of the crisis .
It has enabled the de@@ trac@@ tors of the project to realise how useful and , moreover , necessary , this Fund is .
The Commission itself is proposing this , therefore we can only support it and add what I believe to be appropriate comments .
With this in mind , we are working with the Member States on the cross @-@ border border interoperability of electronic signatures .
I particularly welcome the vote on an amendment calling for a financial transaction tax as a possible response to the crisis , even though I am under no illusions about the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s contradictory votes on this issue .
I am pleased to see that the committee has adopted the bulk of the amendment I tabled .
In our opinion , this is what is at stake .
Should the Council not use the Intergovernmental Conference to establish the necessary legal basis for the Council to be able to entrust the ECB with certain specific tasks relating to the prudential supervision of insurance companies too ?
No , there is no fast or easy solution to the crisis we are facing .
Moreover , I must say that I am very cautious . I am not particularly in favour of reopening this debate , because if we do that you will even see certain Member States participating in order to include anything and everything in the budget for this .
We ought to avoid the same errors of conception and implementation .
in writing . - I voted for this recommendation since it highlights the innovative , constructive and democratic character of the convening of Conventions for the revision of the Treaties ( for example , the Convention held from 1999 @-@ 2000 2000 , which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , and the Convention held from 2002 @-@ 2003 2003 , which prepared the draft treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe ) , while recognising the altogether exceptional character of the revision of the Treaties currently made necessary by the implementation of transitional measures concerning the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour for me to speak to you today and to tell you about my deep attachment to the values of the European Union .
We need support and cooperation from our partner nations , which are themselves often source countries or transit countries , if our migration policy is to be made more effective .
By the same token , however , it would be unacceptable for the fight against terrorism to favour new forms of discrimination .
I voted in favour of Mrs Müller &amp; apos ; s report and I should like to highlight the quality of the work done by our rapporteur .
And , to that end , you now want to check the budgets of the Member States a priori in the place of national parliaments .
In this regard , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Gill , my dear friends here today , I strongly recommend that , tomorrow , we adopt the amendment concerning precisely these new technologies , which we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance tabled together with Mrs Buitenweg and which was adopted by a narrow majority in committee .
Yes , generally the European Union regularly condemns in the strongest possible terms the serious human rights violations which , unfortunately , are still being committed practically every day in Colombia .
Despite the failures recognised , the text promotes the liberalisation of the markets , farmers &amp; apos ; responsiveness to market signals , the competitiveness of European agriculture on global and regional markets , and green capitalism .
Genu@@ ine progress was made in the implementation of an area of freedom , security and justice .
Next , this time we would do well to hold an in @-@ depth depth debate with the citizens of all our countries on the kind of Europe to build and on the political , institutional and financial implications of our decisions .
Furthermore , the day after the G20 summit , the Europe @-@ United United States summit will represent an important opportunity for taking these results on board and developing a common approach to several current economic issues .
I am sorry , there is a problem . I will speak later .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I think that in view of the current situation , the European Union should make an effort to assert its credibility as regards the observation missions it sends to these countries .
It is certainly a challenge , but we must accept it for the sake of coming generations .
That is the thinking behind our question to the Commission .
Doubtless there are reasons for this inadequate approach : lack of human resources and lack of financial means .
What we can say is that growth is an aim we pursue in conducting our economic policies , going hand in hand , at the heart of these policies , with employment .
Bri@@ efly , this means that the values , principles , institutions and even , at the request of the Parliamentary conven@@ tione@@ ers , the symbols of the European Union are to be enshrined in the Constitution .
As for the environment , we must bear in mind that our efforts to foster growth and employment must be guided by the aim of sustainable development , one of the guarantors of stability .
We called on Croatia to make huge efforts and we asked Bosnia to do the same ; and these are the very same efforts that enabled us to rebuild Europe after the Second World War .
This exclusion of all criticism , no matter how minor , stands in star@@ k contrast to the reservations voiced by this House when the previous resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference was adopted .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this morning &amp; quot ; s preparatory debate gives me the opportunity to make a final contribution on the current and future direction of Europe &amp; quot ; s policies .
Europe still has some very high unemployment rates today , and the margin for progress in the employment of women , young people and older people , for whom the employment rate d@@ rops dramatically from the age of 52 @-@ 55 55 years , remains great .
Furthermore , I believe it is imperative to point out that the Union &amp; apos ; s objectives with regard to the protection of citizens are not just consistent with the fundamental rights set out in the EU Charter but are based on these rights .
Mr President , one of the means of preventing terrorism is information .
This will take account of experience in applying the rules on public services , and of the differences between Member States .
The Europeans will turn against Europe unless it formulates a genuine industrial policy that is in their service , provides public financing of research that matches up to the requirements , opens a social dialogue worthy of that name .
Of course , in Article 4 of the draft directive , you appear to limit patentability to inventions , and I quote , &amp; apos ; susceptible of industrial application &amp; apos ; .
Several options will need to be considered .
Indeed , I think it will be a very good thing if by introducing these measures we are able , as is estimated , to prevent nearly 7 000 road injuries and some 600 fa@@ ta@@ lities on Europe &amp; apos ; s roads each year .
As you know , it was during the Slovenian Presidency that we were able to reach a positive outcome .
Mr President , for several weeks the world has been undergoing a serious financial crisis .
There , too , the European Union made all the difference .
It is the interests of each of these that the national parliaments have sought to protect .
Mr President , I would simply like to address Mr Tannock in order to denounce his attitude towards those who are demonstrating today , and also expand on what Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit Bendit have said .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union has , for ten years now , been trying to arm itself with legislative instruments in the area of economic immigration .
In a constantly changing media environment , the presence of public service television channels and private television channels , as well as restrictions on mergers and acqui@@ sitions between commercial players , are essential in order to maintain audiovisual pluralism and cultural diversity .
We are all aware of the value of the single currency to the European project .
They are the ones who want democracy , and the fact that the C@@ op@@ ts and the Muslims are now march@@ ing shoulder to shoulder is proof enough of what they want , which is a truly open democracy .
For the time being , it is necessary to stop the justified report concerning the negotiations on strengthening the partnership between the EU and Russia from failing to mention the need to construct a balanced dialogue with the country encompassing all issues of common interest , including democratic values and the energy dimension .
There is , in fact , a certain amount of discord among us on this point .
To put this programme into action we need the active commitment of the presidency , the support of individual Member States and of the Council , and the clear engagement of this Parliament .
However , the EU &amp; apos ; s support is essential to ensure that country &amp; apos ; s independence .
The Union will work closely with the United States and all partners to combat international terrorism .
Let us be clear : to do so , we need to bear in mind three things .
Despite some discussions , the European Union still does not have a great enough presence in this region of the world .
In fact , with the recent preparation of a report on renewable energy sources , what we can see is a piecemeal approach to this issue , which nonetheless is a fundamental issue : once again , I agree with the rapporteur and with many of the speakers .
I think that the European Community should continue to support the Northern Dimension within the framework of the programmes at present being implemented , that is to say TACIS and the European Neighbourhood Policy , and of those to be implemented in the future within the framework of the draft European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument .
The protocol on the seat of the institutions states that 12 monthly plenary sessions are to be held in Strasbourg .
While civilian populations are massac@@ red and children are de@@ human@@ ised by being turned into sl@@ ave soldiers , the loo@@ ting continues .
I am therefore in favour of an increase in the number of air traffic control centres as , not the unification of the whole control system , but the unification of the legal system and also technological unification takes place , as this report , and the research behind the report , have highlighted the absence of European will ...
The consequence of this blind and generous investment : countries with disappointing results out@@ number the countries making substantial progress .
These issues set the European Union the challenge of the economic competitiveness of our companies and of job security for European employees .
At a time when , in all our countries , our fundamental freedoms are increasingly undermined by security policies , we regret that the European Parliament is not properly fulfilling its role of safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms .
As if we should even be asking ourselves whether or not to label products sold on the European market when the consumer &amp; apos ; s freedom of choice is fundamental in European law !
Undoubtedly that system will have to be more comprehensive than the measure available to us today , which is both partial and unbalanced .
So , Mr President , it is the German text which takes precedence .
Of course we remain vigilant when it comes to the issue of human rights .
Each year ECHO s@@ pend@@ s everything it has available for humanitarian actions , and if an ECHO contribution were to be necessary it should be in addition to this .
For this reason , and especially as we prepare for the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg before the end of this year , the proposals and recommendations that the Commission will make will take careful account of your suggestion .
Gender disparity is also prevalent when it comes to wages and salaries . Fi@@ gu@@ res available for 1995 show that for the European Union as a whole , the h@@ our@@ ly wage for a woman is only 73 % of that for a man doing equal work .
We must therefore encourage and help young farmers to establish themselves and to develop their activities since it is they who will help to feed the planet in the future .
These delays beli@@ e the declarations of urgency made here in Parliament .
I could not end , Mr Commissioner , without expressing my pleasure on hearing your proposals a few moments ago in which you expressed the view of the Commission which would , you mentioned , support the inclusion in the annex to the new treaty of a specific statement on the arrangements for island regions .
For this reason we cannot vote in favour of the report .
Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit Bendit , you will have an answer before the start of the sitting , but for now , if you do not mind , we will proceed with the voting .
On your second point of renewable energy which , as you know , is of great interest to me , the Commission &amp; apos ; s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds .
Genu@@ ine rigour should be exercised in the European Union - an effort required of the Member States as well .
We must not introduce more rigidity into provisions that may apply to institutions as different as the Commission and the Court of Justice .
However , Europeans themselves have adopted the euro as a symbol of belonging to the European Union .
I also thank Mrs Panayotopoulos @-@ Cassiotou Cassiotou for her very good report .
For my part , I shall content myself with a more pragmatic approach to this issue .
Certainly not : a significant number of services are already the subject of trade which is , quite rightly , strictly regulated , and encouragement given to trade in services must respect this regulatory framework which was established by the competent public authorities .
This also leads some companies to suggest to their employees that they declare themselves self @-@ employed employed .
The fact is , the economic position of the European Union is very sound , and is much more favourable than it has been over the last decade .
The European Parliament has to approve the selection in order for it to be valid .
Any request for increased mobility or adaptability should necessarily be matched by se@@ am@@ less social cover throughout the territory of the European Union , as regards the transfer@@ ability of pension rights , for example .
The second objective is to create new options in the debate on structural reforms .
This is an absolutely huge challenge .
The European Council in Helsinki , having decided to grant Turkey the status of a candidate for accession , asked the Commission to submit a single framework for European Union financial aid to that country for the pre @-@ accession accession period .
Madam President , could this report be too reck@@ less , too daring ?
I fervently hope that when I address the Conference of Presidents next week our task will be to char@@ t the path towards an interinstitutional agreement that will take Europe into the next decade with real confidence .
I would like , in response to the Andreasen report and to the debate that has just taken place , to present the broad objectives of our strategy , and then to elaborate on some aspects of its implementation .
Because I do not want to be party to this strategy , I did not vote for the relevant amendments .
Mr President , I would not like to tamp@@ er , no p@@ un intended , with the enthusiasm of this House on the subject of the European legal area .
You voted for this , Mr President , and I hope you will be followed by the Committee on Budgets .
At this stage , the governments will have to answer for their actions before public opinion , before their partners , to see whether or not they have reached their objectives .
Europe has demonstrated that it is capable of adopting a dignified , solid and open immigration policy .
It is essential to ensure public understanding and confidence in the new means of payment . Similarly , the stability and integrity of existing systems must be guaranteed .
I will vote in favour of the next two reports , even though the funds allocated to achieving interoperability are meagre and insufficient , and even though the Agency will remain confined within the framework , in which it was established , namely liberalisation .
I believe that this ought to be addressed in the forthcoming revision of the EGF Regulation without compromising redundant workers &amp; apos ; access to the EGF .
It is the final chance for the Council to decide at last to back the opinion of the European Parliament advocating a suspension of the association agreement with Israel until its forces withdraw from the occupied territories .
After that consultation , the Commission issued a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union action for the European Her@@ itage Lab@@ el .
Given that the EU reacted in the former Yugoslavia and in Africa , refusing to be compli@@ cit or complac@@ ent in the face of violations of humanitarian law , why should it keep silent in the case of Israel ?
Still thanks to the forthcoming euro , we will be protected to some extent .
Thank you , Mr Barroso , for your very clear words this morning .
Under these conditions and these only will we be in a position to declare democracy in Togo to be on the right track .
For the future , the European Commission has proposed to implement a cofinancing system .
It is now time to act .
For all the above reasons , I voted against .
This brings me to another important point .
On that basis , the analysis period can actually be reduced to two years , Mr Stockmann , as Parliament is proposing .
I may add that the services I am directly responsible for within the Commission are of the opinion that it is necessary to keep to a strict interpretation of the Treaty .
This all arises by virtue of the crucial precautionary principle . Compli@@ ance with that principle must be formally stated in the revised directive , in order to protect not only the health and safety of consumers but also the interests of farmers .
Roma inclusion is a matter for Europe . It is now up to the European Commission to draft final proposals on the basis of our vote today .
But , if we discover during the preparation of the regulation that there are areas where we need to revisit the directive itself , I will not hesitate to do so .
This is a laudable aim , but European citizens will be the only beneficiaries .
From this point of view , the political timing is not particularly good , since we are asking the spring meeting of the European Council to reach agreement on Lisbon and on the Stability Pact , while possibly postponing the debate on the financial perspective until June .
Firstly , because it is the people of the Member States who are most affected by the economic and social consequences of enlargement and who therefore deserve to be heard .
The very fact that , with every passing year , additional steps to harmonise the rights of employees moving within the European Union are not taken indicates that , thirty years after the initial directives , there is no more harmonisation than there are Community rights to bring employers to book .
When a cross @-@ border border bank is under pressure , finding rapid solutions with several national supervisors in parallel is possible , as the past weeks have shown - but , honestly , it is not easy .
I do think , however , that we need to go further than the cooperation proposed in the resolution .
That said , I also agree that if the physical conditions are not appropriate , it is better to postpone the vote than to proceed under the wrong circumstances .
The Committee on Development has made a number of fundamental comments on the fisheries policy in relation to the development policy .
This assessment , which I hope is balanced , is the basis for the conclusions that I am recommending , and they are as follows : as things stand there is nothing to prevent a joint accession treaty - I repeat , a joint treaty - being signed for Romania and Bulgaria at the beginning of 2005 for accession in 2007 .
I have always tried to keep Parliament informed of these developments .
Finally , the Commission wishes to make it clear that this additional presentation does not encompass its entire programme for years to come in all areas .
We must , quite simply , put an end to unacceptable practices .
We should not limit ourselves to fighting terrorism by force .
In this respect , I believe that the interactive dialogue between the national parliaments and the European Parliament , as well as the consultation of civil societies , are vital elements .
It would amount to deliberately flouting international law . It would mean recognising Israel as the occupying power in the Palestinian Territories and recognising Israel &amp; quot ; s practice of annex@@ ing and colon@@ ising them .
From this point of view , Europe and the Western world , in general , cannot simply look the other way .
This is particularly the case as regards Article 100 of the Treaty , which would also permit the implementation of special mechanisms for countries within the euro zone . We believe it is essential to explore these given the severity of the crisis .
These are the sorts of regimes we are encouraging with our constructive dialogue policy .
I would first like to highlight an initial point .
I should like to thank you in advance , High Representative , for bearing these messages , especially this evening .
It must be able to count on their contributions to the debate on European democracy .
Likewise , I could speak of the numerous resolutions voted for by the Parliament - with just as big a majority - involving requests for initiatives which have not been responded to or acted upon for years .
The drop in interest rates - which I welcome - should be selec@@ tively applied in order to promote employment and not speculation , which should be tax@@ ed .
Secondly , the list of accompanying measures provided for by the Schengen Agreements should be reinforced , not truncated as the European Parliament suggests and as Mrs van Lancker has once again demanded , especially when critici@@ zing the data on undesirable ali@@ ens contained in the SIS , the Schengen Information System .
Trans@@ partisan work has been carried out in Ireland over the last few days , at which you were present , Mr President , representing the European Parliament .
We call on the Council , the Commission and the co @-@ presidents presidents of the ACP to use every political and commercial means at their disposal to ensure that the Nigerian Government applies and ab@@ ides by these conventions and the African Charter on Human and People &amp; apos ; s Rights .
For whatever the merits of your statement , Mr President of the Commission , there is a need for persons outside the Commission to carry out an investigation - and through a procedure in which both sides are heard .
Furthermore , the European Parliament does not fulfil any of the conditions required for it to become the high assembly of a federal Europe .
I was struck , in particular , by the comments of the last speaker , who gave us an encouraging message .
This is exactly the philosophy and the approach of the reforms in the Lisbon Treaty , which European and national leaders as a body wish to impose on the peoples and nations against their will .
in writing . - It is simply unacceptable that this report has been adopted by the majority Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament ; that is why , in line with our rapporteur Mr Hoang N@@ goc , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has voted against it .
The Union should give preference to multi@@ partite initiatives involving national governments , the private sector , local and / or regional authorities and NGOs .
Although it is in fact the Member States , rather than the European institutions , who decide on their budget , we shall vote against this report as it serves as a cover and a justification for austerity measures and ass@@ au@@ l@@ ts on public services .
The industry has been in the picture for a long time and has been able to plan the necessary investments for developing alternative methods .
I am not going to comment on this point .
Mr President , I am wondering what actions the European Union will introduce to ensure that all Member States observe the right of asylum and respect the human rights of people arriving from the southern shores of the Mediterranean .
These are not the great break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s in democracy that will bring the European Union closer to the citizens .
I therefore reiterate my full and wholehearted support for the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal , at the same time taking a critical view of the content of Mr Pirker &amp; apos ; s report .
It is due to the actions of Europe that this agency has come into being .
But we must also - the Commissioner is well aware of this - move forward with environmental taxation and taxation on revenue arising from capital , which are all areas where the debate is st@@ alling .
Moreover , we suggest that , in a monetary union , debt should also be managed in common and that we should be able to envisage mutual debt issuance .
Nonetheless , the proposal makes several improvements - which we have voted for - to the status of persons who originate from third countries and who are residing in the European Union .
Another aspect relates to protection because , in a way , our fellow citizens fear that Europe does not protect them enough .
It is of political importance , as it demonstrates that the Commission is interested in fully harn@@ essing the educational and social values of sport .
Is@@ sues related to the information society and the Internet are of great interest to me .
In this respect , the Commission and Member States support the action of the European Union &amp; apos ; s special envoy to the Great Lakes region , Mr A@@ jell@@ o , and the efforts actively deployed by the African leaders to renew dialogue between the parties .
Finally , I should like to tell Mr J@@ onckheer that , for all sorts of reasons , I absolutely agree with him on the matter of citizenship .
Whilst France must now take satisfaction in the fact that the European Union has finally adopted France &amp; apos ; s position in the field of prevention , we remain concerned about the appropriations that these new political choices will require .
Surely Europe risks reducing its own emissions by only a small proportion by conten@@ ting itself with making a contribution to reducing them outside of Europe by means of the compensation mechanism ?
If I am bringing this subject up again , it is because the socio @-@ economic economic repercussions of the recommended measures certainly deserve more in @-@ depth depth consideration .
You may be certain that the presidency of the Council and the Commission are determined to make very concrete , specific and urgent progress in terms of responding to the situation and endeavouring to do so very visibly .
We must not forget that we are discussing the budget and not a secondary issue .
Parliament and the Commission will now be able to set to work without delay , which was the most important thing at this difficult time , where there are many challenges to take up swiftly for the sake of all Europeans .
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme , local operators have combined forces , debated and prepared projects .
As I have already had occasion to say to you , the measures that have been taken have in fact been either within a national context or within a framework of traditional multilateral diplomacy .
As long as Israel continues to occupy the West Bank , as long as Israel fails to offer a positive solution to the Palestinians of the West Bank , more and more Palestinians will turn to Hamas .
In my opinion , this will be the overriding issue of the European Union @-@ Russia Russia Strategic Partnership to be negotiated shortly , as well as of the European Energy Summit proposed for next year by President Chirac .
There is so much more to say , but I want the Council &amp; apos ; s representatives to know that the European Parliament is keen to adopt this unfamiliar culture of security and defence , and we hope the Nice Summit is a great success .
Third country nationals can already participate in many ways in local life within the European Union .
Mr President , the Commissioner answered one of my two questions but not the other .
Madam President , first of all I would like to say that I have enormous respect for Mrs Haug , who was passionate in her presentation of a comprehensive , demanding and , at the same time , very brave budgetary report , which was voted through unanimously in the Committee on Budgets and which aims to clarify Parliament &amp; apos ; s need for transparency and clarity in preparation for the 2009 budget .
Once it is signed , whether we like it or not , this agreement will inevitably be in the spotlight , and we , the European Union , will be forced to justify our idea of European foreign policy and its democratic basis to public opinion .
I do not need to tell you that around the Council table there were certain people who found it difficult to include the words &amp; apos ; regions with legislative powers &amp; apos ; in the declaration and difficult to recognise , as the European Council , that those regions may have a place and a say .
It is not , however , my fault , Commissioner , if there is a wish@@ y @-@ wash@@ y wash@@ y consensus in this Parliament .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for almost three years the European Union and the Member States have been committed to improving the effectiveness of our cooperation with developing countries .
The Commission has drawn the attention of the Greek authorities - I personally have done so twice on two visits to Athens within the space of nine months - to the need to set up efficient administrative structures before Community appropriations are transferred .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioners , I will spare you the high @-@ flown flown sentiments and I also hope to spare you any naivety .
If we wish to protect health , pharmaceutical le@@ af@@ lets must be as clear and comprehensive as possible , and must satisfy basic quality criteria .
We shall of course take account of your proposal , Mr De Rossa .
We have therefore had some successes .
I see it rather as yet one more chance for peace in the Middle East .
What has happened is that the World Bank set up a study on the extraction industries , which , after two years of consultation with public bodies , governments and business , has produced a report which is damning with regard to its development policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , our public finances are in a situation of crisis and we know that part of the solution may lie in reducing some spending , but that a large part of the solution is in Member States &amp; apos ; ability to raise more funds .
The European Union is best placed - or should be best placed - to show that multilateralism provides the answer to problems which can no longer be solved on a purely national basis .
Under the guise of strengthening freedom of movement and residence in the European Union for Community nationals , it introduces real equality of treatment between the latter and citizens of third countries .
By virtue of their active participation in European integration , they are no less European citizens than anyone else , and their associations and NGOs are also actively engaged in the effort to promote Europe .
That is why we , along with Mrs Niebler and others , have devoted a great deal of attention to the way in which this European Research Council would operate .
This idea of positive complicity with Parliament will be very important over the next five years .
Europe needs fruitful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission , the two institutions that are always at the forefront of the European project .
In fact , on tomorrow &amp; apos ; s agenda , the Conference of Presidents has tabled its proposal for the establishment of a temporary committee , not a committee of inquiry .
The European Union notes the need for a progressive and irreversible opening of the Cuban economy towards the outside world and reaffirms its wish to be Cuba &amp; apos ; s partner in this process .
That is the added value of the European Union .
Madam President , you know that from next year , at both world and European level , we are going to make the anti @-@ doping doping campaign a spearhead of our sports policy .
I therefore welcome with a great deal of satisfaction the proposals in Mr Watson &amp; apos ; s report .
The European Union has , and will continue to have , a crucial and specific responsibility for being an international presence on the ground in Kosovo , replacing the United Nations .
From the beginning , however , this Parliament has , as you know , requested transparency , or in any event information , concerning the nature of the debates taking place within the Council of Govern@@ ors , and I believe that that request is a legitimate one .
For more than five years it has been subjected by the Council to a process of simplification , dus@@ ting @-@ down down and improvement , which is to be w@@ ound up under the Belgian Presidency . At least that is what the European Parliament hopes .
This situation is unacceptable , Commissioner .
in writing . - I am glad we have secured a balanced agreement with the Council .
There will be no successful reform of the Pact if we do not build , as a complement , a European budgetary policy , with a genuine budget to help finance the objectives of sustainable development and cohesion agreed at the Lisbon and Gothenburg summits .
There is also a need to address all the points that we have mentioned .
in writing . - Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Mr Jouyet , Mrs Benita Ferrero @-@ Waldner Waldner , I must firstly thank my fellow Members who have congratulated the French Presidency of the European Union and welcomed the actions of Nicolas Sarkozy in this difficult conflict between Russia and Georgia .
This was a vote eagerly awaited by European citizens , who struggle to understand their governments &amp; quot ; attitudes on this issue .
I think that Parliament must urgently adopt a position and the Council must issue a statement on this matter this week .
I would also like to confirm that we support the general structure of the project .
I personally wanted to emphasise the need to take territorial cohesion into account .
It already forms part of the policies to which the EU , and specifically the Commission and the Fisheries Committee , are committed , whereas this report is concerned with regional development policy .
I should like to make myself very clear : we do not require two calls for competition simply because we believe that that is unnecessary .
Europeans are therefore informed of the way in which their data is used and , fundamentally , they can request that those data be rectified .
In other words , all the conditions have now been met and we can now make real headway in this area . That is the reason , Commissioner , for our question to the Commission , which has always expressed its determination to make headway in this area hand @-@ in in @-@ hand hand with the European Parliament .
That does not , of course , in any way exempt Turkey from the obligations that any accession candidate must fulfil , and the European Union will make sure of that .
Given the enormous amount of time that has lapsed , I therefore find it logical to accept all the amendments which move in the direction of re @-@ establishing establishing the position at the time of the first reading .
What needs to be done is , therefore , a matter of medic@@ alisation and of seeing how , with the doctors at our disposal , particularly independent doctors , and with regular independent checks , we can effectively achieve a genuine public health policy .
Now to the subject of transparency . I can conceive that the ministers with responsibility , the President @-@ in in @-@ office office of the Council with responsibility for justice and internal security might regularly appear before the competent committees of the European Parliament to draw up , let us say , a report on the activities and also on the Schengen manu@@ als .
I shall conclude by recalling that one of the points highlighted by the report is this very lack of information , resulting in the stun@@ ted development of a sense of European citizenship .
That said , Europe is set to create more jobs in the 1995 @-@ 2000 2000 period , generally speaking , than were lost in the 1990 @-@ 1994 1994 period .
We do not want relocation , but it is important for this industrial base to adapt to the new constraints of global competition and , above all , to the major challenges of climate change and of more sustainable growth .
If Europe were no longer competitive , then how on earth could the Union account for the li@@ on &amp; quot ; s share of world trade ?
The European Parliament , in order to give the illusion that it is trying to react - in spite of the fact that it is jointly responsible for the situation - is therefore taking the initiative of adopting a report on democratic accountability in the third stage of EMU .
I would point out that these conclusions are our common rule as , obviously , they were adopted unanimously by all the Member States . That is the mandate the Council has given itself for the next phase in the examination of this candidacy , which has already been discussed at length and in detail today .
Is that possible ?
I am thinking of entry permits for independent NGOs and United Nations special rapporteurs , and for the International Red Cross .
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
We think that the Lahti Summit could be a great moment for Europe if the Heads of State or Government can actually now agree to produce concrete results as part of the innovation agenda .
The first is that we must continue to prioritise support for the regions lagging the furthest behind in development terms , for future Member States but also for current EU Member States .
Over and above that statement of principle , Europe must give practical support to this initiative with directives and policies that will , in the long run , integrate all the electronic systems , nom@@ adi@@ c or not , and make it possible to control the processes and to drive cars that are safer and cleaner , with lower CO2 and particu@@ late emissions .
in writing . - I voted for the report .
As a result , the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s compromise text stresses the importance of appointing the High Representative for the CFSP in Cologne . It also stresses that this High Representative must be supported by the policy planning and early warning unit and must also have the ability , through his or her personality , to play an important role .
The amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control are good too .
Employment is our number one priority , even if the method of tackling the problem is in flux .
In this context , a wide variety of solutions must be considered , provided that there is no desire to impose upon people placed in these detention centres conditions of sem@@ i @-@ imprisonment imprisonment such as are seen in certain places .
I also wish to highlight the quality of the work carried out by the Council , in particular , since the start of the Spanish Presidency .
Personally speaking , I would like to underline two points , the first on the issues that you brought up in your statement and the second on what will certainly be the subject of future discussions that we will hold , particularly within the framework of the Convention .
Parliament would then be able to decide whether or not it is in favour of holding a secret ballot .
Nevertheless , a proper reading of the subsidiarity principle would call on us to look at a number of the problems raised by this report , in a more flexible way , in a more appropriate way , which would be more effective than a systematic and sometimes abusive communitarization of the issue .
This gives rise to great concern .
rapporteur . - Mr President , Mr President of the European Central Bank , ladies and gentlemen , the annual report of the European Central Bank always offers an opportunity for the European Parliament to review monetary policy and to supplement the work carried out by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs through the monetary dialogue conducted four times a year with the President of the European Central Bank .
As such , I welcome the role played by the Commission in terms of coordinating the management of major disasters via the Brussels @-@ based based Monitoring and Information Centre .
Mr President , my group fully supports the aim of this directive , which is to establish a Community framework to ensure and maintain the continuous improvement of safety in nuclear installations within the European Union .
Mr President , the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis , in my view , only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people , social out@@ casts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union .
Here is another result : what do the people pol@@ led think about the role played by the European Union in fifteen or so areas ranging from environmental protection to the fight against terrorism , via social policy , with the protection of social rights only appearing at the end of the list ?
We have strengthened the role of both institutions .
I should first like to welcome this good news , after these setbacks , as it opens the way to this Treaty of Lisbon which we so want and which includes - and I am not forgetting it in this debate - the Charter on Fundamental Rights .
Now , the stakes are high . It is , in fact , a question not only of forging closer links between the European universities but also of boosting the competitiveness of higher education provision by making it more attractive to students and teachers in the rest of the world .
Lastly , I have supported the provisions in favour of greater transparency in financial relations between ports and Member States .
The political world is changing very quickly and we in Europe are coming up with ideas , but we have never been able to adopt the resources needed to implement them pragmatically as regards the political expectations of Parliament , certainly , but also of our citizens .
Unfortunately that is not the case .
But we must be coherent .
I welcome the fact that the European Parliament resolution calls on all Zimbabwe &amp; apos ; s political parties to work together in drafting a new democratic constitution , acceptable to all the people of Zimbabwe , prior to the next elections .
It is too complex .
It is once again a matter of urgency , as a first step as a safeguard and a precaution , to restore controls at all our national borders and to condemn the irresponsible and obsolete Schengen agreements .
As President of the Commission , and together with Mrs Ashton , will you take action along these lines and , if so , how ?
Specific improvements to the Directive are no doubt necessary to take account of technological developments , but we must ensure that these adjustments are not premature .
The challenge is huge : in Europe alone , almost 80 million people still live below the poverty line .
We have a very important political role to play here , and I am convinced that Mr Frattini and Mr de Vries will heed what we say and convey our views .
The regulation must be amended and Commission staff must be increased .
Personally , I admit that I was opposed to this but it was your wish and I can understand it .
If , therefore , you wish to oppose this addition , you must vote against .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the new Hungarian constitution drafted by the Orbán government is not lacking in rather striking articles , as my fellow Members have pointed out .
In this context , I am thinking , amongst other things , of the Trans@@ nis@@ tri@@ an conflict in the Republic of Moldova .
This is one way in which they have shown their in@@ capacity to follow a policy in this field that is capable of limiting environmental pollution and preventing environmental disasters now or in the future .
Turkey must without further ado fall in line with the rulings of the European Court of Justice as a token of acceptance of international relations as defined by us , and not just by them .
Mr President , our Committee on Budgets , with the laudable exception of my colleague , Mr Dell &amp; apos ; Alba , is proposing - without saying so , naturally - that we reduce our spending , but we have not gone far enough .
Madam President , I wish to speak on a completely different subject , but as this Parliament knows , the Convention entrusted with the task of drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has just completed its work , and this is cause for satisfaction .
Schengen has subsequently been divided up and integrated into the framework of the Union , and the legislative provisions of the Community and of the Union are gradually replacing and developing the Schengen Convention and other decisions relating to it .
Ne@@ goti@@ ating a new agreement will therefore be difficult and painful .
Ladies and gentlemen , in the last 18 months , we have made enormous progress towards putting in place a financial system that is more ethical , robust and responsible .
The aim of this global approach is to deal with all of the main dimensions of immigration together and in a balanced way .
On the other hand , although it is true that the previous Commis@@ sions presented their vision , this did not always represent the expression of a real partnership with Parliament or the Council .
We do not agree with the notion whereby European standards and rules have to be compulsory in the economic field but whereby subsidiarity and opt @-@ out out clauses need systematically to be invoked when it comes to social rights and to the protection of workers &amp; quot ; health .
For all of these matters , the negotiation and conclusion of agreements with one or more third countries falls within the exclusive competence of the Community .
On the question of open coordination , I agree that our role still needs to be defined and the criteria need to be more clearly adjusted . But our role is to facilitate and promote open coordination between the Member States .
If this process continues , and if the Commission draws the conclusions it should from these round tables and from our report , I for my part can promise it that it will run no risk of a motion of censure .
Firstly , the Treaties say that the EU is open to European countries ; 95 % of Turkey &amp; quot ; s territory , of which the capital is Ankara , is located in Asia .
En@@ ter@@ prises can access all the necessary information on European programmes and on the main national and regional players in the various Member States .
I wish to end by saying that I have often called in this House for the debts of third world countries to be canc@@ elled , but this debt cancel@@ lation must be conditional , Mr President , on these countries truly respecting human rights , workers &amp; apos ; rights and the rights of children and women .
It would also be a good idea to evaluate the extent to which a tax such as this could help to stabilise the financial markets .
The Commission does not seem entirely satisfied by this type of answer , however , since it is raising other arguments .
You also stated , Mrs Wallström , that all Member States were behind in the transposition of the directive into national law .
In Europe , however , as many people have said , the position of research looks worrying if one looks at the figures .
Thanks to the amendments which he has presented in his report , we believe we will be able to reach an agreement with the Council with a view to adopting this proposal at first reading .
Also , although I regret that the European right , which has a majority in Parliament , has managed to adopt amendments to the text which cast widespread , exagger@@ ated suspicion on the sincerity of asylum seekers , I warmly welcome the adoption of this report .
I am convinced that this is where a certain number of solidarity measures must be put in place .
The third focus of the French Presidency will be to bring Europe closer to the citizens .
The report by Mrs Cederschiöld rightly stresses the need for the Council to propose concrete measures and to involve the applicant countries that hope to join the European Union in whatever prevention measures might be established by the Council .
I consider that approval of the report is the condition for establishing Parliament &amp; quot ; s authority in respect of the Constitutional Treaty , but I am sorry that amendments tabled by a number of us have been rejected .
The project is the result , stressed in the ESDP , of the implications of the introduction of the euro and the pursuit of economic liberalization .
I firmly believe that , by working together , we shall achieve our common goal of a political agreement in December .
Yes , indeed , we need more growth and more job creation , driven by better coordination and more research and development and , yes indeed , we need to face new social realities .
It does not necessarily mean more centralisation of powers .
Madam President , I think that the exercise of religious freedom should be guaranteed by all the Member States and by all the candidate countries .
The latter have tried , once again , to impose their rather cynical logic , which consists of maintaining protectionism for their own agriculture and obtaining free access for their industries the world over .
We must implement a political system in line with a viable environment @-@ friendly friendly economy , and this means meeting the target of a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions .
As in previous financial years , this situation is largely caused by the poor implementation of Structural Fund programmes ( representing EUR 3.@@ 13@@ 4 billion or 66 % of the under @-@ spend spend ) and this gives considerable cause for concern .
I voted in favour of the in &amp; apos ; t Veld report , of the Kirkhope , Al@@ bre@@ cht and Díaz de Mera García Consuegra reports on a package of measures concerning Europol , and of the Al@@ f@@ ano report on the European Cri@@ me Prevention Network , calling for the rejection of the Council &amp; apos ; s proposals on these matters .
Vo@@ ting for this budget would go against the European general interest .
Allow me at this point , Madam , to diverge slightly from your own analysis .
We do , however , deplore the un@@ communic@@ ative and off@@ hand attitude of the Council over the last few weeks , in spite of the good will of some Member States .
Well , this year we are going to publish a review of the efforts made to reach that target .
The challenge of illegal immigration cannot be solved exclusively by those Member States that are more particularly exposed because their borders coincide with the external border of the Union .
We should therefore ensure that the principle of subsidiarity , to which my group is particularly committed , is not called into question through such methods .
Her report makes provision for this and I support it .
We must vote overwhelmingly in favour of the proposals from Mrs Rothe .
Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of &amp; apos ; to defend the countries of Europe better &amp; apos ; , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations .
The best way to protect both Israeli and Palestinian citizens is to re @-@ establish establish a proper border between the two peoples .
Finally , I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are , in any case , familiar with , but whose main elements I should like to reiterate .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Gallagher on his work and to take my turn in recalling the memory of our former colleague Mr Macartney , who initiated this report on the regionalisation of the CFP .
These are the two derogations to which the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s resolution for which we voted today is most strongly opposed : it disputes that the Member States have any right to propose texts , on the pretext that they would exercise this power in an uncoordinated manner ; it wishes the qualified majority system to apply more widely ( or perhaps totally ; this is not made quite clear ) , a wish that would largely be granted by the Treaty of Nice if it is ratified .
Another point that has been addressed at length and is of concern to the Council is the situation in Lebanon .
That , in any case , was the mandate given them .
We must overcome national self @-@ interest interest and rediscover a mature approach to the European political project .
The national level is the most appropriate for implementing this dimension .
That is why we say that we are not defending Parliament &amp; apos ; s rights , but only the rights of the European Union and the need for the European Union .
The Council will likely do whatever it wants but at least we can vote .
The rest is to remain unchanged , as these were merely clarifications .
The second reason for our vote against is related to a number of worrying statements made by the Commissioners @-@ designate designate during the hearings before the European Parliament .
The first priority is to re@@ k@@ ind@@ le growth , and with growth restored we shall be able to tackle the necessary structural reforms .
The Council reiterates that the Helsinki European Council decided to consider Turkey as a candidate country which aims to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria as those that are applied to the other candidate countries .
Even now it is in the process of agreeing to the use of European wine designations by producers outside the Community .
Last year , Parliament adopted a method comprising the adoption of the Charter , the establishment of means , including the network of experts , and a joint effort by three rapporteurs , in order to achieve a consensus .
However , considerable progress remains to be made , and this mainly in the area of asylum .
Europe will not be able , at least in the short term , to rid itself of its dependence on countries outside Europe for its energy supplies .
I nevertheless find it regrettable that this action plan is not a legally binding instrument .
I wanted to stress this point .
I have already expressed my curi@@ o@@ sity to know the estimated additional cost of the better regulation initiative .
That is what we have been told recently .
I think that Parliament should intervene , however , rather because what is at stake here is democracy , the consolidation of democracy in Cambodia .
Madam Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen I must congratulate Mrs Nicole Fontaine on the excellent work that she has done in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , in preparing the report on the European voluntary civilian service programme .
The proposals outlined in the Commission Communication of 4 May , including , in particular , a planned extension of the &amp; apos ; exceptional circumstances &amp; apos ; under which internal border controls may be restored , leave me somewhat perplex@@ ed .
This is a del@@ usion .
However , in terms of the social dialogue at European level , both sides of industry in Europe are already heavily involved in two aspects of Community action : coordination of economic policies , and the effort to implement the European strategy for jobs .
We need to ensure that everyone shoulders their responsibilities .
Europe has thus reaffirmed its position as a host for all migrant populations , and considerable emphasis has been placed on full respect for the principle of non @-@ refoulement refoulement and on the duty to render assistance as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .
The future enlargement of Europe , confirmed by the Helsinki conclusions , poses the problem of the applicant States respecting the requirements of developing equal opportunities and promoting women &amp; apos ; s freedom .
Our guiding principle was , and remains , the general European interest .
As far as women are concerned , we agree entirely with the Commission &amp; apos ; s report of February 1999 on Women and Science , and we will ensure that we encourage the presence of women in the fifth framework programme .
Now , the question of cross @-@ border border mobility is a real issue for European integration , for developing a new European generation and simply for allowing our citizens to see the practical advantages of the European Union . There are far too many administrative obstacles to these cross @-@ border border movements , especially in the social and fiscal spheres .
I would like to say that I do not believe we could have gone any further , at least not at this stage .
Thirdly , Commissioner , you said that we must comply with environmental standards . We take note of and welcome that .
To be able to have an adequate and appropriate pension in a Member State of the EU is the necessary complement to the principle of the free movement of people .
Mr President , the resolution on the European Council , as you are well aware , is very wide @-@ ranging ranging .
These are the facts .
This is why we think it reasonable to remove these reports from the agenda now , so that they can be re @-@ examined examined later , within a wider political framework .
The Commission is working , of course , to help the Member States find solutions to respond to the infringement procedures .
In a bid to find a solution to these human tragedies , the Commission and Parliament are proposing to organise political dialogues among States and to introduce yet more programmes and cooperation plans .
The new United Nations Human Rights Council ( UN@@ H@@ RC ) has the potential to develop into a valuable framework for improving the human rights situation in the world .
For example , when it aims to encourage replacing Member States with the European Union at the IMO or to develop the inspection and restraint powers of the European Maritime Safety Agency , to the point of transforming it into a veritable federal authority ; or again when it advocates the establishment of an integrated European coastguard system , while being very careful not to specify who would finance it and who would be in charge of it , but which would nevertheless have numerous functions , including , in no particular order , ensuring maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment , fisheries surveillance , protection against terrorism or even the assign@@ ment of emergency mo@@ or@@ ings and ports in the event of an accident at sea .
I should also like today to draw your attention to a new situation .
We should , and we must , congratulate them .
Further efforts are required in this area in order to fulfil our shared commitment to make our people more in touch with our measures and to promote the European dimension .
I would like therefore to thank the European Parliament for being truly committed to this and I hope that , with the Commission , we can gradually meet everyone &amp; apos ; s expectations , having witnessed today how important and acute these are .
We must therefore put in place effective measures to combat all forms of violence , by combining prevention , punitive action and support for victims .
The third cause is the excessive , even ins@@ ane , taxation practised by the Member States , and this pro@@ to @-@ socialist socialist policy has been continued , if not actually initiated , by conservative governments .
Does this proposal exist , or does it not ?
With the Constitution , you would be able to vote in an election , and you could refuse the option proposed to you .
Another example of this would be to impose specifications on the pharmaceutical corporations obliging them to produce drugs for these diseases , which the report says are neglected by the industry because they are not profitable enough .
However , as a doc@@ tor , I must point out that as regards resistance to antibiotics , the problem , unfortunately , is not limited only to the bac@@ ter@@ ia known as sal@@ mon@@ ella .
In return for their support of our agenda in terms of society , the environment , health and workers &amp; apos ; rights , developing countries with average revenue and emerging economies are going to be asking for substantial improvements in access to our markets .
Henceforth , the debate in each country should focus on the common issues and on European interests , as was the case in the French referendum campaign .
I believe that the debate has shown us that there was a very large majority in favour of these principles .
I think that ECB decisions are generally transparent , based on a good flow of information and open objectives .
Do you not think , therefore , that the Commission could at least carry out a feasibility study ?
What needs to be improved ?
It is for this reason that we will vote against this report .
In Baghdad and in New York or Washington , we want to defend an idea of Europe , Mr President , in which many progressive men and women still place their hopes .
Its second argument is if the United Nations supports this action , all well and good ; if it is against this action , it does not matter , we shall take action with the support of our friends .
I should like Parliament to decide on this request for an amendment to the Minutes .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the report by my excellent Polish colleague Janusz Lewandowski on the 2009 budget guidelines for the &amp; apos ; other sections &amp; apos ; , namely the European Parliament , but also the Council , the Court of Justice , the Court of Auditors , the European Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions , the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor .
How do we allow freedom of movement for workers within Europe and at the same time safeguard the employment rights of those who move ?
I really think that we have laid the foundations for future action .
There are many other criteria and many other methods , and I be dealing with them in the report I am currently preparing on the competitiveness of European industry .
We cannot now recommend that the House take a different decision .
I should like to react at once to two points .
This year , together with the vast majority of Members of the European Parliament , I refused to grant the Council of Ministers discharge in respect of its activity in the 2009 financial year .
The European Economic and Social Committee has played an active role in gathering ideas from its national counterparts , which will enrich the debate - in fact , I will be meeting the Economic and Social Committee in Prague .
It is very important that we have this evidence .
I believe that the overall emission reduction effort of each Member State by 2020 should be determined on the basis of the starting level of emissions per in@@ habitant , without prejudice , of course to the solidarity mechanisms between states .
Although we should be pleased about the extension of the Schengen area , the common European approach means that the United Kingdom and Ireland need to join their partners as soon as possible so that the same rules can be applied to the movement of persons as to the movement of goods .
I am thinking , instead , of acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide of 19@@ 15 .
Finally , I must alert the House to the latest developments .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have given my backing to this oral question because I think it is of the utmost importance for the European Commission , and the European Union in particular , to be transparent and irreproachable where lobbying is concerned .
We have to speak clearly and with conviction to the electorate about this Europe of results .
How did a statement from the Commission come to be made after the Council &amp; apos ; s report , when the Council was in fact alone competent to give an account of an informal meeting that was essentially intergovernmental ?
Eth@@ ni@@ c issues are at the heart of political debate .
In this environment of sub@@ du@@ ed inflationary pressures , we continued with our policy of lowering our key rates further .
I have also paid heed to the criticisms ai@@ red about the European Union as regards coordination and exchanges of information .
We have to deal with this lack of regulation .
. - I strongly support the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium as an indispensable factor for effective cooperation between Member States with regard to the protection of children from sexual abuse .
That is why I pray that the European and national institutions might take the contributions of the poorest families and citizens seriously .
I therefore believe that we really have framed and defined very clearly the aspect of responsibility .
I believe that we need to develop and evolve our instruments in relation to communication policy , communication both with European farmers and with European consumers , and , above all , at international level .
However , if we want that Commission - and I understood that Mr Barroso wanted it too - then I believe that it must structure its action around competences organised within four or five pillars , each pillar being placed under the political responsibility of a vice @-@ president president invested with the authority and the ability - and with the power too - to ensure the consistency of the entire policy within his or her pillar .
I am thinking , for example , of the Palestinian Authority , which we help , which is funded almost entirely by us .
In this respect , I also believe it is very positive that the Member States are themselves considering these issues of mobility , which are primarily their responsibility .
I had hoped we would go much further in implementing a procedure of economic arbitration with regard to European regulators , but of course , we could not achieve everything at once .
Otherwise , we will inevitably be left with patch@@ y and non @-@ compulsory compulsory measures .
Indeed , this package cannot work without the strong , unanimous commitment of the Member States .
However , the increasingly aggressive attitude of Communist China towards Taiwan constitutes a threat to this peace that is all the more serious because the leaders in Beijing have nuclear weapons .
- I voted in favour of the creation of a temporary commission , for it is evident that we must maintain absolute vigilance on the subject of safety at sea in Europe , so that the measures we adopt in this House might be fully and effectively applied in the Member States .
I do not think this is the case , but we could ask him .
The application of criminal sanctions will have to be negotiated by the European Union &amp; apos ; s Presidency on behalf of the Member States .
This is something that we can be pleased about , even though I do share the reservations which other Members have expressed .
This is what we demand of you , Commissioner .
Everyone has something both to offer and to learn , but I can never emphasise enough that we not only need action at the level of the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament but also need actively to involve the national parliaments , social partners , national parties - and not only the European parties - and European public opinion .
I have indeed heard your call for solidarity , and the Commission can accept an amendment in the preamble to the regulation , in order to give a political signal along the lines of creating improved , formal solidarity mechanisms .
You highlight the advances that have been made but without ignoring the problems that still have to be resolved .
I certainly recall the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s proposal .
You say that this transatlantic agreement is feasible because it is based on a fundamental agreement between parties with common values .
We all believe , since this is a subject that is brought up by the press , both in France and across the border into Germany - we are , after all , in Strasbourg - that no countries tried , in any working language of the European Union , last Monday , in the setting of Eurogroup , to call into question the independence of the European Central Bank .
It is a good point for us , so carry on !
I argue in favour of the creation of a European agency for the safety of land car@@ ri@@ age of dangerous materials to promote a truly comprehensive safety policy at Union level .
This was your objective , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , and I welcome the fact that the latest known US proposals seem to be moving in that direction .
It only has at its disposal the specific powers conferred by the treaty . It must comply with the latter .
The European Union also plans to raise these issues at the next meeting with Pakistan , on 4 June this year .
That , then , is a year which should further develop the European Union &amp; apos ; s commitment to children .
I am convinced that the European Union has a leading role to play in the development of large research programmes and that it can bring real added value by consolidating the European Research Area ( ER@@ A ) .
We are determined to show that we have certain political , moral and diplomatic requirements in international relations , and in fact , to face up to our ideals .
On all of these issues , I know that the Spanish Presidency will press ahead with determination .
Madam President , one of the priorities of the Council Presidency is to increase the influence of the EU on the international stage and , more specifically , in Latin America .
Our European Union , as a result of its history , is multicultural and multi@@ ethnic .
We think that because we have voted by a majority in the Council , everything is solved .
I , personally , imagined unacceptable interference in referenda on accession or on the adoption of the euro by a country , referenda associated with the right of each nation , and each nation alone , to self @-@ determination determination .
Finally , then , I would urge all Members to staunch@@ ly support the motion for a resolution that we have tabled today , which , I think , provides a balanced picture of Parliament &amp; apos ; s views on the situation in Tunisia .
As you know , this agreement goes well beyond objectives that are related purely to trade and cooperation .
It is becoming increasingly important to anticipate these ethical questions so that they can then be integrated into a broader dialogue between science and society .
In the midst of the ratification of a new text that includes all these provisions , this makes for a real muddle .
Second , I am convinced that this report constitutes the reward given by federalist Europe to the political and cultural establishment , which does not spare any effort in &amp; apos ; advancing &amp; apos ; the pro @-@ European European cause .
. In the minority opinion annexed to the Bourlanges report , I criticised , in particular , the proposal in paragraph 5 to allow the Treaties to be revised by majority vote , albeit an extremely qualified majority vote , instead of unanimously .
In future , by coordinating its diplomatic and military forces , the EU will be trying to optimise what its Member States have done individually throughout the last century .
That , in four weeks , things will get better ?
For my part , I had three particular concerns about this dossier .
They will , however , be voting against the Napolitano report .
In all honesty , I would not have done so .
However , countries such as Japan , Australia , Norway , China , Brazil and South Africa are making efforts that are commensurate with their responsibilities .
There is undoubtedly an un@@ balance there which sadd@@ ens us .
European enterprises must position themselves in the new markets and the EU must help them to grow by offering them legal certainty and by reinforcing their integration into the global economy .
Faced with so much hypocrisy and cynicism , we prefer to abstain .
On this matter , I might say - although I hope to address the issue after the recess , that the first two meetings of that new body gave rise to a new impetus .
I believe that this is an important point .
This was not proposed directly by the Commission , but we would stress our desire to ratify .
What decisions must the European Union take ?
Europe is committed to competition but Europe cannot be alone in the world in making it a cre@@ ed .
T@@ wel@@ ve years was chosen as the period in which to complete this considerable undertaking , which of course gives us until July 2003 .
We are attempting to establish what constitutes the proposal for a decision and what constitutes the motion for a resolution .
For the Mediterranean and for our fishermen , oy@@ ster farmers and shellfish breeders , Europe means restriction and pollution without compensation .
We are now at the end of a very eventful and stor@@ my period during which the Commission tarnished its image and lost its credibility .
What type of cooperation is the Commission talking about ?
It is now time to turn words into deeds , vision into action .
I therefore call on you now to adopt this report .
For our part , with regard to this dossier , we are awaiting clarification from the Commission and , above all , from the US authorities on a number of points .
Within the scope of the precautionary principle in health matters , the European Union must therefore defend the application of the entitlement to compulsory licences in the Millennium Round
Others are demanding reciprocal market access , even though this contradicts the very notion of the large market and sti@@ rs up ill @-@ feeling feeling .
As a result - probably one of the worse results - of this unanimous vote .
Little or no consideration has been given to social and environmental rules , to small @-@ scale scale farming , to the pe@@ asant farmers of the South who are very threatened by the agreements , to the small farmers of the North or to the interests of small and medium @-@ sized sized farms .
The financial system , in fact , is experiencing a lasting and fundamental crisis of confidence , and entire ch@@ un@@ ks of its architecture must be reconsidered .
We must , therefore , think about this issue of the second pillar without , of course , cutting off the first .
At the same time , it is a question of - and I quote these conclusions - facilitating the choice of instrument ( s ) , in the framework of the Euratom Treaty , that can contribute more effectively to achieving nuclear safety and the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste , without excluding any instrument and in line with the principles of better law @-@ making making .
Mr President , I would like to make reference to the principle whereby Parliament defends democracy and the rules of the constitutional state .
As I speak to you , at 5.@@ 15 p.m. , I have just managed to finalise a handful of compromise amendments incorporating the key points from the amendments that were tabled last week . These seem to offer a good basis for a consensus among most of the groups and to anticipate the bulk of the compromises that will have to be made with the Council .
I think that this is a question of logic , and today I really want to thank all those who have chosen to build Europe and to move forward .
Finally , truly fair treatment would entail equal access to public sector jobs , and equal wages and social rights , as well as to European citizenship based on residence and not on nationality , with , consequently , the right to vote and the eligibility of immigrants that are third @-@ country country nationals .
We would like the agency to inform Parliament of the actions taken and the improvements made , and we call on the Court of Auditors to conduct a specific audit on the implementation of the European Police College &amp; apos ; s action plan .
It also concerns the European Parliament and Commission in equal measure , as they have the same interest in ensuring that the three institutions work well , and are efficient and coherent .
Let us therefore be attentive to this aspect .
This treaty provides for a two @-@ speed speed Europe as far the budget and politics are concerned . It heral@@ ds a Europe where some will be more equal than others .
This framework decision is based on the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Be@@ ings , but it goes further .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , I am delighted at the clear and courageous statements that have been made by the Luxembourg Presidency with regard to sustainable development policy .
Commissioner , I would like to finish with a simple idea .
But some of the accused are still facing the death penalty and the others face heavy sentences .
These directions were overall approved by Parliament and the Council , but a disagreement arose regarding the amount of appropriations .
Finally , my seventh point , we are paying close attention to the international aspect , which is not just a question of competition with the United States or Japan and which must take account of the candidate countries and the cooperation programmes with the developing countries and the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean countries .
Commissioner , this debate is due to the initiative of the European Parliament and it was born out of our desire to respond positively to your consultation .
I am pleased , in this respect , with the conclusions the report presented by Mr Seppänen on the EIB special action programme in support of the consolidation and intensification of the EC @-@ Turkey Turkey customs union .
This report also highlights the discriminatory system which , from the earliest age , forces women into a marginalised and sub@@ ser@@ vient role .
As for the Council , I am inclined to tell it to rationalise the instruments available to the EU : the Cardiff process on the integration of environmental aspects into other policies , the Gothenburg sustainable development strategy and the recently revised Lisbon Strategy .
That brings me to the Structural Funds .
The Commission , as you know , would like to change them , but the Council has decided otherwise and up to now , when it comes to amending the Treaty , it is the governments of the Member States who take the decision .
- to make the aid complementary to the other financial instruments of EU development policy ,
Madam President , yesterday I submitted an oral question to the Commission and received a note from Parliament &amp; apos ; s Secretariat informing me that the Commissioner was going to answer my question this afternoon .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for my part I am not satisfied with either the form or the substance of this compromise text .
That is why , Commissioner , I think that a major communication campaign is needed in all EU Member States , and perhaps even in Croatia itself , to explain all the work that has been achieved , that all the chapters are well respected and that serious preparations have been made for this accession .
Is the European Parliament , the all @-@ round round world champion in promoting and demanding transparency and democratic control on the international stage , going to go back on what it has said and done and make an exception of the nuclear issue ?
The support of Parliament , together with that of the Council , was crucial to the successful conclusion of that legislative process .
I feel that it is a sensible position and that we need it urgently .
Our economic strength , our independence , our future , and above all our employment and unemployment rate depend on that .
It is more than desirable that the EU should adopt a clear and public position on this draft .
As far as the composition of the new Human Rights Commission for 2002 is concerned , we shall have to consult continuously with our traditional partners .
I believe this shows dis@@ respect for the MEPs .
They must be asked to participate fully in a better application of the principle of subsidiarity .
Our Committee on Budgets , for its part , has proposed an allocation of EUR 5.@@ 5 million covering the period from 2004 to 2008 .
After the vote on Amendment No 5
( Lau@@ ghter .
We believe that we must urgently block the liberalisation process and re @-@ appropriate appropriate public services by freeing them from the markets .
The European dream is about a continent with common values building itself into a political power .
Today we must improve the contents of Europeana while ensuring respect for intellectual property .
Thank you , Mr President . I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for the commitment of those Members who openly support our action and are willing to further a new policy which will , of necessity , be innovative .
I shall therefore explain in detail the Commission &amp; quot ; s position on the amendments .
The equilibrium of the societies of Europe rests in large part on the preservation and development of a culture composed of diversity , on the vitality of our remarkably rich languages and , as a corollary , on the rejection of uniformity .
Subject to the following remarks , I voted in favour of the Dan@@ j@@ ean report .
I have just one regret , which I know is shared by many people in Parliament , particularly my fellow Members in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance . It is the fact that the implementation of a text with such a big impact on the freedoms of European citizens is not subject to the full jurisdictional control of the Court of Justice .
We are aware , for we have already discussed this , of the seriousness of the situation in some countries within the Union , particularly in Belgium .
The Commission position is not to set a target date for accession before the accession negotiations are at the stage of being concluded .
You tell us there is resistance within the European Council , but do you really need to await orders from the finance ministers to set up a deposit guarantee scheme or to look at how accounting standards will be applied at European level ?
I do not understand why it is up to the US to decide who must be part of Europe .
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force .
I also wish to acknowledge their struggle , because it is as a result of that struggle that we in this Parliament are able to work ; as a result of their tireless fight for democracy , for the rule of law , for freedom and also for national reconciliation in their country .
Sup@@ pose@@ dly on the grounds of environmental protection , the Commission is proposing reducing the fishing fleet and encouraging the use of more powerful fishing gear , over and above the use of less powerful gear . This will reduce the number of artisanal fishermen .
Once everyone th@@ row@@ s their weight behind this task at local , regional , national and European levels , only then can we effectively fight unemployment .
The report aims to sum up the reality of the freedom to move and reside in the European Union .
In its document on the broad economic guidelines , the Commission pursues this liberal approach , and these guidelines now represent the reference text for the coordination of economic policy in the Member States .
Finally , as regards the import of American poultry treated with chlor@@ inated water , the wording in the text is too ambiguous .
In this connection , too , the French Presidency hopes that this issue can be incorporated into the Commission &amp; apos ; s future legislative programme , Mr Barrot .
The message is clear and research into vehicle technologies will certainly have to be one of the priorities of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology .
I hope that the text of this report , which we have drawn up with all the rapporteurs and which we shall be presenting tomorrow to our other fellow Members , will be a great step forward for workers from third countries .
We shall vote for this principle .
The fish farms concerned must be assisted in &amp; apos ; cleaning up &amp; apos ; the infected site and preventing the disease from spreading through the commercial transport of live fish .
Italy has a constitution and case @-@ law law that prohibits it from ex@@ tradi@@ ting anyone to a country that still has the death penalty .
For the next six months , you will hold the Presidency of the Council , and many challenges await you .
Mr President , something very simple is going to happen for our European Parliament with the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon ; we are going to have another 18 MEPs from 12 Member States of the European Union .
My group is divided on the matter .
It consists in fact of re@@ organising the Treaties by separating the basic texts on the one hand and the implementing provisions on the other .
Furthermore , the European Union is founded on un@@ ass@@ ail@@ able values which include combating all forms of discrimination , and I will work to uphold this value throughout my term of office .
On behalf of the Commission , I express my firm belief that this agreement represents another step forward in the collaboration between our institutions on the construction of Europe .
Finally , the Commission is ready to present to the European Council a roadmap setting out the path to a modern Europe capable of delivering economic prosperity and social justice .
One can but welcome the ambitious objective which you have set , within the ten @-@ year year strategy you propose , of lifting the taboo on the notion of full employment in the European Union , and of providing us with the means to do so by setting a quantified target of 3 % growth .
We must propose ways out of the situation in order to create a conditions which might form a basis for imag@@ ining the integration of these countries into the European Union .
. Mr Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , I warmly thank Mrs Prets for the work she has done , and I will be voting in favour of her report .
Parliament should equip itself with far more stringent rules of procedure and abide by them .
The second is the restoration of constitutional legality and the resumption of pluralist dialogue involving all parties , including of course the opposition parties .
The Commission is therefore in favour of a more detailed examination of these issues , if necessary by conducting a proper study , and the European Parliament will obviously be involved in this process .
I should like , however , to make two comments .
Given these conditions , the report should have been referred back to committee .
In this context , I support the idea of providing aid to developing countries which will enable them to ensure respect for the environment .
If we allowed ordinary plenary part @-@ sessions sessions to be cut by one day , the rules could be stret@@ ched even further , with the result that Strasbourg would gradually no longer be the location for plenary part @-@ session session work .
Europe also needs to have a real European policy on investment and to introduce a public loan at Union level .
Madam President , over a year ago I spoke in this House to expose the flagrant disregard for human rights in Chad , a country marked by thirty years of war and aggression .
In its report dated 4 February 2010 , Amnesty International shows that parliamentarians , sen@@ ators , lawyers , leaders of the opposition and journalists have been subject to arrest and arbitrary and illegal detention and that some were mis@@ treated during their arrest , while the authorities have not conducted any enquiries .
Europe must invest more in its human capital , more in research and more in its physical infrastructure .
Mr President , I would like to respond succinc@@ tly to the various Members who have spoken , by saying that I hope that next Thursday &amp; apos ; s debate will be more in @-@ depth depth .
There is a clear need to harmonise the rules here in order to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union .
I shall end on two points : first , I am very happy that economic and social rights are assessed at European level and I believe this Convention should take inspiration from that .
This considerable rapprochement of ideas on both sides of the Atlantic can only benefit dialogue , Mr President , particularly within the framework of the WTO .
Madam President , it is always a difficult task to strike a fair balance between the necessary level of copyright protection and protecting everyone &amp; apos ; s right to knowledge and learning .
It does away with the unjustified protectionist obstacles , while permitting the Member States to apply their national rules when the public interest warrants it .
Firstly , because the chief target of this new round of negotiations is indeed sustainable development and this is primarily of concern to developing countries .
Therefore , I am inclined to share Mr Hutchinson &amp; apos ; s view , although I do regret somewhat that this debate is taking place here and now .
As has been shown in a large number of studies , the rules of origin are a necessary condition for access to trade preferences .
We condemned such strikes in Iraq , and we condemn them in this case .
Finally , in terms of regulation , in the absence of standardised European rules , strict harmonisation of air traffic control and restrictions must be achieved in order to prevent dumping within the Union , a phenomenon familiar to us , which is governed by decisions taken simply at local level .
We must , however , set an example and our partners must do the same .
It was under her Presidency a year ago that we adopted these objectives , and I hope that we are not now going to water down our ambitions .
Mr President , the Group of the European Radical Alliance is rarely prodi@@ gal with its compliments . Nevertheless , this time I think the author of this report should be most warmly congratulated .
There is one example that has a direct bearing on what happened in Ireland . At the summit , the states con@@ co@@ c@@ ted , at break@@ nec@@ k speed , a defence Europe with im@@ precisely defined missions and which public opinion , in general , regards as unlikely to be independent .
The European Commission itself has been obliged to acknowledge that since the implementation of Customs Union , no significant progress has been made in Turkey in the field of human rights and democratic reform .
What we should have done was either to give up all participation by Parliament , or reverse the procedures and give Parliament the last word .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , now that my fellow Members have reminded us of the somewhat difficult progress of this excellent initiative , we hope that it will start to take a more concrete form .
There are , of course , a number of differences as to emphasis ; where should the emphasis be placed ?
It should be recalled that a few years ago , the United States was not really participating in the process but they are now committed to the negotiations .
On the other hand , given the exceptional nature of the disaster that has hit these regions , the European Union , in cooperation with the Member States , must take action on a much greater scale and more quickly , not least by harn@@ essing the European Solidarity Fund , and it must do so in a more flexible manner than the one you have certainly just described , Commissioner .
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this .
Finally , although the Council of Ministers has ignored the vote of Parliament at the first reading quite scandal@@ ously , we wanted to present some conciliatory amendments , in particular regarding quotas and new services .
Following the resignation of the European Commission , the three institutions , the European Parliament , the European Commission and the Council signed an interinstitutional agreement intended to specify the procedures for the implementation of the administrative inquiries of the European anti @-@ fraud fraud unit ( OLAF ) .
I would emphasise that this whole process has been carried out with full cooperation and perfect agreement between the Council in general , the High Representative , the Commission , and particularly , Commissioner Patten .
This is how it should be . These are critical decisions im@@ pac@@ ting on the life of every European .
But it was in no sense the end of a process .
Mr President , last week I was in Ar@@ gentina with the Mercosur delegation .
I observed the emphasis that was placed , in particular , on external policy , on communication , and on subjects relating to financial regulation and to the euro .
I am thinking in the very first place of Palestine .
The pollutants em@@ itted depend both on the nature of the waste to be treated and the technologies used to treat this waste .
The Commission is now as good as in place , but it has had an easy start compared with what is to come .
Basically , the request that we are going to examine to change the agenda is slightly paradoxical , because the entire strategy carried out by the rapporteurs and the Commission was aimed at having a joint debate on those two texts : the policy of the Central Bank and the information and communication strategy regarding the euro .
the report by Mr Busuttil , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mau@@ ri@@ ti@@ us on the short @-@ stay stay visa waiver - C7 @-@ 0015 0015 / 2009 - ,
This clause would require the regular publication of reports deta@@ iling the social and environmental impact of each undertaking &amp; apos ; s activities , taking into account all subsidiaries and the supply chain .
However , it is difficult to go further in the framework of the Dublin Regulation , as this regulation , Mrs H@@ enn@@ is@@ Plasschaert , cannot be an instrument as such for the distribution of asylum seekers among Member States .
A policy of information and communication should therefore accompany such measures to convince the Polish people of the advantages of joining the European Union .
However , in addition to this purely technical aspect , which is in itself not a negligible one , I refuse , for serious political reasons , to see a day ( whether Monday or Friday ) ch@@ op@@ ped off the Strasbourg sessions , while at the same time the number and length of extraordinary sessions in Brussels are being im@@ properly increased .
As you will have appreciated , we are therefore disappointed and above all worried .
The adoption of a common position on the draft regulation is , for the French Presidency , one of the major steps towards increasing personal mobility within the Union .
The great majority of Parliament is of this opinion .
The Joint Research Centre and its specialist role have been stressed , and the goal of 3 % of GDP is , I believe , an ambitious but necessary goal in all Member States .
We trust that it is very important that for the institution which is issuing a currency for 16 states that are united in Europe , but are still sovereign states , it is better that it is the Governing Council as a whole which appears to be the pertinent entity in terms of our decision .
The state of the dairy market has worsened considerably over the last 12 months : the price of milk has fallen by 30 % in a year , which is the shar@@ p@@ est fall seen in the last 20 years .
. Mr President , the subcommittee decided this year to change the structure of the annual report on human rights .
Dialogue , negotiation and peaceful resolution to commercial conflicts have made international trade a laboratory for international governance , where each partner participates in decision @-@ making making .
Not only do forest fires contribute to climate change as a result of massive CO2 emissions , they also gradually reduce the size of our forests and the Union &amp; quot ; s carbon sink capacities .
It will have a crucially important role to play in char@@ ting our course over the next 20 or 30 years .
I am voting against this report .
The quality of the marine ecosystem plays a fundamental role in the planet &amp; apos ; s global environment and , in particular , plays a very important role in regulating the climate .
These three elements enable us to control catches and to guarantee the continu@@ ance of the various fish stocks .
In the name of the war against terrorism , they are waging war against democratic freedoms and the social acquis .
That is why I do not think it is wise , and I think it could even be dangerous , to envisage a framework directive where we stick to this approach .
We must also adopt a coherent position .
It was in this spirit that I offered in my political guidelines presented to you a special relationship with Parliament .
This , in reality , ex@@ poses the true intentions behind the report &amp; apos ; s mol@@ lif@@ ying proposals : the idea is , in effect , no more and no less , to take away from the national parliaments the exclusive right of ratifying European Treaties and , therefore , of defining the competences of the European Union themselves .
Several thousand people die each year in Europe because they have been unable to receive a transplantation in time .
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision , as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive .
Moreover , our cultural and historical links with them mean that we must support and cooperate closely with them .
This is evidence that even today there is a hidden policy to promote nuclear power , which is no longer tolerable , in my opinion .
I repeat that animal production has a very important place in European agriculture , and production conditions must not be imposed on producers which render them no longer competitive with imported products from third countries which do not comply with the same conditions or constraints .
But what will happen in the future ?
Nevertheless , I would like to stress the importance of three points .
Although this approach and this collabor@@ ative work are constructive , we have nonetheless occasionally had to wait , and in some instances we are still waiting , for the detailed requests , and indeed the additional information required in order to adopt a position and draw up our own proposals .
Without wanting to anticipate this debate , let me briefly expand on the key issues of these forthcoming summits .
These points lead me to conclude that my group will not be able to support the Oostlander report .
The second programme comprises support for the South African Government &amp; apos ; s Comprehensive HIV / Aids C@@ are Management and T@@ reat@@ ment Plan , amounting to EUR 25 million .
Moreover , it has been unanimously approved by the Committee on the Environment , and I feel that it is essential that Parliament votes in favour of it .
In your country , Mr Bonde , like everywhere else , I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people .
I think that this , too , is a very strong symbol .
As you are well aware , the Commission - in common with Parliament - requested that the social chapter should be integrated into the Treaty at the intergovernmental conference .
We are working on an important report , so at least have the decency to listen to people or leave the Chamber .
There is reason to believe that the euro will go into circulation , that the timetable will be respected , that the number of countries participating in EMU from the outset will be large , as countries such as Spain and Italy , which were a cause for concern , will very probably be members of the leading group .
The first is related to the need to define , codify and validate , through democratic consultation , the nature of the contract between the Union and its citizens , on the basis of the European social model and the values we hold dear .
This , indeed , is the message of the Commission &amp; quot ; s spring report and of the interim report .
To that end , it stipulates that the Community will promote social dialogue and social protection .
With that in mind , all the Member States will have to take global , integrated and inter @-@ pillar pillar action .
However , I am well aware of the risks that it involves and they must be eliminated or contained .
We are willing to make progress in this respect and to draw up a framework agreement or even a set of guiding principles for adoption in Cancun in order to ensure that greater attention is paid to these questions which - let me repeat - are important for the developing countries .
I find that particularly regrettable given that the report on which we are voting does not include my amendment and that some ar@@ can@@ e procedure has prevented me from putting it forward again in plenary .
We call for the creation of a proper agency to provide the necessary coordination .
I welcome the work carried out , which will also have made it possible to put in place tools committing agriculture to move towards more sustainable development , while taking into account the objectives of food security , the environment , territories and jobs .
We regret that .
Unlike the 11 other European countries affected by this reform , which anticipated the election and which have of course relied on the results of the European elections of June 2009 , the French Government , for its part , has decided to simply appoint members from its national parliament : this is a disgrace to democracy .
We cannot expect to keep on exporting our products to India while stopping imports of Indian products into our countries .
I would say no ; I would say that we need to avoid two traps .
We do not believe that Europe has a future as a low @-@ cost cost competi@@ tor .
The on @-@ screen screen violence of all kinds to which children are subjected , whether it be on television or through the computer , has short@@ - , medium- and long @-@ term term consequences .
This dialogue and these debates are necessary because we know that , without them , we will not have your support .
I should also like to make the point clear to Mrs Wallis : this should affect all European citizens , but we should also ensure that we create the conditions for real mutual confidence to be established .
We have to admit that it is sometimes tempting to resolve this or that problem by creating an agency ; together we need to be able to resist this temptation .
Meanwhile , our group will do its best to ensure that the Commission has a text ready within the agreed timeframe .
N@@ ation@@ als of certain high @-@ risk risk countries are virtually excluded from the protection of the Geneva Convention because of a restrictive interpretation of the definition of the term refugee , which incidentally is supported by a common position recently adopted by the Council .
We call on the US Government to do so , as we believe this is essential in resolving this dispute .
I should like to congratulate Prime Minister Fischer and his predecessor , Mi@@ rek Topolánek , on the results obtained during a particularly difficult phase .
The third point concerns structural indicators on sustainable development which will be , on the basis of a Commission communication , endorsed by the Council before being submitted to the Laeken European Council .
The European Union must associate itself with this ; its vocation and its interest require it to be present wherever peace and democracy must be consolidated .
It is well known that , with the introduction of the euro , the Member States will lose two courses of action in their economic policy : the manipulation of exchange rates and monetary policy .
At the meeting , the Commission gave an undertaking - and I believe that we should stick to this line - to propose a draft text on this subject during the course of the year .
I do not feel the Commission and the Council can fail to respond to an event of such seriousness .
This line was sacrificed at the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
In order to achieve this high level of protection , it is therefore vital to involve representative consumer organisations in drawing up both Community and international policies .
However , I believe the time has now come to review its structure and also to propose a new strategy that takes full account of the coordination of macro @-@ economic economic , social and employment policies .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if there is one area in which all Europeans expect effective Community responses , it is that of large @-@ scale scale natural disasters .
He reminded us very clearly in his introductory remarks that we are not there yet , that we still have a very long way to go .
Madam President , I will be quick as I only have one minute in which to express my disappointment at seeing that , in this Chamber , our Parliament has chosen carefully to avoid &amp; apos ; speaking the truth &amp; quot ; .
Our position must be reaffirmed ; the Union is in no position to integrate Turkey , but must implement a privileged partnership with this country , which is crucial to Europe .
May I take this opportunity to wish you a Happ@@ y Christmas and to thank you for the quality of our joint efforts throughout 2000 .
It would also show that Europe is a real force in terms of fair play , sport for all , and sport for the citizen .
I think the stepping up of the negotiations has been widely welcomed and at the next General Affairs Council , and then at the European Council , we will be able to adopt a clear and ambitious line for the continuation of the discussions on the basis of the principles set in Helsinki , which should lead directly to the desired outcome .
Finally , how can we fail to keep the commitments made previously when we are trying to integrate these states into the European Union and to ask for their full solidarity ?
We will not vote for Amendment No 12 on the burden of proof as it is ambiguous .
Regarding social policy , we have a famous debate .
It should also be pointed out that the Commission should not be a spectator , but play an active public role in managing steel at European Union level .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a priority debate on cohesion policy is rare , and today &amp; apos ; s one is extremely important .
The regulatory framework that we are establishing today should be able to improve the conditions in which these ratings are prepared , provided they are used in a supervisory framework for regulated activities .
However , 27 of the amendments tabled by your rapporteur cannot be taken over as they stand and would need to be discussed in more detail .
I support the proposal contained in the resolution which seeks to include the right to lifelong training in the Charter of Fundamental Rights !
It would therefore be necessary to continue the preparations in progress at Geneva , particularly our process of alliance moving towards broader negotiations .
In this difficult context , the European Union and its businesses have a substantial social responsibility in the relations they maintain with third countries .
The priority today is to achieve a reduction in the intensity of fishing activity in order to allow stocks to replen@@ ish .
A new financial regulation has been decided on , by a vote in the European Parliament .
What market regulation mechanism can be used to limit sudden increases and , above all , sudden price falls ?
If this is not the case , it shows that the European Commission , who considers banning premature and unjustified , has failed in its responsibility to defend consumer interests and is penalising European producers .
Our concern relates to education , training and research , as well as a culture of innovation and science , which must hold pride of place once more within the European Union .
Indeed , Syria , Yemen and Bah@@ rain are countries with which we have no agreements besides trade agreements , which do not , for example , contain clauses on human rights , and we have very few levers available to us .
Nonetheless , it would be advisable for health policy in Europe to be developed by the two co @-@ legislators legislators , i.e. you and us , as the outcome of a political dialogue and a democratic process .
I do not wish to indulge in what some would consider an example of our mutual admiration society , which would strike me as somewhat excessive , but at the moment when you have decided to leave this House - to which you have brought a great deal , both as a Member and as its President , although we have dis@@ agreed on a number of points , which is part and parcel of a democratic chamber - I wish to bear witness to the high regard in which you are held within our group and to express our recognition for the way in which you have dealt with people who represent a minority in this House .
I would like to know why your entourage , why your services , why your staff are so unwilling to push this procedural matter forward , on a question of whose importance for the image of our Parliament you are well aware .
We have had a lot of discussion in this House of the various measures in favour of maritime security and , Commissioner , you have put forward rational proposals .
The European Parliament is an institution in its own right . The ACP group does not have an existence outside its appearance at the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and does not have an organisation in the form of political groups .
We are more aware in Europe than elsewhere that this is unacceptable , because we are obliged to guarantee our fellow citizens the real choice of whether to eat or whether to refuse to eat GMOs .
As you know , a delegation of elected representatives from Northern Cyprus will be visiting the European Parliament on Thursday , and that will be an opportunity to express our deep concern about these matters .
Such objectives can be achieved only through the completion of the internal market .
I am sorry that this is complicated , but life sometimes is complicated .
Mr President , I think this is a particularly important debate , following the cas@@ ting of 118 votes in favour of c@@ ensuring the Commission on a very closely related subject .
I therefore consider that we have some very important work ahead of us . With the resources at our disposal today , we have no option but to continue our discussions , and to try to persuade Member States to adopt a common definition , but I repeat , we do not have any means of compelling them to do so .
For me , fighting racism also means creating a political Europe and democracy at European level .
The institutional question has been resolved .
Moreover , it seems to me that in order to update these directives properly three objectives have to be achieved .
It is , in actual fact , the responsibility of the Member States first and foremost and of your Parliament to decide upon them , since the financial perspectives are not only decided upon in the Council .
It falls to us to ensure that preparations are made in the best possible circumstances , and this summit should provide an opportunity for the partnership between China and the European Union to address new issues , in particular those relating to action against climate change and to environmental and social standards - as many of you have said .
What has been the result on the ground of the measures already taken ?
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , Commissioners , honourable Members , on behalf of the Council , allow me to thank the Parliamentary rapporteurs who have invested so much effort working on the various dossiers needed to implement the European External Action Service : Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini for the Financial Regulation , Mr Rapkay for the Sta@@ ff Regulations and Mr Gu@@ al@@ ti@@ er@@ i and Mr Surján for the Draft amending budget 2010 .
The ECB therefore attaches the utmost importance to holding regular dialogues with the elected representatives of the European citizens .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , following the Berlin Agreement , and the interinstitutional agreement , it was mandatory to review the system of own resources of the European Union in order to weight the shares of each Member State correctly .
If the European institutions wish to continue playing an active role in the fight against sex discrimination , they should start by giving an example in the treatment reserved to their officials and agents .
On the other hand , I am in favour of the oral amendment that will be tabled by Mrs Berès during the vote on the legislative resolution .
But I want you to know that our dialogue will be difficult .
On this subject , I would like to say something quite different to my colleague Mr Harbour .
That is my first answer .
Since its inception , the European Union has sought to bring peoples closer together .
It is a necessary step , but it does not go far enough .
We must also work together towards the adoption of a set of legislative proposals that will give effect to the interinstitutional agreement , once it has been adopted .
Although Europe has a large medicines market , it also fortunately has a great scientific and industrial tradition : something known as good manufacturing practice , a notion which must be preserved .
Our coastal zones have been in continual decline for many years now , and the efforts of Member States to tackle this phenomenon vary according to the policies that the governments decide to pursue .
It is therefore the United States that is being challenged on this point .
On the other hand , since you have reported on the satisfactory resolutions of the Council with regard to transparency , we are surprised that we have not heard anything of the letter that Chancellor Kohl sent you , Mr Blair , on his interpretation of the new Article 63 of the Amsterdam Treaty relating to the community @-@ wide wide adoption of the immigration policy .
On a subject as important as this , petty manoeuvring should not be acceptable .
Madam President , we see , as the Commission recalls in its communication , the essential importance of SMEs in the European Union .
It is certain that , within those institutions , it is necessary to take better account of new balances of power in the world , and to integrate better a number of new international players , new economic powers , without forgetting the developing countries .
Secondly , a protocol specially devoted to reaffirming competition policy has been adopted by the European Council itself and will be included in the final text .
This is why the economic impact of the regulations required , namely , legislation on animal welfare , must be assessed and incorporated into long @-@ term term planning for the future of the agricultural sector and the livestock sector in particular .
The European Commission must urgently review the fourth and seventh Company Law Directives , which alone can provide a comprehensive , fair and consistent solution .
What measures does the Commission intend to adopt in order to ensure that the European Convention on Human Rights , the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights , and in particular Article 4 thereof , are properly upheld throughout the territory of the European Union ?
It is therefore the responsibility of the European Parliament to shake up the Council and the Commission .
Indeed , the European Commission , responsible for negotiating this agreement , seems to want all services to be included , in principle .
In the context of negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework , the budget for this reshap@@ ed cohesion policy should remain the same .
The activities that the EU will support in 2007 and the awareness and demonstration campaigns are a step in the right direction .
Several Member States have said that they were considering support measures for certain sectors of industry .
This issue cannot be dealt with by the committee procedure , because that would exclude Members of the European Parliament from the debate and prevent them from making proposals on this subject .
As regards the creation of an area of peace and stability , the European Union does not carry much political clout , despite the fact that in the countries of the South there is a genuine demand for Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the interpreters for being here in greater numbers than us to translate this very important debate which is being held at such a late hour . Yes , Mr Pas@@ qua , you will have the right to speak .
Far from moving us away from this goal , the Georgian conflict must , on the contrary , strengthen it in the context , once again , of what the European Union &amp; apos ; s identity represents with respect to other partners who may not always have the same interests as ours in their relations with Russia .
With regard to regional strategy , the European Union believes there can be no lasting peace in Afghanistan unless a regional approach is taken .
The draft resolution reflects this wish , this requirement , by asking the Commission to provide yet more information in the annual report .
I have reminded the Member States of the obligation to respect fundamental rights when they transpose the Directive on the return of illegal immigrants , and I shall be monitoring this .
But all is not lost , for sooner or later , when the revolutionary forces come to power , a referendum will give a voice back to the people to confirm the superiority of French law over the European treaties .
I would also like to mention the report on sustainable development that was produced as part of our work on the action plans which are now being implemented by the ACP countries .
I wanted to point out once again that the independence of the Central Bank is a fundamental principle of Economic and Monetary Union , that the independence of the Central Bank is part of the Pact on which Economic and Monetary Union is founded , that , in the work leading up to the constitutional treaty and the subsequent reforming Treaty of Lisbon , no government suggested even so much as a minor change to the general terms of reference of Central Bank , which focus on price stability .
Ladies and gentlemen , this morning , the members of the PPE Group are calling for an ambitious view of Europe .
With this fat@@ eful date now approaching , the Commission conf@@ esses that nothing is ready and the obligation cannot be applied for another year .
If that is indeed our wish and we act accordingly , we must accept the consequences .
Are we having an impact ?
Mr President , I would like to begin by warmly thanking Mrs Carlotti for her excellent work , the approach of which I support fully .
Apart from the need to establish balanced trade , you must , Commissioner , help to boost the competitiveness of our European companies .
Commissioner , on behalf of Parliament , as it is the last night sitting , please believe me when I say that we have been very aware of the excellence of our reports throughout this parliamentary term .
Mr President , while the tanks were threatening Tbil@@ isi and the French Presidency was ush@@ ering Europe into the role of peacem@@ aker , a role that it ought never to have abandoned , I re @-@ read read a Hungarian author , S@@ án@@ dor M@@ á@@ rai .
Contrary to my political group &amp; apos ; s decision and to that of the majority of the European Parliament , I have voted against compromise Amendments Nos 44 and 45 , concluded with the Council .
The second proposal is that of Mr Savary , which I know has been unanimously supported by the committee .
It is time for a debate and a decision on the subject , which must be positive , humane and responsible .
The issue of Parliament &amp; apos ; s expenditure also interests me .
From this point of view it is important that the role of each party should be clear .
I dare to hope that I myself will be able to propose the nomination of this coordinator to the Commission very soon .
The harmonisation which will be thus achieved will also guarantee equitable competition conditions across the European Union , provided , as our rapporteur has stated , that actions are taken at a fiscal level to avoid distortions .
We are of course in favour of Bulgaria &amp; quot ; s and Romania &amp; quot ; s accession to the EU , although these countries still need assisting in their efforts , and we are also in favour of Croatia &amp; quot ; s accession , as it will send a strong signal to the Balkans .
What sense would it make to have a directive on this subject that did not cover these Eurobonds even though , as we well know , they are the main form of activity for some of our Member States ?
This subject has been provoking controversy around the negotiating table for a long time now .
So the peoples of Europe risk once more being trapped by a European Union which is fulfilling the objective function of dem@@ ol@@ ishing their defence when it should be aiming to strengthen it .
It is by action and by the development of good policies through dialogue and cooperation that we will best be able to move the trans @-@ Atlantic Atlantic partnership forward .
It also begins , with reference to Hamas - and I say this with the utmost firmness - with putting a definitive end to the fir@@ ing of ro@@ ck@@ ets into Israel from Gaza .
As I mentioned , the Council is continuing to examine the Commission &amp; apos ; s legislative proposals on matters relating to the modulation of aid , market management mechanisms , milk quota management and conditionality .
Having said that , Mr President , I have to announce that my group will not be voting for the four amendments to this resolution , not because we do not share their concerns or agree with the content , but because we think another time should be found to express in a general manner Parliament &amp; apos ; s feelings on the issues raised .
The new priorities of the area of freedom , security and justice must , above all , enable all the European decisions adopted to date to be implemented .
I cannot help but think that the latter &amp; apos ; s fundamental aim is to prepare public opinion for the gradual privatisation of pension schemes .
This guarantee of equivalent effectiveness in terms of collection seems to me to be crucial for a flexible but non @-@ permis@@ sive permis@@ sive system .
The agreement of all the European progressives made it possible , initially , for the issue to be put at the top of the European political agenda , which is a good thing .
This , for France , is one of the many reasons why we reject the Amsterdam Treaty .
The first is that we need to determine whether or not the idea of definite arrangements based on the country of origin is still the aim of the European Union .
The results were presented in a communication in October 2007 , which also launched the second phase of the consultation .
The second difference concerns transparency . The European Parliament &amp; apos ; s report calls once again ( paragraph 14 ) for the minutes of the ECB Governing Council meetings to be published , together with a summary of the stance of both the approving and dissen@@ ting parties .
Its authority must be established , and we must help it to establish that authority and to ensure the subsistence of its population .
Perhaps the Council will not immediately support such a proposal , but given your record in this Chamber , you will , I am almost certain , be able to obtain support here in Parliament , which makes it worthwhile your continuing along these lines .
Next , and without wishing to be anti @-@ American American , I think that the people of Europe vagu@@ ely dis@@ like a single government deciding the priorities of the international calendar , however powerful this government considers itself to be .
Clearly , these issues are real , serious and tragic .
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , I am delighted that the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has made it possible to integrate into the final report a number of ideas that we wanted to see emerge .
However , deprivation engend@@ ers violence , and unless you wage war on poverty , poverty will wage war on you .
I would also like to underline my confidence in the positive influence the other ASEAN countries may have : in seeking greater integration they are in my opinion playing a not insignificant role in relation to human rights .
The amended wording of the two statements to be published in the Official Jour@@ n@@ al , has al@@ la@@ yed our fears , Mr President , and our group will fully support Mr Langen &amp; apos ; s excellent report .
On 15 June before the Feira Summit , the European Parliament passed a resolution , and tomorrow , on the eve of the Nice Council , it has to vote on a text summarising its position .
Vo@@ ting in favour of these things can only strengthen public confidence in a European market model that is both open and protective .
We are already seeing stor@@ my debates on whether it will be the CAP or cohesion policy that will be plundered .
It also favours applying the principle of subsidiarity , which would allow the Member States to apply zero VAT to services provided locally , such as catering or other aspects , as a solution to social , educational and cultural aims etc . It also seeks to maintain many derogations which should have termin@@ ated in 2007 until 2010 .
It is essential , then , to promote and encourage preventive screening methods , to inform women and aim prevention campaigns at them .
The obligation to take these aspects into consideration was already provided for by the case @-@ law law of the Court in accordance with the Treaty on European Union .
I am wondering how the urgent matters with which we deal here , in Parliament , are chosen .
This means that only democratically elected representatives , without exception , have the right to participate and to express their views within the Joint Parliamentary Assembly .
Mr President , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I agree , of course , with what Mr Brok said .
That situation would not , of course , be perfect and there would be obstacles to circumvent .
We must recognise that , since the 11 September attacks , there has been this fear of terrorism that has meant that , at times , the protection of rights , individual freedoms and privacy has been lost sight of and that we must , I believe , keep a close eye on this balance .
This is a hard task , we know , but the most important thing is that the European Union is engaging in it .
And I am not sure if this may not be the best outcome .
Certainly , we can and must understand the reaction of the Israeli Government , which cannot stand back and watch while terrorist attacks increase and its citizens are killed .
The Council first decided to resume a dialogue , without pre @-@ conditions conditions , between the European Union and Cuba , based on reciprocity and dealing with all issues of mutual interest .
On the one hand , Europe must encourage creative talents from a very young age , raise young people &amp; apos ; s awareness of culture , and develop partnerships between universities and companies .
Madam President , the three proposals for directives now before us are the Commission &amp; apos ; s response to the proceedings brought against it by Parliament in the European Court of Justice for its failure to act in the field of the free movement of persons within the European Union .
These proposals are not acceptable ; the need for cooperation within Europe is genuine , but also diverse and multi@@ form , and it can no longer be loc@@ ked into a uniform Community framework based on majority voting .
We shall therefore bring this point to the attention of the Turkish authorities , Mr Allister .
I note your concerns and I really hope that the next revision of the Treaty will offer a new framework , as well measures enabling the European Parliament to be fully involved in decisions on audiovisual policy .
I voted in favour of the resolution calling for the implementation of the Goldstone recommendations because it is vitally important to obtain a pledge from the Israeli and Palestinian authorities that they will carry out impartial and transparent investigations into the Gaza tragedy of 2008 @-@ 2009 2009 , not in an aggressive but in a determined way .
This is hardly surprising .
Ladies and gentlemen , when dealing with our international partners on such important challenges , we cannot allow ourselves to get caught up in un@@ productive divisions any longer .
I still think that modernity and social progress consist of making the focus of Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean relations human factors rather than goods and capital .
As for the legal basis , I would argue for a twin legal basis in order to guarantee respect for national competences .
The new strategy must promote fishing at local level , and I should like to point out that aquaculture is a significant part of this , as it accounts for a considerable amount of resources and tens of thousands of jobs .
The plan presented by the Commission unfairly penalises fishermen for whom cod is still a by @-@ catch catch .
( Parliament had no objections to the oral amendments )
Our competitiveness in the globalised economy is at stake .
Our interest therefore , Mr President , is to put a complete end to this very pernicious trend .
The Commission &amp; quot ; s formal proposals will be presented next year , once the debate on the three options has been held with the main parties concerned .
That is the spirit of my report , a spirit , moreover , that closely mirrors that of Mr Van Orden &amp; quot ; s report , and I think that , tomorrow , Parliament will be able to demonstrate its desire to take one more step towards accession on 1 January 2007 .
The socialist group is unanimous in this and unanimous in repeating it forcefully to the Council and the Commission .
Some , we know , are more advanced than others , and will be able , as of April , to commence concrete negotiations .
I should like to point out in this Chamber just how worthwhile it is , as was the case this year , for sessions organised in Europe to be held in the country holding the Presidency .
Providing aid to developing countries is one duty that the European Union must not abandon .
I am also proud of the contribution made by the Commission , which - as President Sarkozy said - has always worked hand in hand with the French Presidency and , furthermore , has always stressed that only a European response could have an impact at the required level .
The Nice Treaty , which is currently in the process of being approved , effectively complet@@ es the work while excluding them from negotiations touching on services and intellectual property .
Of course we supported and still support the agreement signed between Europol and the American police agencies on cooperation in the fight against terrorism .
The treaty in force is the Treaty of Nice .
The opinion delivered by our Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , contains a revealing phrase .
However , it also brings a challenge with it , that is , to reform the European common agricultural policy so as to adapt it to the requirements of the twenty @-@ first first century in order to guarantee a future for the European agricultural model in an increasingly globalised economy .
In this respect , the conclusions of the Doha conference must be taken into consideration , as you have just said , Commissioner , and we must not lose sight of the ongoing need to channel humanitarian aid and guarantee the safety of aid workers . Transpar@@ ent negotiations are a guarantee of two viable states , as are the cessation of violence and effective cooperation between the two states .
We must pass on to the younger generations the appropriate and considered actions and , of course , our generation must learn them too .
- I welcome the adoption by a virtually unanimous vote of the House of the resolution on the effects of the oil slick caused by the Erika . Our Group made a great contribution to drafting this resolution .
It wishes to establish close cooperation so that our three institutions can really offer each other mutual support .
The message is clear : international finance will be regulated for the benefit of the major countries only .
It is a summary of the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded , a summary that is recognised and that is included in Part II of the draft Constitution prepared by the Convention .
In more general terms , the Council invites the honourable Member to refer to developments in the Hague Programme , the multiannual programme adopted by the European Council at its meeting on 4 and 5 November 2004 .
Our resolution is singularly lacking in determination and it is to be feared that , unless widespread forces are mobilised , Social Europe will go unheeded on a long @-@ term term basis .
We must ensure that there is support for such activity as it plays an important role in preserving the fabric of rural society in a number of regions , such as in Alsace .
In its explanatory statement , the report calls on the Commission and Member States to show a greater commitment to culture .
It would , however , be of secondary importance in relation to the question that is of concern to you , but it is difficult for me to respond to this question at the moment , as it will relate to both the nature of the recommendations which will be made and also to finding the best possible compromise from an economic or any other point of view .
Where the rules are concerned , audiovisual content in the first category - that is to say , traditional radio and television broadcasting - needs to be subjected to a set of rules comparable to the current rules , but updated and simplified in order to take account of the developments I have mentioned .
Matters must be made clear , and I would insist very strongly on the following point : we refuse to be called troubl@@ em@@ akers .
This is a matter that has been discussed by your committee .
That is why we must use this dissuasive tool at Community level to ensure current regulations are applied , but also so that we are more effective in combating the organised networks which have made pollution their chosen new weapon .
We have no intention of imposing ourselves on activities which would benefit by being conducted at national level .
Such action is essentially pragmatic .
On the other hand , the next time Europe enlarges - probably to include Croatia in 2010 or 2011 if all goes according to plan - at that point , Mr President , we will need a new treaty in order to enlarge Europe with a new member .
I am also grateful to Mrs Gill for her comments , since her contribution makes this an extremely practical report .
I have also written to the Commission several times on this matter , but I regret to say that I have not received a satisfactory response .
Parliament has a real duty to guard against these things .
A number of other Community @-@ funded funded programmes also promote gender equality , and the social partners have a key role to play in supporting women &amp; quot ; s participation in the information society .
Firstly , what are the conditions for good coordination between the monetary policy which will from now on be conducted by the European Central Bank , under Parliament &amp; apos ; s supervision , and the economic policies of the different Member States ?
We have also proposed making the very important Brussels Convention of 1968 on J@@ ur@@ is@@ diction and the En@@ forcement of Ju@@ dg@@ ements in Civil and Comm@@ er@@ cial Matters into a regulation .
We must solemnly reaffirm today the right of all minorities to practise their religion freely and safely everywhere in the world , including here at home in Europe .
Certain shortcomings must , nevertheless , be mentioned .
Mr President , I must tell you that I am somewhat amazed .
Madam President , honourable Members , there is a significant convergence of opinion on the usefulness of and need for the ratification of the ILO conventions among speakers from the European Parliament and the Commission .
Today , another sector seemingly also wants to question or criticise the precaution being taken by the Member States and the European Council .
It cannot be content with the ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft role which it has been granted in the Committee of the Regions , a committee whose powers , as you know , are extremely limited .
This historic breakthrough , if it is confirmed in this House tomorrow , signals a victory for Europe as a partner , in other words for European institutions that have worked hand in hand with the Member States in a spirit of cooperation and with a strong common will to succeed .
I believe that Europe must prepare itself to take over a leadership role which the Americans are willing to transfer to us gradually .
I would merely like to remind you that some of the initial proposals of the rapporteur were not acceptable , nor were they in accordance with the measures of the Treaty .
It turns out , to our regret , that other countries are responsible for the block@@ ages .
Hi@@ therto , they have derived little benefit from the programmes proposed by the Commission .
However , throughout the Euro Zone , we have a duty to react to the crisis where economic policy is concerned .
We should also remember , ladies and gentlemen , that we have been forced to note shortcomings in the procedure for dialogue with the Commission , which seems not to have been able , or not to have wished , to respond to the expectations and questions of the members of the parliamentary supervisory body .
This bears no relation to the Europe of the general interest and of social equality that our peoples need .
It is for this reason that myself and Romano Prodi , since we are leaving for Canada together , must apologise for not being able to participate in the debate until the end .
Mr President , just a few words to say to Mr Lamy that I am not a self @-@ appointed appointed advocate of unanimity in all cases .
The twofold reform that has taken place , that of MEDA - now MEDA II - and the structural reform of external aid management , has been the source of many new and very promising initiatives , including the creation of the Europe@@ Aid Cooperation Office .
This House has already underlined the importance of this agreement by asking for the negotiations to be speeded up .
Contrary to the extreme position of a total ban , as first proposed by the rapporteur , the compromise we have reached now leaves Member States the option of providing an exception for professional and industrial use , but under clearly defined conditions .
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions .
I am referring , for example , to inventions of medicines .
Quite apart from our legislative work , there are certain great issues concerning civilisation with which we have to get to grips in order to raise at the European Council the issue of what sort of role the European Union should be playing on the global stage .
I did say that majority voting could be useful when safeguard measures were being taken , because in such cases all of the countries have to show solidarity .
We all know that their agriculture is un@@ competitive and not very diverse , with a majority of small@@ holdings needing their structures modernised , and that it requires us to look more deeply into a form of integrated agricultural policy , centred around food safety .
But it may also be the source of confrontation and social division .
We know that dissemination of GMOs results in pollution of traditional crops , which hind@@ ers the preservation of biodiversity .
Like the Commissioner , I would remind the House that n@@ ony@@ l@@ phen@@ ols and n@@ ony@@ l@@ phen@@ ol e@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ lates - I shall refer to them as N@@ PE@@ s to facilitate the discussion - are classified as substances which are highly toxic to aqu@@ atic organisms . These substances accu@@ mulate bi@@ ologically in aqu@@ atic species , and they have also been shown to have an endocr@@ ine @-@ disrup@@ ting disrup@@ ting effect .
Since 1989 , the conviction has been growing that this is an historic challenge , which must be met in order to secure our future - the future of all Europeans , inside and outside the Union .
Should we shift the emphasis away from budgetary consolidation , or even amend the stability pact ?
Mr President , the historical issue concerning the French Presidency , for I do feel that it is a historical issue , is first and foremost to open up the way for the construction of a Europe for all Europeans .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Mr President , the Conference of Presidents did not foresee this but obviously there is room for it on the agenda .
We shall welcome them , as friends .
Mr President , we all know that the WTO has a central role to play in the fair regulation of international trade relations .
Turkish citizens are realising that Turkey &amp; apos ; s accession to the EU will require not only the &amp; apos ; pain@@ less &amp; apos ; revision of their institutions but also a partial renunciation of sovereignty , to which they remain j@@ e@@ al@@ ously attached , and a radical change in habits and outlook .
Finally , now more than ever , I wish to point out that asylum seekers and those who require international protection are vulnerable and , as such , must be given very special attention .
Tal@@ ks are still going on about the initiatives to be taken by the European Union at the Commission on Human Rights this year .
There can be no prosperous and peaceful Europe if unemployment and poverty continue to spread .
Over many years - since 19@@ 71 to be precise - this regulation has been amended considerably in order to take as much account as possible of changes in national legislation , to improve certain provisions and to fill the gaps that still exist .
We now know that we may have two options : either indirectly , by improving the prerogatives of each national parliament in each of the Member States , or directly , by introducing new procedures to enable the national parliaments to intervene more directly in the European decision @-@ making making process .
Enlargement is enabling us to revive the geographical , political and cultural identity of Europe .
Finally , in the past few years , it has really become human trafficking : clandestine workers , pro@@ stitu@@ tes and sl@@ aves , as we see in their hundreds in the streets of all our capital cities .
I shall therefore answer you by stating the European Commission &amp; apos ; s intentions , whilst stressing the twofold concern , the twofold demand that we must address , or rather that we must all address together .
Obviously , as the honourable Member rightly says , these rules need to be supplemented and reinforced and the Commission will , I hope , table some proposals as quickly as possible .
At the same time , we must boost Europe &amp; quot ; s research and development spending to 3 % of GDP by 2010 .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr E@@ ppink &amp; apos ; s report is quite remarkable , but I am a little afraid - and this has nothing to do with the rapporteur - that we are making the same points over and over again .
Two points are crucial : the method of production and consumer confidence towards products thanks to traceability from the breeding farms to the consumer &amp; apos ; s plate .
The resolution that we are tabling today is clearly intended as an effective contribution to the objective of ending the situation that exists in the border areas .
As you know , however , this pre @-@ accession accession aid will be more particularly intended to help Turkey achieve the objectives laid down in the future accession partnership agreement .
The Union is trying to equip itself with the right foreign policy tools ( appointment of a High Representative , creation of the European External Action Service ) .
Let us be realistic and try to predict their next move .
Ladies and gentlemen , I personally am convinced that such a debate is appropriate and necessary , for globalisation raises a number of questions to which the liberalisation of trade cannot alone provide the answers .
Following the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities in this , Parliament is anxious to show that , and I quote , &amp; quot ; European parliamentary immunity is , in general terms , independent of the various national parliamentary procedures . &amp; apos ;
That is why , Commissioner , we are asking you to give special consideration to the integrated approach in your future action plans .
Through lack of sufficient reactions on the part of the Russian Government at this stage , we need to bring up this issue at all levels .
Madam President , Commissioner , in September 1997 when I drew up the opinions of the Committee on Agriculture on the Agenda 2000 Communication and on the Structural Fund reform , especially concerning Objective 2 , I highlighted the financial problems of the CAP as well as the dramatic consequences that the initial proposals put forward by the Commission would have on European farmers &amp; apos ; incomes .
Europe will never make progress until the European institutions , ourselves , but also the Commission - and this was debated at length yesterday - provide the necessary elements to facilitate understanding of their work , and this is true for all the information given to the citizens of the Union .
The Union requires a more effective and more integrated supervisory system in order to be better equipped to tackle financial crises .
That means we must set up the necessary monitoring system so that we can apply dissuasive and even penal measures , which could even include economic sanctions .
Even if he is right , our whole plan to fight climate change is a response to the serious economic crisis we are now experiencing .
That , Mr President , is democracy - pure and simple .
Fundamental values , such as equality , solidarity and democracy , are at stake .
The report is also unacceptable with regard to Parliament &amp; apos ; s buildings .
We do not want the better to be the enemy of the good here .
These are the measures that have been envisaged under the Fifth Framework Programme and which are to be implemented .
I would like to say that I am at your disposal morning , noon and night to work hand in hand with the European Parliament , which now has an essential place , not only in our institutions , but also in the hearts of our fellow citizens .
It must be able to deal with the situation in the European Union .
That is the philosophy contained in this report .
After , and only after , this attempt to overhaul the EU , we might have studied the technical consequences of enlargement , on our agricultural and regional policies for example .
It is not that simple , but I will try my hand at it in any case .
Data on investments will be compiled yearly , whilst the total current expenditure will be compiled every three years .
Such a measure would be totally im@@ practicable and counterproductive .
These measures will certainly be part of the discussions at the Fifth Review Conference .
The Commission will see the number of its members reduced and its coordination strengthened .
A counterfe@@ iter runs a huge risk because he is attacking an element of a State &amp; apos ; s sovereignty : its currency .
The Constitution should take account of this democratic deficit if it is to succeed in bringing Europe closer to its citizens .
This is difficult , but I think that it is necessary , because otherwise we can expect a real crisis over the legitimacy of the current European economic and social model .
Pu@@ tting all these things right is one of the main objectives of this agency , in order to safeguard the health and safety of the consumer all the way from the farm to the fork .
Mr Barroso , we will be unable to build an equitable model in the future if we do not have a fiscal policy at European level .
If those people continue to prefer to take to the high seas , I hope they will use a big s@@ ail .
Madam President , let us admit that it looked like we were heading for disaster with 1 2@@ 67 amendments . The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has therefore chosen to table as few amendments as possible .
It is now up to the European Commission to draft final provisions based on the proposals in this report in a coherent manner with the principle of subsidiarity and with one aim : to ensure that the Roma become fully fledged European citizens .
But for that it seems to me we also need the debate at the Feira European Council to give us a political signal .
I am in favour , for example , of introducing product labelling designed to develop eco @-@ consumption consumption .
We therefore do indeed need a development policy .
For its part , the Commission has protected free movement . Re@@ al subsidiarity means ensuring that consumers , with the help of their country , can each protect themselves .
On this subject , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to say that the Commission shall exercise the utmost pragmatism in working in this programming .
Furthermore , another problem is that , often , European scenarios do not correspond to the detailed scenarios drawn up by Member States .
Nevertheless , the Member States must be encouraged to continue along these lines .
Consequently we have abstained from voting .
The European Parliament dreams only of extending its power , and to achieve this dream , it knows that it needs to extend the sphere of Community activity , which is what the Commission s@@ pend@@ s most of its time doing as well .
We strongly request that a solution be sought for the conflict which is raging between all the parties involved in the Ch@@ it@@ tag@@ ong H@@ ill T@@ rac@@ ts and call upon responsible politicians to do everything possible to halt the coloni@@ zation and milit@@ ari@@ zation of this region .
We therefore need to study its economic and legal repercussions in detail .
And here I would like to congratulate Mr Moratinos , our European ambassador , on the quality of his work and his determination .
It is now legitimate to ask that question in the light of the situation in Georgia .
I will not go back over the content , development and scope of the negotiations that have taken place .
In the months ahead , a wide @-@ ranging ranging debate on migration must be launched .
Furthermore , in spite of some reluctance on the part of the rapporteur , I am happy with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development &amp; apos ; s proposals and reaffirm that Community production must benefit from the consequences of the most recent enlargement and a possible increase in the market .
Li@@ fting the blockade of Lebanon is now a matter of urgency , but the main priority is to settle the conflict between Israel and Palestine before it is too late .
You know that I was against quotas as I find it somewhat degrading having to protect women who should be able to progress on the basis of their skills .
I think there is also a need to facilitate access to high quality work experience in Europe and , therefore , to preserve and strengthen the existing programmes aimed at increasing apprenti@@ ces &amp; apos ; mobility .
As the Council President mentioned , following Helsinki , negotiations are now in progress with all the candidate countries .
We must go further and call for the suspension of the agreement if the principles set out are infringed .
Ladies and gentlemen , I invite you to adopt , not a perfect report , but a very honourable report of which we can be proud , and which will be a good working tool .
The latter should be promoted by the EU in its relations with other countries and should involve consistent action between the two dimensions , internal and external .
Then , of course , there are the directives on temporary work and working time .
Mme Laperrouze has listed all the points on which we have made progress .
rapporteur . - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I should like to express particular thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the draftsmen of opinions for their valuable assistance .
We are very much relying on Parliament &amp; apos ; s contribution to this effort in order to strengthen and enhance the solidarity of the people of the European Union and of the other Union players in this area , notably the NGOs .
They must guarantee access to high quality services for all citizens throughout the whole of the territory and at the same price .
The European Commission has also activated the Community Civil Protection Mechanism , which coordin@@ ates offers of assistance from the Member States and currently represents the crux of our crisis response system .
Indeed , we must not forget that maritime safety and legislation are there , first and foremost , to protect the lives of the seafarers on board , whether they are fishermen , traders or employed in another form of transport .
In anticipation of the EU @-@ Japan Japan Summit at the end of the month , Parliament has adopted this resolution stating its views on trade relations between the two partners .
One of the preliminary conclusions is that the efforts and investment made by the Member States in terms of monitoring should be increased in order to reach the levels required by European legislation .
However , we have some concerns about the ulterior motives of the Hoppenstedt report .
Mrs Wallström , the Commission &amp; apos ; s role is not just to make observations , but to present proposals .
Citizens &amp; apos ; initiatives should also encourage wider cross @-@ border border debate , as they will need to be put together by citizens of several different Member States .
It is necessary to go on pointing out that the treaties provide for progressively setting up a common area of freedom , security and justice along with measures aimed at furthering the compatibility of applicable rules in the Member States in the area of conflicts between laws and competence .
It is therefore allowing a right to be denied which is actually being asserted everywhere else .
We are prepared to support the organisation of elections as soon as local conditions allow .
This is true of passenger transport and freight transport .
What is necessary for this overdue democratic control will be a general tran@@ ss@@ ec@@ toral framework directive for the guiding regulating principles of this transition .
Two aspects of this question should make us increase our vigilance .
I do not think that this is really something we should welcome .
This programme is part of the e @-@ Europe Europe initiative , &amp; quot ; an information society for all &amp; quot ; by the European Union ( EU ) , launched by the Commission in December 1999 .
This is another matter altogether .
In my opinion we must therefore encourage synergy and - why not ? - work towards creating a statute for European society which would make it more efficient in terms of international competition .
In fact , just as the national parliamentarian represents both the interests of his constituents at state level and the national interest as a whole , the European parliamentarian represents the interests of his constituents at European level and the general interests of the Union .
That , Commissioner , is why I would like the Commission to take the initiative to go further , to propose that the Member States go further .
Reform is needed for this , and all the institutions must make an effort here : the future Commission , of course , the future Parliament , naturally , and the Council of Ministers , because the Council of Ministers bears a great deal of the responsibility for the problems which have been identified .
P@@ ush hard for this , let us not give in !
Having followed the work carried out in this House on an action plan for biodiversity conservation and on the Convention on Bi@@ ological Diversi@@ ty , I can state that biodiversity obviously remains the poor relation among our environmental policies .
This unanimity shows that this draft budget is balanced and that it allows all EU governments to identify with it .
Thanks to him and to the new majority , I think Europe , the European Union , will be able to make a new start with Macedonia .
Like everyone else here , I feel ag@@ griev@@ ed that many of the amendments we approved were not adopted by the Council .
All that is needed is for us to make an effort , together , to communicate .
This E@@ I@@ G would carry out within a framework of cooperation major industrial projects at EU level and would enable our resources to be po@@ ol@@ ed .
These programmes promoted cross @-@ border border , transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area .
Indeed , for a few years now , we have once again been observing a tendency for regional disparities to increase , particularly in the field we are considering today .
In order to bring those conditions about , it is not enough , moreover , for the community outside Africa to relaunch the debate and wave the threat of sanctions , insisting on more of these and on the need to take a harder line .
It is not a question of knowing whether a dialogue will be held with Hamas , but of knowing how it will be held , and under what conditions .
What will Europe &amp; apos ; s energy policy be ?
The annual policy strategy submitted by the Commission will thus make it possible , this year , for the first time , for Council and Parliament to enter into a real and stable dialogue on the policy priorities and the working programme for next year .
Today , 30 years later , these problems have still not been resolved .
We will ensure , on the basis of the new strategy for implementing the Charter of Fundamental Rights , that the rights guaranteed by the Charter , including the right to bring collective actions , are taken into account .
The situation we are experiencing is catastrophic .
There is certainly a desire to believe that relations between Israelis and Palestinians are becoming war@@ mer .
We will have to come back to it later .
We greatly appreciate his efforts , and we would have preferred the quality of the work done by him and by the rapporteur to receive a much greater response from this House .
We must never take for granted our great European project , but we must fight each day to strengthen it .
But , these specifically are the issues involved in the work which will be carried out within the convention and , on behalf of my Group , I wish to state the importance we shall accord the charter &amp; apos ; s content in terms of such questions .
The Council also stresses that the preparatory bodies are currently looking into introducing a good practice guide , the aim of which is to assist Member States in carrying out these checks .
As I have already said , we will have to do this work together and with Member States , since I talked to you about measures taken to cut red tape with reference to what the Commission is asking Member States .
Speaking now to you , who have worked so hard on this matter , I wish to reiterate one essential point : the democratic legitimacy of the system proposed in the Constitution .
It seems to me that we must consider the Council &amp; apos ; s decision concerning them by asking ourselves three questions .
The proliferation of competencies , the diversification of spheres of intervention and the legislative bu@@ limi@@ a of the Commission and the European Parliament will no doubt do nothing to make this phenomenon any better .
I support the steps proposed by the Commission aimed at helping the countries of the region , which are already on the road to regional integration thanks to CA@@ R@@ I@@ COM , CA@@ RF@@ O@@ RU@@ M and ME@@ UC .
Then one day the idea has taken sufficient hold for the Barcelona Council in March 2002 to call - to general am@@ az@@ ement - for the average retirement age to be increased by five years .
I am firmly convinced and conscious of the fact that market management mechanisms must be able to play a role alongside direct aid , which we must keep , albeit by adapting the criteria for awarding them .
Common market organisations must be established , the right to property must be revised , veterinary and plant health changes must be made and in particular farmers must be eliminated .
We have also voted in favour of all the amendments that aim to foster the wider recognition of qualifications as well as exchanges of information between countries , despite the fact that many of these amendments are somewhat vague .
So this should be reflected in its membership .
The President cut the speaker off
How should this be done ?
There is a certain hypocrisy to that .
Mr President , you are quite right when you say this war is an intellectual challenge . I would add that it is also a physical one .
On the other hand , the Member States must set a number of objectives for themselves to ensure the proper management of water .
Today the European Union is leading the way in the construction of plants for the various types of energy production .
The fragile balance between security and freedom must be maintained .
It is also stipulated in the joint road map that all cooperation processes must be based on the sovereign decisions of States and the text clearly recognises and I think that this is one of the most important points that the European Union and Russia share the same common values .
So , on the one hand we are dealing with tariffs , but on the other hand , because we are dealing with tariffs , we need rules of origin and therefore customs procedures , so customs procedures will continue to exist .
The European Commission has , however , committed itself to ensuring that the proposed reform will not bring into question either the timeliness of the measures or the way in which they operate and will not affect either the sources of financing or the level of Community support .
Our judgment will be based on the facts .
I would like to thank all the people who contributed to this report , which is the result of a real team effort , and I await their comments with interest .
Secondly , the political representation of the countries in the European Union is linked to their relative demographic weight .
There was , however , a perfectly acceptable solution based on consensus , without the need for a vote . If everyone had been in favour , this item could possibly have been included in the agenda .
We have , in fact , included among the five priorities adopted by our board of directors , and here I quote , &amp; quot ; encouraging environmental protection and sustainable development , in particular implementation of the Kyoto Protocol &amp; quot ; .
There remains a need to respect the decisions of the 25 national parliaments which have ratified .
Does the Commission intend to establish the means to protect its economic policy , to counter the disadvantages to which European industry is exposed by the Echelon system ?
The Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament , which is our fundamental document , must be subject to basic laws , in particular the Treaty .
rapporteur . - Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the debate in Parliament this evening on the Seventh Framework Programme and the prospect of its implementation is undoubtedly a moment for us to rejoice .
It consists of organising assistance from the Member States for those of the Member States that have to cope with the sudden arrival of huge numbers of illegal immigrants , who are anxious to cross the Union &amp; apos ; s external borders .
On many occasions , you have rightly emphasised the fact that , in order for this strategy to succeed , broad popular support is required , as is the proper involvement of all the relevant players , including the national parliaments .
Mr President , there is nothing much to add after what Car@@ l Habsburg @-@ Lothringen Lothringen has just said .
In dealing with these matters , our rapporteurs have centred their considerations both on the Protocol amending the Europol Convention and on improving mutual assistance .
This is why we voted against the Jarzembowski report .
I believe that this greater flexibility will be an important element in absor@@ bing the negative effect in employment terms of any asymmetric shocks in the future .
.@@ On the occasion of the adoption of this report , which I supported , I would like to mention the recent developments in the field of bio@@ energy in Belgium .
Much targeted research has a highly prominent commercial aspect , but there are also more basic forms of research which serve general European Union policies and , at times , also have beneficial spin @-@ off@@ s off@@ s for commercial interests .
I have made it to the best of my knowledge and belief , and I repeat before Parliament my personal commitment in the coming months to avoiding a repeat of such tragedies .
Madam President , just now you had to announce some extremely sad news .
For this reason , the Presidency has sought to ensure that third countries are fully involved in the actions taken by the European Union .
I am in no doubt that during this presidency we will all be able to adopt a revised Lisbon strategy , which will have greater force and be able to revive our European social model in a modernised form in order to guarantee the prosperity of our fellow citizens .
The same has happened under other circumstances .
I would , however , also like to thank the other participants who are , of course , the Commission , which had to play the role of intermediary and technical innov@@ ator , and did so extremely rigorously and effectively , the Commissioner and also all the staff of the Commission .
These should consist of a common political statement and a strategic framework setting out the objectives and listing the measures required for achieving them .
I am , of course , thinking of China , India and Brazil , which absolutely must make a commitment in Copenhagen to achieve similar targets to those of the industrialised countries since , strictly speaking , they are nothing like most of the other developing countries .
Let me just run through the facts .
the recommendation by Mr Z@@ as@@ ada , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the draft decision by Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union , meeting within the Council on the conclusion of the Protocol to Am@@ end the Air Transport Agreement between the United States of America , of the one part , and the European Community and its Member States , of the other part ( 1@@ 5@@ 3@@ 81 / 2010 - C7 @-@ 03@@ 85 03@@ 85 / 2010 - 2010 / 0112 ( NLE ) ) ,
We should be able to show to European citizens that Europe is not only run by men .
During these discussions , the EU has always insisted on respect for individual rights and minority rights .
Pro@@ g@@ ressi@@ vity of the system should be prioriti@@ sed in these cases .
Alas , it did not receive a majority of votes .
It is therefore those common values , including respect for sovereign rights , and also respect for human rights and for the principles of the rule of law , that must guide the development of our relations with Russia .
Similarly , the Commission reiterates its support for the territorial integrity of Indonesia and is mindful of respect for human rights in this province , as in all the other provinces of Indonesia .
It depends on two elements .
That is what I wanted to say at the end of a debate that has been very interesting and useful for me and on which I will report to the Member States and their ministers .
But let me be clear .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to have the opportunity to mention during a priority debate these three reports concerning citizens &amp; apos ; everyday lives .
There is a real divide in the Council on this issue for the time being .
Why do we not use our currency to improve our ability to implement the Lisbon strategy ?
This group , which is furthermore one of the initiators of the resolution on which we shall presently vote , unreservedly condemns the very serious acts of intimidation targeting all those who dare to express the least criticism of the regime set up in Kin@@ sh@@ as@@ a .
The Committee on Budgets wished to draw Parliament &amp; apos ; s attention to a number of disturbing signs such as completion delays and commitments outstanding .
On this issue , the common approach of the United States and the European Union , reaffirmed at the meeting of Heads of State or Government with the US President on 22 February in Brussels , are a source of satisfaction .
That is why I shall ask the House to accept the amendments that I have made with the full support of the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
Priority must be given to economic and social issues ; we need to re @-@ establish establish economic prosperity in order to resolve the social question .
As you can see , the aim will therefore not be to discuss every issue , which would not have made a great deal of sense .
We need , therefore , to give more information , focussing on the most important points in our common policy , for the sake of our citizens and for a social Europe .
This , at any rate , is what emerges from the report by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
Cre@@ ating a European statute for arti@@ sts , introducing a reduced VAT rate for cultural goods and improving the distribution of legal digital offers are appropriate and essential measures for ensuring the international cultural influence of the European Union .
The European Union is trying to achieve this through international cooperation , financial and technical assistance programmes and effective arms control .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , may I say first of all that I find the Council &amp; apos ; s absence since yesterday regrettable , since the Council has generally been present in the negotiations on all the issues we have been discussing since yesterday , namely , those concerning civil liberties , justice and home affairs .
Mr President , while I support the report &amp; quot ; s conclusions with regard to the minimum standard VAT rate , it is my duty to share a few problems I have with some of our rapporteur &amp; quot ; s arguments , and I am pleased to have the support of the great majority of my group in this matter .
Parliament will continue to function until the new Parliament is up and running , and so will the Commission .
The first stage would deal with the immediate , urgent situation .
