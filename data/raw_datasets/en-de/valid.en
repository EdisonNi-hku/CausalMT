in writing . - Across Europe governments and public authorities are having to find ways to save money and show restraint .
It may not be enough but it is certainly more than any other group of donors has done so far .
This is quite right , since the TFTP confronts us again with the challenge of reconciling data sharing with data protection and , if we take up this challenge , this helps us to give citizens security , privacy and data protection .
Mr President , I rise on a point of order as the chairman of the committee which is bringing this report to Parliament , and particularly on behalf of the rapporteur .

This makes the catastrophe even bigger than the 2004 Asian tsunami .
It was , in fact , part of our discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council this week as well .
I will keep Parliament informed of developments in all these areas .
My idea - and this will be one of the main themes of our fisheries policy reform - is to continue heeding scientific advice and also try to find a solution in case that advice is not clear enough and we do not have enough data to form a clear opinion .

Second : What sort of message does he think this sends to the citizen of the existing Union and also of the applicant countries ?
EU agricultural export subsidies gravely undermine food security elsewhere , and we have yet to assess the ecological and social impact of our fisheries agreements with developing countries .
As my colleague was talking about a major tragedy in our country as a result of which nine people died , two representatives were laughing provocatively .
Allowing those accused of terrible human rights abuses to remain free makes it impossible for the communities to be properly reconciled .
I can advise some of those that the women MEPs in suits and ties have stood down for the moment , but they will be back in five years &apos; time if the process does not improve .
Rupert Murdoch is not a Head of State but he is an international media mogul with his own very particular agenda .
I would like to find out from the Commission whether , if we really do not want to fall behind the United States , we should finance the digitisation of European works of art and fund Europeana to a greater extent from the new Lisbon Strategy .
This is the line we have defined in the Commission .
The international black market in organs is attracting people in search of a kidney or other organ , and people living in abject poverty or other vulnerable circumstances are being exploited .
President of the Court of Auditors . - Madam President , honourable Members , thank you for all the kind comments that you have addressed to the Court on this occasion , as a tribute also to those who work in our institution each day addressing , with the highest professional standards , and in accordance with international audit standards , the concerns of this institution .
The provision of knowledge to empower and innovate was not catered for at a national level .

It is obvious as well that the text of the chairs is not cast in stone .
I know that a great many of you hope that it will be possible to conclude the Constitutional Treaty before the European Parliament elections , and indeed , privately , that would be my hope and desire too .
Therefore , I agree with my colleagues on the importance of prudence in the question .
These are minor changes .
This is a big opportunity .
Mr President , I wish to acknowledge the Commission decision to provide ECU 650 million compensation package for farmers who have and still do experience serious financial losses resulting from BSE .
Amendment No 6 by the Socialist Group is hopelessly weak , letting governments off the hook .
In whose interest was it to depart in this piece of fast-track track legislation from tried-and and-tested tested procedures and the practice of using objective performance criteria for environmental standards ?
With these two comments , which I am sure will be taken in the spirit in which they are intended , I would just like to say that I wish the rapporteur every success and thank her again for this report .
You said that those comments were not correct .
But the Commission nonetheless believes that it is a balanced compromise .
Even when I disagree with her , I admire her .
We have an opportunity to bring about the completion of the internal market .
We hope that the new parliament and government is as representative and as inclusive as possible .
In my reply to Parliament and in view of the fact that Parliament deserves to have the opinion of the Commission on all the amendments which have been tabled , I see that I have been speaking for 24 minutes .
There are also serious regional interdependencies .
It is like old Cold War warriors coming together again , trying to fight in a more globally warmed arena .

This is not stating anything new , but these are the issues .
I commend this measure to the House .
This is because of the lack of competition in the European Union across borders and within different areas .
It is contrary to human nature , which logically should shine forth in a democracy , however inconvenient .
But we should make it very clear that it is not those who are producing food that are responsible .
It stresses , in this respect , that results of democratic elections must be fully respected by all participants , including the defeated candidates , and underlines that failure to uphold these results would further put at risk both peace and stability in Côte d &apos; Ivoire ;
And finally , the Commission is looking ahead to a migration policy .
For example the construction in progress is wiping out a whole village called Eesti-Aiake Aiake or &quot; Estonian Garden &quot; in English , which was founded 120 years ago by 36 Estonian families , who migrated to the Caucasus region in Imperial Russia and who were granted lands there .
Vice-President President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Madam President , the NATO Summit in Lisbon was a success for NATO and indeed for its Secretary-General General .
Since I became an MEP , it is hard to remember any issue which has provoked such a deluge of letters as the subject of biofuels .
However , I welcome the report &apos; s reconfirmation that the EU has a profound interest in a stable , prosperous and open China , which embraces democratic practices , free market principles , human rights and the rule of law , and that the EU must pursue policies which will help China further its endeavours in this direction .
To that end we have previously had action plans from the Commission on how it can use its instruments to support that process .
The Lisbon Treaty gives the EU almost as much power over such issues as the CAP gives to our agricultural policy , and it would be totally irresponsible to ignore the impact of all the ...
That is a depressing answer , Commissioner , so I hope very much that , in the provision of services directive you are proposing , you will recognise that this is an important issue , and above all that in these situations we are very often discussing a deeply human tragedy .
These reports are available on the Commission &apos; s website .
Considering that money laundering is at the heart of organised crime , especially drug trafficking , which represents such a threat to public health and public security , one cannot but endorse this proposed measure .
An internal coordinated approach has to begin in 1997 .
We want the presence of observers to deter violence and electoral fraud so that the Zimbabwean people can make a genuinely free choice .

President Chirac often tries to portray France as a champion of European integration and blames other countries for any perceived lack of enthusiasm .
We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis .
I think this controversy lays bare , once again , rules on state aid and exactly where EU policy is directed .
However a certain political momentum towards political reconciliation has been created through the Lomé framework agreement that was reached between the government and the opposition in July of this year .
Parallel to the work on the national action plans against poverty and social exclusion , work has been going on to develop a list of common indicators in the field of social inclusion .
This is an implication which also needs to be addressed .
I am looking forward to this debate and to Parliament &apos; s understanding as we try together to create the sort of external service which the European Union deserves .
Indeed , the current crisis highlighted the most painful weaknesses of our increasingly interconnected global economy .
There are many aspects of this report which produced something of a stalemate between many of us , such as the nature of EU legislation .
I think that we should highlight what unites us rather than some specific issues about the way we communicate .
I am sad to say that we understand only too well that the scourge of drug addiction is big business too .
If there is anything to add at the end of the vote , I will bring it to you .
On the other hand , they also feel some kind of injustice because of the differences in payments between the older Member States and the new Member States .
The Danish Breeding Association , in my opinion , should have taken up this issue with the Swedish Association .
It has been a great pleasure to work with him on this matter .
The initial analysis is basically good but the proposals for action are often little more than a description of an issue .
This can only happen after it is ensured through analytical results and investigations that the farms are not contaminated at levels above those provided by the EU law .
in writing . - Mr President , as a former javelin thrower and current President of the Estonian Ski Association , I am sincerely glad that Pál Schmitt has come up with a report on the role of sport in education .
Mr President , I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs van den Burg , for the excellent work she has done in preparing this report on the future of financial regulation in Europe , which is such a complicated and controversial subject .
We must welcome the fact that agreement has been reached to lift some restrictions on food aid destined for those in dire need , but all possible pressure must be maintained to ensure that humanitarian aid gets through everywhere .

If I could just quote two lines here : &apos; Ideally it would be preferable to ensure that measures to address the immediate problems caused by the recession are aligned with long-term term goals &apos; .

I agree that the EU &apos; s civil protection doctrine has to be founded on a &apos; bottom-up up &apos; approach and that primary responsibility for civil protection activity should be with the Member States .
At a time of regional crisis and an international economic downturn , this will not be easy .
A freight train is not .
We in Britain were promised a referendum .
We have achieved several important changes to the draft proposal , which will bring greater protection for human health and the environment , especially in the area where the maximum threshold for the amount of PFOS that can be placed on the market as a substance or preparation has been substantially reduced from the Commission &apos; s original proposal .
We must be aware that , according to the Treaties , civil protection measures fall under the competence of the Member States .
We were therefore faced with the possibility of voting for amendments and voting for reports from our own committee which would have had a very serious economic impact in our own Member State .

I attended the Doha Round of talks in Hong Kong last December and before that those in Cancún , and I informed this Parliament of the false impression that is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to EU markets .
It is my argument - and indeed that was expressed in my report and supported by colleagues - that if the appraisal and development system works properly there are no obstacles to achieving the linear career structure - and that is the whole thrust of what you are trying to do .
This is not a victimless crime .
Anything would be better than what they have been facing in the recent past .
It is a grave state of affairs that for too long cosmetic cowboys have got away with not explaining these simple facts .

I would really claim that we have to have some more knowledge about it .
Here , again , I agree with most of your proposals , and in particular the establishment by local fishermen of coastal management plans , the harmonisation of data on coastal fisheries , the improvement of training for men and women involved in this type of fishing , better coordination of all aspects affecting coastal areas and fishermen , the improvement of vessel safety and of the safety culture for those involved , the need to recognise the role of women and improve their legal work status and , last but not least , the better involvement of coastal fisheries in decision-making making and representatives bodies , such as the RACs .
However , consumers &apos; enthusiasm for green goods has yet to be matched by industry .
Finally , in answer to Mrs Doyle I would say that the problem of minor use for minor species is taken into account in the Animal Health Action Plan through the Technology Platform project , which comes under the Seventh Research Framework Programme .
Indeed those same people who feel no connection with the political movements or the political parties in their own countries are very likely to turn up at demonstrations about anti-globalisation globalisation , about reclaiming the streets or eradication of poverty and so on .

The Commission can also accept Amendment No 5 , because it takes into consideration the evolution of other important legislation in this sector , such as the TSE regulation approved by the European Parliament at the last Parliament part-session session .
It is the American Administration that is the problem .
The list of disappointments and failures during the term of office of this Commission is far too long , as is that of the unaccomplished promises and initiatives .
Yesterday the Commission published a communication on EPAs , which at long last acknowledged the impossibility of completing negotiations by the end of 2007 , as was previously planned and reported in my report .
We would also propose to clarify , through the drafting of guidelines , the application of EU rules in two important areas .
I also note that the people of Wales have been among those to benefit from funding following the terrible floods of 2007 .
The current body on which , if it goes ahead , this will be built - the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia - has not actually shown itself to be that objective or that positive in its work .
This gives Parliament a fully legitimate but unprecedented degree of legislative power over the framework covering external spending .

If people feel threatened by the process , it simply will not work : we need to involve everybody in a partnership .

On family unification , I would say to Mr Gollnisch that I can well understand , if there were members of his family who were separated from him by thousands of kilometres , that they would not want family reunification - they would be grateful to be parted from him .
Governments need to do what is necessary to address this .
Would he agree with me that the situation as regards beef has now tended , in the public eye , to throw into chaos the question of the acceptability of judgments delivered at the European level on food safety and that this bodes rather ill for Mr Prodi &apos; s plan for a European food safety agency ?
The key question these days is not so much one of technology itself but how technology is used in a way which contributes to growth through improved productivity .

Today is quite depressing . What we have in this Parliament , which ought to be taking seriously its responsibilities for discharge , is in effect a meeting of the Budget Control Committee with a few other Members .
However , let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues : the death penalty , Cuba and China .
An effective stock recovery programme is essential for the future of cod fisheries in Scotland and the UK .
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this , but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail .
Our position remains simple and clear .
Lastly , on the issue of plant-based based infection , maybe that has something to do with the increase in organic food consumption where I understand you are 30 times more likely to get e-coli coli infection .

We need net neutrality and we need a policy that says &apos; yes &apos; to the fantastic possibilities that the internet and the new information technology give us all .
However , racism and xenophobic attacks and discriminations occur in the social and economic spheres and must be countered by measures to abolish such discriminations , which exist also in institutionalised forms .
Mr President , on a point of order , if that is how the Rules are , then they are stupid and should be changed .
I support this legislation because it will create a fairer system for legitimate European workers .
We believe that the European Parliament , the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should play a more active role in helping to implement and monitor the strategy .

We are told that the United States is opposed .
There is no problem about an exit strategy .
In answer to Mr Belder , who may have already disappeared , the Commission &apos; s proposal on how to cooperate between the institutions was in direct implementation of Articles 312 , 324 and , specifically , Article 311 of the Lisbon Treaty , for the specific procedure on the own resources decision in full respect of the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States .

We talk a great deal about violence against the people , we talk a lot about democracy .
I sincerely hope that this week Parliament will send a strong message of support for this objective .
I must say the biggest problem is that all the competence in customs and value added tax is in the hands of the Member States .
Article 301 of the Penal Code on insulting Turkishness has resulted in many convictions and , in March - rather bizarrely in my view - a court in Istanbul issued an order denying access to the video-sharing sharing website YouTube when allegations were made on the sexuality of the founding father of modern Turkey , Kemal Atatürk .
Police are dismayed that the chances of a successful prosecution of traffickers are being undermined by a policy of deporting victims as illegal immigrants or making assistance conditional .

This is not really an issue of dealing with monopolies , because we support the Commission on this prime objective .
Can I assume from your answer that the Commission still believes that constructive engagement has any value ?

It is in the e-Commerce Commerce Directive and we are simply referring to that .
One of the great difficulties in establishing a network of mutual recognition is the complexity of the procedures required to put it into place and to ensure the ongoing compatibility and appropriateness of the mutual recognition network .

And it does not have to be centralised ; it can be done in a decentralised or bilateral manner .

This report is not about India and it is not about Pakistan .
The Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy would like Member States to look at what policy instruments could be used to promote cultural industries .
In this regard the main concern within the EU is the apparent lack of a level playing field .
Regarding Amendment No 25 , we hope that the Commissioner will take on board this amendment because it contains ideas for drawing up environment plans for the applicant countries .
We have used this proposal to update and complete existing instruments on the basis of scientific developments , including , for the first time , several important harmonisation measures .
I forgot to mention the article on the agora , which Mr Botopoulos and Mr Onesta can claim the paternity for .
I feel that , in the long run , this will be well worth it .
We have a permanent representative who is very actively engaged in discussions at the IMF .
I understand that recent talks in London were inconclusive , but I note that they will resume next week .
I am therefore pleased to see that the rapporteur agrees with the main elements of the reform which I have set out in the proposal for an eighth directive on statutory audit .

The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone .
However , as we all know , everyone wants someone else to do it .
Firstly , the TEP is going to give us a possibility of finding a framework to discuss multilateral issues with the United States .
That is the thrust of our approach to this budget .
It really takes your breath away that there are plenty of other airlines who would be filling to fill the slots but are unable to because Air India is holding onto them .
In total , over 56 000 people safely made it home .
I do not want to take too much time on TACs and quotas but I should like to thank the Commission for making available to us the details after the meeting on 19 and 20 December .

However , the funding from the EU Solidarity Fund will make a real difference to the region and its long-term term recovery , and the existence and effective operation of this fund demonstrates the solidarity between the Member States of the European Union .
This is primarily an issue of subsidiarity and should not even be considered at a European level , quite apart from whether such charging is right in principle , given the vast amounts which the motorist already pays in taxation .
The first of January this year was a truly historic moment for all of us , not only for you , the 53 new Members of the European Parliament , who finally saw your countries join the European family , but also for all of us , because the accession of Bulgaria and Romania completed the fifth enlargement of the European Union , which has contributed to peace , prosperity , stability and democracy throughout Europe .
As such , this report outlines many of the measures necessary to prevent such an outbreak occurring on the same scale in the future .
There was no conceivable argument against use or about the possible dangers that might occur that she did not invoke .
As for the very strange remarks by Mr Batten from UKIP and his reference to the next European elections , we shall see .
Mr President , like previous speakers , I , too , had an objection to the inclusion of paragraph 7 . We were given a free vote by our group , but our delegation decided to vote against because - as speakers have said - talking about reproductive health rights is another way of saying abortion .
Beside the disastrous social and economic consequences of this deterioration , environmental aspects should also be addressed .
Mr President , at last year &apos; s Spring Council , EU leaders signed up to a &apos; 20 % by 2020 &apos; target for energy efficiency , but delivery of this target remains sluggish .
Guinean citizens had gathered in a stadium in the capital to demonstrate against the presumed intention of the Guinean military interim leader , Captain Moussa Dadis Camara , to run for President .

Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 will now be updated to &apos; version two &apos; , one might say .
Mr President , it is very important to stick to the view that volume matters when we talk about these problems .
The direct humanitarian impact of the war has fortunately been smaller than was expected by most humanitarian agencies .
It is a question of who represents the law : the drug barons and the murder squads or the police and the justice department or the politicians .
I welcome the fact that the newly established European Food Safety Authority will play a key role in assessing applications for authorisation .
In line with discard policy , the Commission is proposing new rules about real-time time closures and moving-on on provisions for specific fisheries in order to reduce discarding practices .
If the EU will not address this crucial issue in a principled manner , hardly any progress can be expected .
Member of the Commission . - We believe that the disease will spread throughout the whole of Europe in 2008 .
For the United States there are real issues about particular sectors .
So I would like to emphasise again that this is a first step in addressing just one of the areas of concern .
So Salford is sponsored by both a private sector operator and an operator with a state monopoly .
People around the world are craving peace and a renewed sense of security .
Following a special report , the European Parliament last year adopted a revised version of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour .
The EU &apos; s commitment to diversification of source and supply under a common external energy security policy must surely strengthen our hand at the negotiating table with Russia .

In the face of genuine asylum-seeking seeking , this is not good enough .
It is true that IDABC has been a driver of modernisation of public services and a contributor , as it will continue to be , to eGovernment in the candidate countries .
That is indeed very disquieting .
For example , Amendment 1 concentrates on research and development .
The Commission is aware of the concerns expressed by NGOs and UNHCR on Libya &quot; s respect of human rights , in particular as regards refugees &quot; protection .
They expressed a fear , which I certainly shared at the beginning of the discussions , that the instrument being proposed and discussed here could , if mishandled , be a pretext for protectionist behaviour rather than , as is intended , a targeted instrument to deter unfair pricing and excessive use of subsidies elsewhere .
We cannot accept that .
We have to avoid raising too many expectations and overloading the Commission with tasks .
It must now sit down with the Commission and examine the eradication programme and adopt a set of measures to eradicate BSE and restore consumer confidence .
When the euro is launched it will be necessary to exchange money held in present currencies for the new currency .
We must also maintain unrelenting concentration on Afghanistan , on which we had a donors &apos; meeting here in Brussels at the beginning of the week : a recognition of how prominent a part we are playing under UN auspices in the reconstruction in that country , which still faces appalling problems .
Finally , let me reassure my Spanish colleagues that the people of Almadén will have my full support for their just demands , which , in my view , can be achieved fully through the compromise package and not in opposition to it .
After the agreement reached in the Preparatory Committee on the final document for the Conference , we should focus our attention on positive initiatives that the EU could make in key areas and on the input we can make in the political declaration in Monterrey .
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50 .
Stranger still , though , is the complete absence from that campaign of the British Tory Party , who were skulking behind the petticoats of Declan Ganley and President Klaus .
However , we would also have to bear in mind that target values would not be attained where it is not efficient from an economic viewpoint .
I make the decision on the basis of that .
Mr President , at first sight this report may seem like a technical one , simply summarising the science as we know it .
As usual it is , and always will be , giving too little too late .
We have asked for more information .
After suffering as we have , in our country , we are alarmed to see the disease still rampant in some other European countries .
The Council and the Commission are , I am afraid , confused .
Before I make some pertinent comments on the report , I want to pay tribute to my colleague , Mrs Maij-Weggen Weggen , who leaves this House this month .
As much as I would like to talk about happiness in life I did not mention that in my reply .
After all , every other state has a national assembly elected by a uniform method .
Support for improved cooperation in the consular field is not always matched by adequate budgets at the national level .
This to my mind cannot continue and I hope the Commission , in cooperation with Lomé countries , is seriously looking at a feasible structure that is historically , socially and institutionally a grouping that gives a sound basis to work from .
We need to be able to sort out this problem and look at it very practically .
The challenge of reducing poverty is one in which the whole international community is involved and we share with others the framework for providing aid and for assessing the results .
I want to make that absolutely clear .
Following that , by September , the Commission will prioritise and organise ideas in order to prepare the draft communication on the strategy and the accompanying action plan .
I think Parliament itself should do more to ensure that the nice , correct analysis presented by all parties here is representative of the whole House .
Indeed , if you look at the Treaties that give the legal basis and authority to the Member States and to the different institutions to take action , the Council can in fact take action under the Euratom Treaty .
We would not want to be treated by a drunken doctor and I do not believe that we should be treated by an over-tired tired doctor .
We cannot legislate in the abstract !
Mr President , I wish to begin by saying how much I welcome this constructive and lively debate and how pleased I am at the extent to which the views of the Commission have been supported consistently across the House .
So I will remind Parliament and the Commissioners , as culture spokesmen do every year , that perhaps we have not got our priorities quite right .
Yet it was clear that they had to be addressed .
The same goes for privacy of individuals , protection of proceedings and business secrecy .
They are not protecting human health , nor are they protecting the vulnerable .
Thirdly , we have a mechanism - the Quartet - and sometimes we do not realise how much effort goes into that .
It might even be in our own interest , rejuvenating an ageing population and enriching our own culture .
This work is being led by the Commissioner in charge of energy , Mr Piebalgs , and the Commission will report to Parliament and to the Council at the turn of the year .
That , in my judgement , is the challenge for the next few weeks .
I voted for this resolution because I am in favour of the EU support for Tunisia &apos; s economy in the form of loans and subsidies that would offer Tunisians the prospect of skilled jobs , as part of a genuine development contract to foster local and foreign productive investment .
This report also lays down important markers underlining the importance of the principle of decentralisation ( the &apos; bottom-up up &apos; approach ) with a view to improving the &apos; partnership principle &apos; with local authorities who are often best placed to recognise the needs of citizens across the EU , and especially in Wales .
Why did the Commission come up with these even stricter and substantially more expensive ceilings only one month later ?
We will gather enough scientific evidence to be able to convince even those who are reluctant at this stage .
I think , Mrs Kaufmann , that you can be proud of helping to establish what I call establishing and charging the power lines between citizens and the European institutions - new power lines , drawing them up and charging them .
You said you would accept supplementaries from questioners who are present .
Women should not be disadvantaged for reasons beyond their power : the pay gap , as my colleague mentioned , taking care of relatives and non-decent decent work .
We also need to be wary of creating a feeling amongst people that everyone is a potential terrorist or criminal .
Such an obligation would divert the inspection vessel from the performance of its existing tasks , which is certainly not acceptable .
I have read Mr Donnelly &apos; s splendid report and commend him for it .
Today , again , we must insist on compulsory rights for Europe &apos; s blind and partially-sighted sighted people .
He did express his condolences on behalf of the Commission .
The Commission is presently reviewing its policy on retail cross-border border payments in order to deal , amongst others , with the issue of what are still significantly higher prices .
If Europe is to play a leading part in a very competitive , a fiercely competitive , global world , we need all the resources available at the highest possible level .
I recall that , at the time of President Clinton &apos; s second inaugural address , he was able to boast that there are today more people living under democracies than under tyrannies ; we ended the last century with a world which produced as much in two or three years as we had produced in the whole of the 19th century , with incalculable consequences for the living standards of most people .
The role he has played has been greatly appreciated by everybody , by President Saakashvili , by the Minister for Foreign Affairs , by the government as a whole , and by the countries of the region .
So death and destruction can come by simple or complex means .
As such , the Commission will undertake measures to support European Social Fund managing authorities and intermediate bodies to step up the promotion of self-employment employment and micro-enterprises enterprises .
This is a public health goal that underpins our vision for the pharmaceuticals sector .
Nevertheless , the final Morgan report does contain much to commend it , and I welcome the addition of references to the proposed charter on energy consumers &apos; rights .
We are in favour of voluntary action but if it is true that the airlines have known for 30 years about the risks of DVT then maybe we need legislation .

To conclude , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Maria Matias , and thank her and my fellow shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report .
All these consequences were entirely inconsistent with the mainstream world economy .
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them .
I wonder whether this House could contemplate the disappearance off the map of these little countries like Kiribati and Tuvalu and the widespread devastation of Bangladesh , one of the world &apos; s most populous areas .
I think we have to say that such a long lead time makes it unlikely that this can have had an impact on the price level that we see today .
A last general word before concluding : the official launch of this new agreement is , as I think everybody here would agree , a very important occasion and it is an opportunity .
On the one hand all of us here in this Chamber want to see the existence of the fishing industry , not least because we enjoy eating the product ; but on the other hand we are faced with grave scientific evidence of depleting fish stocks , so much so that certain species may no longer exist in the future .
We welcome the focus on African issues , on the holocaust of AIDS and poverty and hunger .
Hence , there is a strong probability of an escalation into a serious military conflict in northern Iraq .
I should like to confirm that this report is available .
On mackerel , the unilateral increase of quotas without discussion and the consequences for neighbouring fleets was short-sighted sighted .

Over the years the EU has been very good at creating free markets for goods and capital .
Commissioner , we welcome the efforts you have made and the backing you have had to get this implemented .

The Commission and the World Bank are ready to organise a donor meeting on 15 October , provided that the Macedonian Parliament adopts the necessary constitutional changes set out in the Framework Agreement .
I know what we voted , but I also know what has been said .
But many of the people protesting throughout the European Union and throughout the world , and making their voice heard , consider that George W. Bush is a threat not to his own people but rather to the world at large .
I would like to say a few words on better regulation , which , as you know , informs all the Commission &apos; s work .
It is within the context of reforming the single market that we have the real opportunity to transform Europe into a more social and sustainable Union , so the question is : does this communication manage to point towards a more green and socially just internal market ?
Citizens of the European Union should receive a positive impression when encountering the Community institutions .
The EU and the US must also work together in a more comprehensive way to tackle new threats to the global networks , such as cyber effects and cyber crime .

Sanctions against the Mugabe regime should continue without interruption and without exemption .
As the original rapporteur , I was compelled to remove my name from the report when the Committee on Fisheries rejected my key amendments .
It is important that we support the work of the Ombudsman , as well as the work of the Committee on Petitions , as it is through handling complaints and petitions on EU matters from citizens that we can find out what is not working well at European level and take corrective measures .
Most stakeholders consulted and submitting their views share the Commission &apos; s opinion that TDIs remain essential in a globalising world economy where multilaterally-agreed agreed competition rules are lacking .
Secondly , targets for SMEs may be perceived as compromising the objective of supporting only research of the highest quality and would go against the principles of equal access and excellence that are fundamental to the Framework Programme .
If - and I say if - we have a new fisheries Commissioner by the end of this week , I call upon him fully to involve the new North Sea Regional Advisory Council in the setting of quotas in advance of this December &apos; s Council , so that a sensible and workable plan on quota setting procedure can take place .
Finally , in the present programming period , under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance , Member States can co-finance finance studies and innovative projects covering the specific situation of women shellfish gatherers .
What we also urgently need is to work out a reliable European cyber defence security strategy .
The zoonoses regulations to which Mrs Paulsen has devoted so much time are in a way the building blocks of the provision of an effective and precautionary food law for the future .
As for the last question , the financial rules do not allow the Commission to transfer possible savings from the market organisation budget to specific national programmes to support Greek farmers .
We must fasten rules around ourselves .
Madam President , following on from what Mr Bourlanges said , with the last amendment we voted we have now actually gone past the margin for Category 3 which means that any amendments which are not in line with the Committee on Budgets &apos; recommendations are going to give us serious problems .
That is what some three-quarters quarters - 74 % - of our fellow Europeans believe , according to the Eurobarometer surveys .
in writing . - I am delighted that the Council has agreed that 12 Member States will use the enhanced cooperation mechanism to push ahead the creation of a unitary EU patent .

We accept this for the individual hunter consuming or passing on the game he has shot or caught .

Member of the Commission . - The Commission is putting the finishing touches on the new EU Biodiversity Strategy , which will provide a framework for action to tackle biodiversity loss over the next decade .
I had the opportunity to have a constructive discussion on a number of the concerns raised by Parliament in the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , together with the Greek Minister of Justice .
Nevertheless , we urge the French Presidency , which has shown such a determined commitment to fight against money laundering , to take account of our demands .
I have taken very good note of what has been said by Parliament , namely , that any future instrument , whatever it looks like , should give consumers a high level of protection in order not to deprive them of the protection they would otherwise enjoy under national law .
Of course , information on origin does not cover everything the consumer may want to know about a specific product , but has the benefit of being useful and clear .
Developments in the southern Mediterranean , in particular in relation to the Tunisian migrants arriving in Lampedusa , have also raised questions about controls at internal borders .
Firstly , there is the proposal that fishing effort should be reduced by up to 40 to 50 % .

The presidency will present its programme on the trade area to the Committee on International Trade on 20 January 2009 .
I hope the human rights dialogue can take place in public .
However , not all WTO members are in the same position and I certainly do not exclude the big agricultural exporters - for example Brazil and Argentina - trying the judicial road if they see that the political and negotiating one is blocked .
We need to bear in mind that the abolition of tariffs could well cause a loss of public resources and , therefore , create budgetary problems .
I am in favour of the Turkish Republic joining the European Union , but this kind of activity will undermine its efforts to do so .
The rapporteur &apos; s report calls for a &apos; budget for results &apos; , and I fully share this opinion and approach of Mr Virrankoski .
I do not believe that quotas will improve matters , but I think we need quotas to keep our broadcasters under control so that they do recognize our desire for our programmes made in our own languages and in our own way .
The Commission will certainly focus on that .
The letter from the Presidents and Prime Ministers of the five solid and solvent countries should not be forgotten and pushed aside .
That means that Mexico will not be able to ensure that trade and foreign investment support its own emerging markets and its own development objectives .
And yes , I am worried about the spill-over over of these Hungarian patterns .
The European messages of condolence therefore particularly emphasise the need to preserve democracy - a democracy that has been a remarkable achievement of the Kingdom of Nepal and of the late King Birendra .

We have not drawn any conclusions at this stage but we want six more months to investigate this case thoroughly .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I wish to thank this House for putting the issue of European agencies on the agenda .
On the institutional question , I am bound to say that when I received the statement from the Commission yesterday evening at about 6 or 7 p.m. , I felt it was tantamount to an interference with parliamentary procedure and sovereignty .
The objective also applies to people with mobility handicaps .
We should strive for the best possible Utopian ideal and work towards that .
In order to guide Mediterranean fisheries towards sustainable exploitation of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem , the European Union , which is the biggest fishing power in the region , needs to set a good and credible example .
I do not recommend going any further than that .

I sincerely hope , though , that this particular piece of legislation may be stopped .
I would like to make some observations about the report .
In addition , as Mr Hughes pointed out , the other parts of the entitlements come into force immediately .
The Council and the Commission have been invited to jointly prepare a concise synthesis report , drawing on the joint employment report , specifically for that discussion .

Imagine if each of our national governments had to go through a procedure whereby they had to fill in fifty pages of answers to a questionnaire and were subject to three hours of grilling and questioning in public before the national parliaments took a vote of confidence allowing them to take office .
The successful mobilisation of citizens can be seen in the example of Oscar Morales , who set up a Facebook group called &apos; A million voices against the FARC &apos; with the hope of collecting one million people online .
Madam President , I too had not intended to take the floor , but this issue has now occupied our attention for three-quarters quarters of an hour .
We are investing in people in primary education in a large number of countries .
If that opposition is maintained , can the Council suggest any alternatives that have been put forward to maintain the momentum of the European economic recovery plan ?
It is not a meaningless package as the Greens are trying to make out ; it is a package with teeth .
When you shop , things do not always go well .
This is causing huge hardship to great sectors of the population and the lack of purchasing power therefore has a consequence on the food supply .
Lastly , we cannot ignore the impact on the developing world of insecurity , particularly with the grain market , where countries that cannot afford to pay more for food are seeing a massive increase in their food bill .
Mr President , I would also like to thank the rapporteur and Mrs Attwooll for providing the opinion for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee .
The key question is whether there is the political will to drive that change .
This is an industry which is important to Scotland , employing some 5 000 people nationwide .
The PSE voting list tomorrow will reflect our desire not only to see the opening-up up of a consumer credit market in this area but also to achieve the highest possible level of consumer protection for consumers right across Europe .
Our debate on future financing must also consider how we can enhance the priority which we attach to promoting the principle of sustainability in respect of future growth and development .
Turning now to the 31 amendments on LIFE + , I will divide them into four distinct blocks .
Poverty is still with us and the traditional social security systems are threatened .
Members of this Parliament will be aware of the very high degree of public interest in this issue and of the lobbying to which we have all been subjected .
I refuse to be treated in the same way as people who do not come here Mondays and Fridays .
The Commission also retained EUR 9 million out of a total of EUR 18 million - half of the total - until a higher absorption was reached .
But today I will refer to the ethics of this House .
It has been a great privilege to be part of that .
Nevertheless , they are still alive , and I think solidarity is the key .
For example , the Highlands and Islands include some of the most isolated islands in Europe with extreme problems of transport because of weather and tidal conditions and the costs involved .
I know the Commission knows how concerned they are about this issue and I hope that this debate is heard and read elsewhere .
So the Sovietisation of the EU continues .
But let us look at some of the things that we propose .
Let me start by pointing out that the ultimate responsibility in decision-making making to facilitate the political process to determine Kosovo &quot; s future status is in the hands of the United Nations Secretary-General General , in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 .
I urge the Commissioner to take quick decisions on the issue .
Finally , we are aware that mediation activities have been ongoing , aimed at the release of Gilad Shalit .

There is no such reference in the current Treaties , although they were drafted by Saint Schuman .
This provides an excellent opportunity to discuss topics of key importance for energy policy just before the new year , topics that brought a great deal of inquietude last year .
This means that a common approach and , at the very least , good cooperation , are necessary at international level .
Denmark is at 1.0 % ; Norway , not a Member , but still the closest competitor to Denmark . Norway is around 0.9 % .
Now you want to compound that by approving Christine Lagarde - another member of the European political elite , another euro fanatic , somebody else who believes in propping up this euro project - and I would have thought that , as she has got a vested interest , she is , in fact , a highly unsuitable candidate .
I shall refer now to collective redress .
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed .
I am also particularly delighted that the European Council backed another important long-term term measure , in the shape of an agreement to locate the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in Budapest .
I am proud to say that more than a hundred member states are involved in the same type of competition policy as the one we favour , so it is not only us .
It is my conviction that such an evaluation might represent a useful contribution for the participation of the Union in the special session of the United Nations general assembly in September 2001 .
Mr President , I have a rather mundane point as well .
( Abbreviated pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
In this the European Year of Volunteering 2011 , can the Commission update Parliament as to where we currently stand in the legislative process establishing the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps ( EVHAC ) ?

It lays down the basis on which the precautionary principle will be applied .
New Tibetan arrivals apprehended by the Nepalese authorities en route to Kathmandu should be transferred to the UNHCR &apos; s care promptly and without hindrance .
In addition , some parts of the text are potentially ambiguous with areas of legal confusion e.g. paragraph nine on indirect sanctions to be applied to Member States ( paragraph nine ) and the call to extend the powers of the European Court of Justice in its rulings over instruments decided outside the sphere of the EU .
As a Green , my preferred route is always non-violence violence and I believe there is absolutely no justification for violence as a means to change in a democratic state .
First of all , if we are in a knowledge-based based society , we need growth in knowledge-based based and creative skills .
Constitutions are there to ensure that those who simply happen to be elected right now cannot make whatever decisions they want to .
We put in the oral question and we have also drafted a joint resolution about the Lithuanian law , which is allegedly about the protection of minors .
Indeed , even within certain regions of existing Member States there are long-standing standing differences in the way that the law is administered and operated .
It is unethical to use environmental concerns in order to achieve political objectives and , for that reason , I will vote against it .

We should support this report , but this is only just the beginning of the process of working together with all the institutions to deliver what our citizens want , which is effective and efficient regulation or alternatives to regulation .

Finally , let us put more effort into ensuring that there is no difference in approach between the Europeans and the United States .
I hope now that all Members and all members of staff observe the no-smoking smoking areas across the whole of the European Parliament building .
However , we must not forget the need to ensure that domestic jobs - not all of which should be regarded as precarious and undervalued or underpaid - are indeed decent jobs .
The CEO of the second largest aerospace and defence company in the world EADS has actually bemoaned the fact that the US already invests six times more than Europe in armaments research and that while the research budgets in the US continue to rise , those in Europe stagnate .
The first element I would like to highlight is that a set of new targets has been agreed as part of the Implementation Plan .

We are dealing with lives here and human lives must always be protected .
I saw where they had been killed by just one ground-to to-ground ground missile .
Justified differences will remain , and ACTA Parties will not have to adopt the EU system of protecting GIs through sui generis systems .
The President informed me that he had not talked to him but that I was free to do so myself if I wished .
We therefore very strongly welcome the initiative of the parliamentary delegation which visited the region and their subsequent report and draft resolution , which we also support in principle .
However , I agree that we have to have a procedure in place that will nevertheless allow an issue to be raised at Council level should any matter appear to be of a significant or political nature .
Following enlargement of the European Union , the Community is studying the situation concerning red fruits .
in writing . - Madam President , The Gulf of Mexico oil disaster serves as a reminder of the inherent risks involved in maritime oil exploration .
When problems occur , and they always will , it should not be the job of the ECB to paper over the cracks and pull down the shutters .
I agree with you that this is important in stepping up our political dialogue .
We stand by that and I ask them : please do not abuse the freedoms we hold dear .

I should like to thank Members for this interesting debate .
Although I support the worthy objectives of this report , for all of us want to reduce the shocking loss of life and injuries sustained on our roads , I believe the report requires a very quick timetable for implementation and I do not consider that this can be achieved .
As regards my comments on the dominance of the Li Ka-shing shing family - which was the subject of much media interest in Hong Kong today - in some sectors of Hong Kong &apos; s economy , I should like to point out that the reason I have raised this matter is that it has been raised with me by leading figures in Hong Kong and indeed was the subject of major media debate during a recent visit there by myself .
There have been good aspects and defects and the good aspects have been many - the customs 2000 , administration , convention bankruptcy , harmonization of products .
A more stable neighbourhood and a more stable world guarantee a more stable European Union .
The year 2005 was a bad one for the peace process .
The sharing of data has been widened to include agencies which have not all been specified .
In response to the letter sent by the chair of the Committee on Development , Mrs Morgantini , I am pleased to confirm that this review date will also apply to the development cooperation instrument .
It is a scandal that they will have waited 20 years in total for rules that will continue to allow hazardous chemicals to be used in everyday products , even when substitutes are readily available .
That I think is the appropriate way of dealing with this .
Commissioner , thank you for restating your commitment to the principle of the free movement of workers .
The Commission is still too willing to make the unthinking assumption that trade liberalisation is an aim in itself , rather than a tool to serve the greater purpose of sustainable development .
It is only because Parliament stood together as one , despite attempts by certain people to divide Members and to have us at each other &apos; s throats , that we succeeded in producing this .
In light of that undeniable fact , would it not be madness to continue to pursue expansion to include even poorer , and undeniably burdensome , countries like Turkey which are not , by any stretch of the imagination , even European ?
I drew the House &apos; s attention to this man at the last part-session session as the man who wanted to haul down the European flag in Scotland instead of flying the Scottish flag in Europe by saying let us have a special deal for Scotland , let us get things moving .
Let me just ask a question and leave it as a question on this . The question is whether the strengthening of the economic leg of governance can succeed without a collective effort on wages , on coordinating wage developments in the European Union .
The following year this was down to 4.1 years and , at the end of 2001 , the figure was 3.6 years .

In the event of a postponement , the financial impact of circa 24 million should be deducted from the 2007 budget .
However , my question is slightly more fundamental than Mr Kerr &apos; s .
There is far too great a tendency to blame septic tanks for the threat of pollution to Irish drinking water .
Whatever emerges , there is a duty on the EU to continue to press for reform in Romania &quot; s state residential institutions .
At a time when the generosity of people across Europe and the world towards the victims of the tsunami disaster is evident to all , it is inexplicable why this Parliament is committing a considerable sum of money to a programme of events and receptions in support of the European Constitution .
Their plea for short-term term aid has fallen on deaf ears , even though it lies within the power of the local minister to pay de minimis aid under state rules .
Today I acknowledge that , on the question of the Tsunami , there remains a EUR 13 million gap but , in the spirit of the cooperation and progress we were able to make back in July , I am still optimistic that we should be able to close that gap in a relatively short period of time .
I hope that support from Parliament on this will muster enthusiasm among Member States .
I still think there is a problem in the last sentence , but I am sure the services can also rectify that .

We expect this to be before its presentation in February . We note the commitment to consult us on the reform of the Staff Regulations which addresses some of Mr Elles &apos; concerns , the new commitments given to whistleblowers and the need to develop new disciplinary procedures .
I wish to remind colleagues that any common position on foreign policy would be determined by the Member States represented in the Council , not by the Commission , and certainly not by this Parliament .
We wanted to split the text so as to delete the word &apos; biotechnology &quot; .
Mr President , the escalation of tension in the Palestinian territory was provoked by the Hamas-led led kidnapping of Corporal Shalit with unrealistic demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners .
The second remark I would like to make is about an amendment introduced by Mrs Muscardini , which , in fact , proposes that this &apos; made in &apos; regulation would be a kind of pilot project that would be evaluated after a four-year year period and perhaps changed .
It says quite clearly : &apos; Takes the view that cross-border border transport , etc . &apos;
So , in welcoming this , I ask the Commission to think about the next step forward , to encourage new technologies and encourage consumers and businesses to use them .

Amendment No 26 has to be rejected .
So where Europe can act together on this , it should be encouraged .
As Mr Diamandouros has already said , in 2009 , the Ombudsman recorded a total of 3 098 complaints , as against 3 406 in 2008 .
For these reasons , as the report currently stands - I stress as it currently stands - I regret I will not be able to support it .
Mr President , on Côte d &apos; Ivoire , we tabled an amendment today .
President Yanukovych &apos; s government has undertaken a number of important economic reforms in recent months , which should be commended .
Despite the early optimism felt after Israel &quot; s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza , the picture today is much bleaker than had been hoped for .
We must ask how we are going to deliver the skills we actually need in order to make our climate change targets practicable .
To avoid the regular infringements by Member States facing difficulties in balancing their public finances , the SGP should remain an incentive to induce fiscal adjustment in EU members and thus the revision should avoid the emergence of an increased arbitrariness in the implementation of the SGP .
The Commission hopes that we will find a solution for these important financing instruments .
Further , many constituents stressed that a swift endorsement of IFRS 8 would remove uncertainty about the treatment of financial statements for the period ending in December 2007 .
And most importantly , to ensure that farmers receive a fair and adequate price for their production .
in writing . - The EU needs to take a greater interest in the increasing violence in Mexico created by drug wars .
By supporting the translation of works of literature and other books into a wide range of languages we can do this , we can overcome some of these fears .
This will diminish the level of errors .
I can already say that the Chilean Government seems in full agreement with this approach to our negotiations .
No , we do not .
They did not use the internet enough .
What I am asking is : have any Members indicated to your Secretariat and thereby to you , in writing , that they will be present but not participating in any of the roll-call call votes ?
The core of the EU is the Single Market and there can be no weakening of it .
We cannot go on like this , and I look forward to a new start where we base decisions , especially about data storage and transfer , on our basic bedrock principles of proportionality , necessity and legal processing .
I hope the heads of government will not be too distracted by the situation in Egypt .
We cannot afford to close our eyes to the reality .
Mr President , congratulations to Mr Busquin and Mr Gérard Caudron .
One thing is clear , however . The monitoring of compliance with EU laws and respect for the Union &apos; s values is not a process which should end upon accession .
Debates about national tastes and products give us too far wide a sphere for ridiculous discussions .

Although we wholeheartedly support the Ecofin proposals , the road map and everything that has been produced , we have doubts that they will solve the problems we have in Europe .
Once again , I refer you to the first strand of the public health programme that will be in operation from 1 January 2003 .
Madam President , I am very happy to speak on this motion because I actually voted in favour of it , like many colleagues in this House .
We feel confident that the stocktaking process on the raising the game exercise , together with the survey &quot; s conclusions , should go a long way towards improving this important aspect .

Member of the Commission . - The Commission has closely followed the activity of the credit rating agencies ( CRAs ) over the past few years .
The other thing is that the Commission does not want to fund the transfer of vessels to flags of convenience which flout international management regulations .
Progress will certainly not be achieved if others emulate the tactics used by Mr Berlusconi in his shameful attempt to defend illegal milk subsidies at the expense of a deal on the taxation of savings .
And for Europe and the world , is not the key issue to develop a sustainable land use policy which will give us food , feed , energy and environmental goods ?
The same applies to trains or trucks .
This will be an important step in helping to build a bridge between economic operators and public authorities on the one hand , and citizens on the other .
It did not just occur when he became directly involved through the presidency .
We will , however , have to look carefully at the exact wording .
All in all , although it has been long , it has been well worthwhile .
We should also have a bit of leeway within Parliament : for opening remarks in a Member &apos; s maiden speech or for other important occasions during the Presidency , people should be allowed to use their own language , even though it may not be an official working language , on condition that they give a translation to the services before they make their speech .
Instead let us thank those who have worked to create a modest , serious , legal and practical measure with an important impact , one which will help others to create even more effective measures in future .
Make it clear that you will have a lock and you will prevent that type of opportunism which will in the end break Schengen .

I believe that sport has the power to transform lives .
The wording originally said &apos; non-fire fire period &apos; , and that did not make any sense to us , so we changed it to &apos; cease-fire fire &apos; .

I would also like to end the subsidization by the European Union of tobacco .
I would like to ask the Commissioner what happens when one article of the Treaty is in direct contradiction with other articles in the Treaty ; as Stephen Hughes has asked , how do we decide on the hierarchy ?

The EU solution is to throw millions of euros at renovating and building thousands of houses .
It is not growing .

2009 will see the impact of the Lisbon Treaty - if indeed it is ratified by all Member States .
I also want to thank my shadow , Mr Hasse Ferreira , for working with me , and he has also contributed extensively .
I would appreciate your views .
This shows that your contributions can be very helpful , because already some very important points have been made .
I just wondered whether you agree with me that his continued support for Britain to join the euro , his surrender of GBP 2 billion a year of the British rebate and his whole approach towards Britain &apos; s membership of the European Union - his refusal to give the British a referendum - all show that he has sufficient pro-European European credentials to become the President ?
In that time I have dealt with 12 cases and almost daily requests for information and for help .
Secondly , the focus of the report is on legal restrictions on racist and xenophobic beliefs and not on the actions motivated by racism and xenophobia .
Unfortunately the position is not hopeful at the moment insofar as the United Kingdom is concerned , but who can tell what might happen .
This is in spite of a large American-led led counter-insurgency insurgency force which operates in parallel to ISAF .
The move to impose such a landlord model on United Kingdom ports will be enormously damaging .
Hopefully , it will receive the overwhelming support of this House tomorrow .
The health check simply provides an opportunity to streamline and simplify the common agricultural policy , in line with the 2003 CAP reform .
Urging the Member States to coordinate their actions , I also support the idea to set up the Missing Child Alert System which would improve the cooperation on this issue on the European level .

The report from our Agricultural Committee also includes amendments to extend grant aid for producing flax and hemp to non-arable arable land , thus providing opportunities to diversify areas of the European Union unable to obtain monetary support under the present regime .
Another pillar from the digital agenda is dedicated to digital skills .
However , while recognising that Member States need to retain flexibility over their own tax systems , any tool or aid that can support our industries and consumers to make greener choices is to be welcomed , and our policies must be such that they incentivise behavioural change .
If that requires them working part-time time , so be it .
This amendment revises the convention to bring it more into line with other regional conventions and international instruments .

But even schoolchildren know that the comical rulers of Saudi Arabia , consisting mostly of the family of one man , His Most Royal Excellency godlike King Abdullah , are imposing on their people a brutal repression .

Another bloody attack could take place at any moment .
Then the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs set out its views after extensive discussions with my services .
In the short term , it is a sad fact that , because of the current state of overcapacity in the car industry , any plan to restore the profitability of Opel / Vauxhall will require job losses across the company as a whole and planned closures ; all the plans to save Opel / Vauxhall presented by different potential investors have foreseen both plant closures and job cuts .
Fourthly , we wish to deal with the Council in terms of foreign policy and security .
In some cases , this may mean allowing the adoptions to proceed .

As I said , we sent it as an Article 133 document to the INTA Committee .
Moreover , the Irish scheme gives priority to the decommissioning of those vessels targeting sensitive white fish stocks , while giving vessel owners already facing reduced quotas , higher fuel costs etc. the opportunity to leave the sector .

This is not the case , however , in Bangladesh , where Mr Choudhury has been put on trial and could be executed for his articles .
The Commission is beginning to show the way forward , but if we are serious about it we are going to have to put the money behind our political intentions .

However , as the work of the round table on sustainable palm oil has demonstrated , the environmental impact of palm oil production can display enormous variations , and this has to be taken into account .
But , above all , there is the heterogeneity , the lack of national feeling , the lack of linguistic or ethnic unity of purpose .
While many of us who voted or campaigned for a &apos; yes &apos; vote are disappointed in the result , I think it is important that we reflect on that result .

The first - and , for me , the most important set of reasons - is the need for the European Union to be credible in delivering the renewed Lisbon Agenda on growth and jobs .
The summit showed a willingness to get back to the business of Europe .
I cannot go back to my region tomorrow and tell my people that they do not need to worry , that we have a plan for 2020 .

And why is it that they charge more for the same drugs in Africa , than they charge in the northern hemisphere ?
Secondly , if they continue enriching , the question is why ? - because they do not have anywhere to put it , no other power plant .
Those of you in the Competitiveness Council could take that initiative next time you meet .
We should not only discuss the political priorities but also how these can be translated into budgetary language which can be implemented .

Madam President , I would like to refute the comments from across the floor and say that there are totally inappropriate .
Considerable concern was also expressed by the Commission and by a number of Member States in Council .
My fear is that this will just be a self-fulfilling fulfilling prophesy .
Why be so afraid of growth ?
Ireland unfortunately did not opt into the 2003 Directive , and operates a &apos; direct provision &apos; system , providing accommodation , food and EUR 19.10 per week per adult , designed to discourage asylum seekers from choosing Ireland , and keeping them out of the official labour market for the entirety of their application procedure .

It is time to create a new consensus on EU enlargement policy , based on the consolidation of our commitments , rigorous application of conditionality and better communication with our citizens .
The European Parliament should reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of prisoners of conscience in Cuba - 55 according to Amnesty International , 200 according to Cuba &apos; s Human Rights Commission - and we should express particular concern today for the recent detention and beating of Darsi Ferrer , director of a health and human rights centre in Havana .

Mrs Theato very clearly indicated that , of course , there is also the question of the institutional balance between Parliament and the Council .
