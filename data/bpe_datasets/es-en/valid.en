This agreement - as the Commissioner quite rightly pointed out - takes a similar approach to the Association Agreement with Mexico which has lead to an increase in commercial transactions since its entry into force and which is an agreement which goes much further than these requirements , since it provides for the liberalisation of 100 % of transactions , many going much further than the forecasts established in the negotiations of the World Trade Organisation .
However , we often forget human biodiversity , one of the main manifesta@@ tions of which are the different languages and cultures which are sometimes not respected or protected , but rather there is simply an attempt to eliminate them , for the sake of the commercial convenience of uniformity and glob@@ alising tendencies .
I am one of the people who have often reminded the Commission that it should deal with this issue as soon as possible .
I cannot , however , accept the implicit censure of religious values and actual religion that the Izquierdo report makes , under cover of its censure of fundamentalism - and not only in relation to Christi@@ an@@ ity .
Does the Council not believe that the time has come to draft an overall policy for comprehensive food security and for that food security policy to be one of the general policies of the European Union so as to ensure that this type of mass famine does not recu@@ r in the future ?
Although I am aware that the second pillar of the common agricultural policy provides support for projects relating to women &apos; s living conditions in rural areas , I believe it necessary to analyse the projects underway in order to identify sound practices and contribute to improving the situation of women , which is especially affected by the consequences of the current structural crisis of the capitalist system in rural areas . This is especially true when we take into account the high levels of female unemployment , to which we must add the fact that many women do not even take part in the labour market , meaning that they are not registered as unemployed and do not feature in unemployment statistics .
Mr Solbes is no mere altar bo@@ y ; he is a high priest , and has a fundamental role - that of spe@@ ar@@ head , like Saint Vic@@ ente Ferrer - in this process of reform .
What I cannot understand is why , in the economic boom years back in 2005 @-@ 2006 , the financial perspectives that were approved were so pared back and limited that the annual budgetary policy could not be used as a coun@@ terc@@ yclical weapon .
If you will allow me to use the expression , there is a &apos; free bar &apos; in terms of considering constitutional models .
To date , no one has recognised his error , and the blame has instead been placed on the United States .
Today , the ri@@ gh@@ tness of our stance is based not only on proper parliamentary procedures or Parliament &apos; s unavoidable duties .
These women have practically no access to contr@@ acep@@ tion and forced marriages and poverty are also part of their reality .
My vote in support of the de Ve@@ y@@ rac report on the application of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Na@@ tural Heritage in the Member States of the European Union is based on the conviction that we must enhance the cultural dimension of the European Union . We must work to ensure we have a cultural policy in the Union which highlights , among the main features of its spiritual rich@@ ness and that of the O@@ ld World , its cultural , linguistic , architec@@ tural and artistic diversity and all those elements that make up our common cultural heritage .
This is a crucial and decisive time for transport .
The Committee on Fisheries approved Amendment 1 - I see the rapporteur is against separating the two species - and I hope the House will adopt it .
This is a challenge for everybody that requires a process of economic and social reform on an unprecedented scale .
We agree with the wishes of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , although we regret that we cannot support its proposals , since they have not been presented in the form of amendments to the legislative text , as is always required in these cases .
Which inspectors are going to deal with it ?
What about Portugal ?
And I would draw this Parliament &apos; s attention , since this is the place where the political notion of Europe must progress , to those who are attacking us by means of internal allies .
This approach is particularly important for &apos; at risk &apos; groups .
It must encourage support for the media who seek to provide true information and remain independent of the public authorities . Society must be strengthened through citizens &apos; associations , professional organisations and trade unions .
Seville will have to pay attention , among other matters , to the approval of the Sixth R &amp; D Framework Programme , the EU &apos; s common strategy for Johannesburg , the new e @-@ Europe 2005 programme , and the reform of the Council in addition to the discussions regarding enlargement .
However , I do not believe I am being over @-@ optimistic if I say that the European Union is har@@ vesting the fruits of coordinated and persistent action .
Sex@@ ual exploitation is the main objective of the mafias that traffic human beings , followed by forced labour , domestic service , forced marriages , exploitation of children for beg@@ ging , illegal adoption and the removal of organs , which are other scour@@ ges and aspects of the problem .
I therefore confirm what has been said by the rapporteur , Mrs Haug , and also Mr Garriga , in this respect .
We are therefore arriving at a final proposal that we consider to be both reasonable and ambitious .
Furthermore , the Commission should consider producing more measures in the field of energy performance and also of more renewable energy sources because , as you stated on 26 August , Mrs Wallström , if all the public authorities of the European Union were to move over to ecological energy , CO2 production would be reduced by 62 million tonnes , which would allow us to comply with the 18 % Kyoto commitments in the field of emissions reduction .
The proposal contains a series of suggestions that would facilitate the implementation of different policies and market instruments that go further than those that focus exclusively on the environment and that , I think , will make it easier for a future White Paper to be more detailed and better developed .
Is it pure chance that on these two occasions the supposed reply supports the positions of the Spanish Government ?
The governing Regulation No 850 / 98 entered into force on 1 January of this year , but it must obviously continue to be periodically adapted to incorporate any new data and scientific innovations which may emerge .
Without the information provided by the parliaments and equality bodies , we would not have been able to write this report , at least not as thoroughly as we have done ; nor would it have been possible without the mutual collaboration that we have been able to establish with the Commission , or without the invaluable help provided by the services of the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Gender Equality , my office and the services of my parliamentary group .
To achieve this , we must focus attention on Member States so that - as Spain has done , beyond transposing the Council &apos; s framework decision on this matter , - we can develop and implement action plans in which interest groups are involved , including public awareness and social mobilisation programmes , without neglecting to work on international cooperation .
In fact , the first death from doping took place in 18@@ 96 , when a cycli@@ st took drugs .
Mr President , I wish to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council for the reply .
Finally , Prime Minister , we Spanish will not accept being denied the ability to make proposals .
The problem is not simply one of assessing the actual economic and technical contents of the European Council .
We also wish to see these publici@@ sed on the Internet , so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point .
There must also be increasing cooperation between intelligence services and a strengthening of Europol .
Does the Commission think that it can guarantee the plan &apos; s success bearing in mind that , although there are only few nets left , its control - as the Commission itself has claimed - would actually be quite difficult ?
Madam President , I am going to talk about the renewed social agenda .
One of the failings of the MEDA Plan , one of the causes of the delay in incorporating the countries of the Mediterranean into European policy , or into the offer that we are making , is the need for these to be accepted according to their own logic , to their own scale and with a new sensitivity and a new way of addressing problems .
SMEs are the sector which can create more jobs in the European Union and we will be doing them , and their workers , a good service if we reduce administrative burdens and apply a better and smart regulation approach .
We have tried to fundamentally change the coherence of policies and the evaluation of their implementation , thereby contributing to progress in the increase in growth potential , the creation of more and better jobs , an improvement in social cohesion and sustainable development .
Allow me to remind you about the conclusions on Croatia adopted by the Council in December .
The PPE Group is pleased that on 1 October the European Union was able to decide on joint action committing the Union and its Member States to work together for the conclusion of the desired international agreement .
Mr President , more international troops died in Afghanistan in June than in Iraq .
I know that the Commission will not be able to give me a reply on this question , but I am drawing the attention of the House and the Commissioner to the problem that this will cause with regard to Community cohesion policies .
This is currently being worked out in practice through the thirty trans @-@ European network projects , which , like the Lisbon Strategy , have until now suffered from a certain degree of apa@@ thy and from funding problems on the Member States &apos; side .
Mr President , before I begin my intervention on this report , I should like to ask that it be recorded in the Minutes that in accordance with Rule 16@@ 1 of the Rules of Procedure the explanatory statement in the report under discussion is the responsibility of the rapporteur alone and only reflects her personal opinion , not the opinion of the Committee on Industry .
Regrettably , this is a case which , as we have recently witnessed with another Belgian company , is taking place in large companies , due to the restructuring of these companies and the relations which currently exist in the economic world .
Full employment , according to the Commission &apos; s initial document - which formed the basis of the Lisbon decision - is something which can be achieved as long as the proposed policies are implemented .
We want an end to the bad habit of accepting solemn political commitments that cannot possibly be funded .
I would also point out that we have created an International Criminal Court which must have a role to play , although it is not supported by some States , including Israel .
Let us hope that it represents a road and not an inn .
That is what we are talking about .
Mr President , this is an important directive .
As we all know , a Community vessel that was operating in NAFO waters , the Santa M@@ af@@ al@@ da , has been ordered into the Portuguese port of A@@ ve@@ iro with Canadian NAFO inspectors on board .
As well as my opposition to this militar@@ istic foreign affairs philosophy , my reason for voting against it is that the most basic principles of transparency and democracy have been absent throughout the process of creating the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) .
V@@ ague statements and half @-@ truths simply will not do any longer .
Commissioner , producers are quite dis@@ concerted by information that has been circu@@ lated , from which it can be deduced that there will be changes to the system established in 2003 for the milk sector and specifically concerning the quota system .
President Prodi has already made due reference to this subject .
Mr Mitchell , with respect to the issue of lif@@ ts , which you have raised , I would like to reveal something which may be a secret part of the Bureau &apos; s debates .
The Member States of the European Union respect fundamental rights .
These are the two questions as I understand them , Madam President .
Generally speaking , the evolution of public finances in the Economic and Monetary Union since the pact came into force has moved in the right direction , but , as Mr Karas said , there are too many countries , ten at the moment , in a situation of excessive deficit ; some Member States of the Union have levels of public debt compared to their gross domestic product above the 60 % reference value laid down in the Treaty , and we therefore need to reflect and seek improvements in the application of the pact , and we need to strengthen the instruments we rely on to make this framework for fiscal governance a success .
In this discussion Parliament has been more up to the job than the Council .
Mr President , in this year 2002 during which the international community has met succes@@ sively in Monterrey , Rome and Johannesburg , setting as a priority the challenge of leading two @-@ thirds of humanity out of the situation of hunger , poverty and under @-@ development that affects them , it seemed that the European Parliament was obliged to consider and adopt a position on how the European Union can support agricultural and rural development policies that contribute to the development of the countries of the South .
This is vitally important for consumers and companies .
And we left it that when the conflict ended we would revise the financial perspective .
Mr President , I took the liberty of writing to you last week on the situation in Central America .
There is huge concern for the effects of the volcan@@ ic cl@@ oud on the tourist industry .
We have fought a very significant democratic battle in the national parliaments - at least in mine - on security , in order to have complete control so that even any deployment of troops abroad must be subject to comprehensive parliamentary control .
And the third question : you spoke about the conference on peace in the region .
My second question is much more direct and perhaps more aw@@ k@@ ward . Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade , as highlighted by Mr Koch , does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy , given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment ?
The new tasks assigned to the Agency are intended to increase maritime safety and prevent pollution caused by ships in Member States &quot; waters .
Mrs Jiménez , Baroness Ashton , in order to arrive at a fair , sustainable and mutually acceptable solution , the referendum on self @-@ determination needs to be held .
The banana multinationals have a dark history of interference in Latin American politics .
Secondly , it has been claimed that the transitional arrangements create transitional inequality - to quote Mr Rothley . It is envisaged that Members will be able to choose different arrangements during the coming legislature .
Furthermore , Sir Leon says that investments are not going to be prohibited , but inhibi@@ ted .
Current rules stipulate that 10 % of the Fund &apos; s resources be allocated to these tasks .
The Commission does not think that the situation in the sector justifies this . However , in recent months , there has been a continuous decline in prices , and the prices received by breeders are below the average for the last five years .
The proposal now presented to Parliament includes the provisions of the common position which the Council had approved previously , as well as the amendments approved by the European Parliament at second reading .
I believe that the Commission is doing good work , but our main concern at the moment is the maintenance of fishing activity and , specifically , activity which does not lead to over @-@ fishing , but rather the conservation of natural resources .
I believe that time limits should be reduced , otherwise we will lose credibility .
Despite the economic boom of recent years , however , this is not the best time for Latin America in terms of its integration . This is what President Óscar Arias said at his inaugur@@ ation and I was reminded of it last weekend at a seminar organised in S@@ ão Pau@@ lo with Alejandro Toledo , the former President of Peru , and Fernando Enrique Car@@ do@@ so , the former President of Brazil .
Furthermore , finally , do not leave the secretariat of the Convention to the Council ; we must all participate in it , because a broader distribution always brings the best results .
I am sorry that I am not able to finish ; I will conclude this dialogue with Mr Huhne , now by letter and I hope , later on , orally .
I agree with the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council that it is absolutely essential to maintain intact and un@@ harmed the dogmas of price stability and budgetary austerity , both for the large countries and for the small ones .
Firstly , the safety of eight nuclear power stations in three candidate countries is giving cause for concern . The Commission has called for their closure at the earliest possible stage of the enlargement process .
Furthermore , this proposal is certain to have a beneficial impact on quality strategy .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets . - Mr President , I am conve@@ ying the opinion of the Committee on Budgets , for which I was draftsman , on the proposal to amend the regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development . The proposal forms part of the European Economic Recovery Plan .
I would like to emphasise that significant sums , about EUR 44 million , were allocated to this aid project in both 2001 and 2002 , and that the Commission has told us the results of the programme for those two years . It gives me particular pleasure to say , firstly , that efforts to diversify production increased during that period , and , secondly , that those efforts were based on incentives for agricultural and rural development projects .
Here there is a political will to create a conflict with the Council and not to respect our word .
Mr S@@ as@@ sol@@ i , if you wish to proceed with your request , there are , of course , other courses of action open to you , under the Rules of Procedure , such as an oral amendment or , of course , a vote against the above @-@ mentioned amendments .
Firstly , I would like to say that this is a laudable and courageous piece of work , because subsidiarity is a stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket which is holding Europeans back despite the brilli@@ ance of their desires and their minds . Nevertheless , it lacks a parallel project , which is concerned with human resources .
We therefore support the resolution which will be put to the vote in the House today . We urge the Commission to play an active role in these processes of regional integration , demonstrating strong support for and solidarity with Latin America , and facilitating the emergence of stable , democratic and highly developed societies .
It is one of the most exclusive clubs in the world .
I have told you , ladies and gentlemen , we have already initiated a series of proceedings in some Member States .
I am delighted , though it involved quite considerable work and debate , that the reference to health has been removed when it comes to refusing to sell tickets to disabled persons , or those with reduced mobility , with safety now becoming the only reason for such refusal .
Mr President , I would just like to say that my Group supports the groups that put forward the motion for a joint resolution and will endorse it .
With the compromise that I proposed yesterday to the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries , which that committee has approved , my intention is not to delay the report but to speed it up so that it may be available in this House in May and so that we can conclude this issue under ideal conditions , since the first deadline for the first financial compensation ends on 30 June .
Mr President , the very positive assessment that we are making today of the meeting in New York , should not allow us to forget that there have been serious deficiencies and great hypocrisy , even within the European Union , which make me want to double my efforts from now on .
To whom ? And above all , please , please call things by their real name .
Madam President , like the rapporteur , we are in principle in favour of enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , since we believe that a united Europe is inconceivable without their participation .
The European Union should make it a priority to help keep that process going , to help it succeed .
Because it is based on a Commission proposal which I believe was ro@@ tten from the outset .
I know what democracy is because I had the good fortune to grow up in a country like Sweden which has a long democratic tradition .
Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioners Wulf @-@ Mathies and Van Miert for their presence here today .
As a conclusion to today &apos; s debate , I can make an optimistic observation : the euro zone is growing again , despite the fact that some said that it was a zone of very low growth .
The second point was more serious .
I do not need to remind you that , in Europe , the poultry sector does not receive any direct support from the CAP , despite the fact that since 1997 our producers have been banned from using the very same substances that the Commission now wants to authorise , and moreover they are submitted to exhaustive controls throughout the production cycle to prevent the development of bac@@ teria and to comply with the high Community hygiene standards .
It is true that there are some programmes that we always use as references , such as Socrates or Leonardo , but in precisely these programmes , we must recognise the lack of sufficient resources to achieve the scope and effect that we would like .
Also with a view to this type of cooperation , during this six @-@ month period , the Strategic Committee on Immigration , Borders and Asylum has met for the first time , with the participation of the Heads of the External B@@ order Control Services .
We are then told that we could provide the DAS by sector .
To sum up , as Mr Fantuzzi said , I think that we should end our discussions and fine words and start taking practical action .
As Commissioner De Gucht has explained , the Commission put forward some negotiation directives for the purposes of concluding an association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur , which were adopted by the Council and by Parliament .
A peace conference cannot start from nothing .
The average European team has no more than six people , whilst an American team consists of 24 people .
We can accept this definition or any other .
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million , but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 6@@ 13 million .
That is why the proposal launched by the Sam@@ per Government to initiate talks between the conflicting parties should receive the support of all the Union &apos; s institutions , which in their debates on many occasions have demonstrated enormous concern for the future of that country .
I am sorry to contradict the Commissioner , but oil is still reaching the Galician beaches - and particularly those in Can@@ tábrico - and there are even very substantial la@@ yers of oil below the sand itself .
I therefore believe that nobody is going to argue about the legal basis in the Euratom Treaty for all the proposals I have made to the Council and Parliament , because the Court has said it loud and clear .
Mr President , I would like to point out the differences that exist in some respects between the position of the Spanish Socialists and that of our political group .
In trying to perform an in @-@ depth study of the principles of the 1992 reform , none of the institutions can allow themselves to ignore its effects , which were negative in many cases .
Furthermore , I would like to know whether you are personally going to be in Vienna for the meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly that we are going to hold next week , because that is where we are going to be able to talk to our African , Caribbean and Pacific colleagues about the issue of the EP@@ As , for example , and I would also suggest and request that observers from the ACP @-@ EU Joint Assembly and the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Assembly be invited to the Rabat Conference , because I believe that the presence of these parliamentarians will have ...
This family immigration consists of both family reunification in the strict sense - the reunification of family members with a third @-@ country national who is already resident - and the reunification of a family when the family ties are established after the entry of the third @-@ country national .
It cannot only be a summit on immigration nor , of course , only on security .
Mr President , the term of the agreement with Mauritania will expire in one year &apos; s time and we are already making preparations for a new agreement .
We need to consider a wide range of instruments in our efforts to attain financial and monetary stability .
In addition , the amendments introduced refer to animal welfare standards on the farm and during transport , and emergency solutions are proposed for cases of serious health crises which prevent animal movements for long periods , such as buying @-@ in schemes , which the Commission has certainly never done before .
Secondly , it is urgent that we increase the number of staff dedicated to humanitarian aid activities .
In a globalised market , the EU must meet the challenges it faces .
The only one in the whole of the European Union is a country of Central and Eastern Europe and one of the new Member States .
Therefore , although I realise that the directive includes some highly positive points , I believe it sometimes goes too far , which is why I abstained .
Firstly , the broad guidelines of economic policy are confirmed as a fundamental element .
We will thus save ourselves from disgraceful situations in which certain people in power criticise the positions of some governments and have to praise the positions of others .
I think it would be recognition of European cultures and literature for this Parliament to agree to join in these celebrations on a cultural and liter@@ ary day which is so widely celebrated in the European Union .
It must be obligatory for the governments of the constitutional entities to participate in the meetings of the Council when issues are being dealt with which affect their exclusive competences , as in the case of taxation in the Basque Country .
I would like to make a few comments on the greatest challenge for this Presidency , which , in my opinion , will be the reform of the financial perspectives , which you , Mr Juncker , mentioned in passing .
Inclu@@ de it in your Presidency .
The Commission is not in favour of changing this date because , although the stability programme stipulates that a situation of balance must be achieved in the medium term , this medium term was initially set for 2002 and has now been extended to 2004 .
In the past , workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival . Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant .
It has involved one year of work , 1 100 amendments and 120 commitments , with 11 parliamentary committees and 10 national parliaments having contributed to it .
We cannot , Mr President , apply the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact to Portugal to the letter and then exoner@@ ate other larger countries .
A fairer society - in a European Union in which 42 % of working people are women - cannot tolerate an under @-@ representation of women in the bodies and structures within which social interlocu@@ tors meet to define , regulate and agree on issues relating to social policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Si@@ fun@@ akis , on his work , which stresses the specific nature and importance of European natural , cultural and artistic heritage , which generates many benefits , social and cultural as well as environmental and economic .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is the time to send two clear messages .
Unless we consider this report within the correct context , we will be la@@ shing out in the dark .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I too would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their efforts to seek a consensus amongst the groups with regard to establishing the mandate for negotiating the association agreements with Central America and the Andean region .
I would like to congratulate the House on the debate and the reports that have been presented to it this evening .
Nevertheless , despite the fact that it is extremely difficult to find money for these purposes , world military spending between 2002 and 2003 increased by USD 64 000 million , and between 2003 and 2004 a further USD 50 000 million had to be added .
Prime Minister , I warmly congratulate you on your ambitious programme of action against gender violence , which is a social scourge .
It is also important to strengthen the competitiveness of the service industry and to introduce the changes needed to prolong working life . I would like to comment briefly on each of these aspects .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you have not answered my questions on the maritime areas located between the Canaries , Madeira , the Azores and the European Union .
These two Members have already explained far better than I could the technical and legal reasons why they advocate rejection of this proposal . I should , however , like to refer to a matter which seems to me to be of the highest political importance .
There should also be immediate 100 % compensation for the animals slaugh@@ tered on these farms .
The prevention side includes mechanisms such as an annual review of fiscal balances , early warning mechanisms from the European Commission and prevention recommendations to address minor imbalances .
In short , an opportunity cost analysis .
Nonetheless , the European Union continued to argue in defence of its intention to pursue compensation further as the key to protecting its rights .
I believe and hope that we can achieve a resolution along similar lines .
In conclusion , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would remind you that the proposals we are discussing today are the result of one year &apos; s work by a high @-@ level group , made up of civilian and military representatives from the Member States of the Union , and of a social group consisting of the various agents in the civil aviation sector and also with participation at all levels of this field .
Ad@@ mit that you wanted to make permanent what was temporary in 1993 , and admit that you wanted to turn what was exceptional into something normal .
It is in this context of the international community , all working together , that it makes sense to talk about observers , that it makes sense to talk about peacekeeping forces , because , otherwise , these things would not be feasible ; and that is when it makes sense for us to talk about Marshall plans and economic contributions - which will have to be considerable , of course - and that we also talk about the full import of the rapprochement of the two peoples on the basis , amongst other things , of their educational systems .
As for the fiscal aspect , an issue that has been much discussed in recent times , the Commission understands the concerns of the professional sectors most affected by the sudden increase in oil prices .
The latest hostages include two of our fellow citizens : the German , Sus@@ anne Os@@ th@@ off , a ren@@ owned archa@@ e@@ olog@@ ist , who has been integrated into Iraqi society for ten years - and is not therefore a person who can in any way be linked to military operations - and who , since the beginning of the war , has been entirely committed to helping the Iraqi people .
The minimum size set for oc@@ to@@ pus bears no relation to the size set for ad@@ jac@@ ent areas ; the additional two @-@ month biological recovery period negotiated at the last minute , virtually un@@ be@@ known to the fisheries sector , was based on a poor quality scientific report and was introduced at the request of the Mauritanian party without the necessary prior consultation of the joint scientific committee ; it is based solely on cephalopo@@ ds , despite the fact that the recovery period affects all categories . All of this is a disturbing indication of how the European Commission sometimes negotiates .
Having said this , it is undeniable that in Europe , in the European Union , it is the Council that wi@@ el@@ ds the most legislative power and , furthermore , controls executive power through the comitology procedure .
A mis@@ placed focus on enlargement , added to the social consequences of the so @-@ called Stability Pact , and the conditions for nominal convergence , could become a serious obstacle to job creation , both in the Member States and in the candidate countries .
The H@@ 5 virus has spread amongst wild and domestic birds , and migratory birds are spreading it all over the place .
We will be laying great stress on research into renewable energies in the framework programme on research and development . I think that is the first step .
He thinks it is completely normal to have double standards in terms of the benefits of agreements for the North or for the South .
I would like to return this compli@@ ment because , during my years of experience in this House , I had never known a Prime Minister to appear three times during a Presidency , but he has done just that .
Finally I should like , Mr President , to point out that there is an article - article 2 - which states that all of this is aimed at achieving political integration .
All the other immigrants , whether looking for work , refugees , or whatever , are second class human beings with increasingly limited fundamental rights .
The Maghreb representatives are constantly telling us that they will do nothing about immigration until the European Union offers them clear compensa@@ tions .
But that is happening in the part of the island occupied by the United States : in the base at Guantánamo .
The vo@@ y@@ age of hope could end up becoming a cur@@ sed vo@@ y@@ age , and it will be on the consciences of all of us who witness these continuous uncontrolled influ@@ xes and do not say &apos; enough is enough &apos; with sufficient authority .
But we also need credible , and therefore well financed , external European activities .
In this respect , the Committee on Fisheries considered that the hake and cod situations are different , and that hake should have different measures from cod , which should be adopted based on confirmed scientific reports .
In the Lamassoure report , we are defending the competences allocated to the EU .
We must not forget that had that not been the case , the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea would quite simply have obtained enough pluton@@ ium to manufacture dozens of nuclear bombs .
I hope and expect that all these positions in particular , together with others contained in the amendments tabled by my group , will receive the support of the majority in this House .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like - as others have done - to begin by acknowledging the work of our rapporteur , Mrs Miguélez Ramos , on an issue which was frankly difficult - as we all know - given the conflicting positions and interests in this field .
The Commission believes that it cannot .
The Socialists and the PP tried to pressur@@ ise their fellow Members to vote in favour of their respective resolutions , which greatly miti@@ g@@ ated the criticisms made by the rapporteur .
Therefore , we ask you to allocate resources to fundamental programmes such as employment programmes and youth training programmes or to the programme that has been torn to sh@@ reds by the Court of Justice , the most deprived persons programme .
It also obliges ships to notify the port that they are going to deliver waste prior to their arrival in the port , and to pay the cost of the reception facilities .
Mr President , as the rapporteur , Mr Leinen , explained very effectively , there are many of us who think that the Intergovernmental Conference should begin a genuine constitutionalisation process for the European Union .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the historic decision to introduce the euro , to launch the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union , a decision that was adopted by the European Council meeting from 1 to 3 May 1998 .
Also of concern is the repression of sectors which have been sti@@ g@@ mati@@ sed by the regime , such as homosexuals and certain intellectuals .
However , these difficulties , particularly where linked to the type of coin or note currently being supplied by cash dispen@@ sers , could be solved .
However , we are aware that certain people favour the alternative plan proposed by the Council , which does not support the trus@@ tee concept and intends to propose a separate vote .
We , in Parliament , must therefore decisively support the work of our representatives , both here and in the Middle East .
Pas@@ sing on to other matters , I would like to reply to Mr Pohjamo that Directive 96 / 35 on safety advisers , which will enter into force on 1 January 2000 , will contribute to the application of the legislation on the transport of dangerous goods , and make it more transparent and more in line with our intentions .
The protocols that periodically renew the agreements have been adapted to the true situation , to the quantities of fish actually caught and the state of resources in those fishing grounds .
We must take enormous care not to confuse the two things and as a result prevent the exercise or development of creativity by computer .
In fact ; it has already had effects .
Amendments Nos 12 and 34 go further in the definition of environmentally viable transport than that established at the Gothenburg European Council .
Of course it is a very useful tool but we must not fail to mention that it also has weaknesses .
In this regard , the innovative nature of the mechanism , for the majority of Member States , means that in the majority of cases it is approached from the point of view of learning by doing , and that there are differences of opinion in terms of the best way to make its application a success .
With regard to the Constitution , Mr President , I believe that what is going to happen in practice , which is the suspension of the referenda , is a good thing : this is not the right time to hold more referenda and we must dedicate ourselves to debate .
Mr President , it should not surprise anyone , particularly if they have any legal training , that the control of the application of Community law should fall to the Committee on Legal Affairs .
MAGPs are essential to achieving the level of resources needed to ensure that fishing can be a sustainable activity with a future within the European Union and any infringement of their provisions must be punished .
And from the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs , the rapporteur in particular has had the greatest sympathy for the efforts of the Commission and Commissioner Byrne to bring forward this proposal for a directive which , as he has said , is much more modest than the previous one .
There can be no concessions for terrorism .
We need to strengthen a more mature civil society and democratic institutions that act as a counter@@ point , as well as strengthening the surveillance and control mechanisms over public activities and the fight against corruption in all of its gu@@ ises . These are goals that are not only worth fighting for but which , within our committee , inspire our daily work .
I will not hide from you the fact that the situation is not easy , and that we are going to experience a certain degree of tension in the next few days , but everyone needs to keep calm so that the situation does not develop into a serious conflict .
Dublin can indeed be perfec@@ ted , but a great deal more needs to be done .
Mr President , as you know , the enlargement of the European Union to include another country is always a dial@@ ec@@ tical process in which the candidate &apos; s efforts must be determined but in which the Union &apos; s efforts must also be clear .
I would also like to highlight , as a fundamental contribution to the consolidation of the progress made until now , the promotion and maintenance of rigorous regulations on health and safety at work , which has been one of the most prominent issues in the debate held in the Commission , which advocates better jobs in Europe .
In this vote , Members will vote as representatives of the people of Europe , free from any pressure from national governments . The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left will make its decision on the basis of the commitments made by the candidate regarding his general political outlook and a clear programme of reform for the Commission itself .
To respond to that question I want to make clear the first agreed point . There can be no sustainable growth without a stable macro@@ economy .
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning women &apos; s rights in Afghanistan .
A scandal .
Amongst other issues , this report will have to deal with promoting reuse and , in particular , compare the costs and benefits of reuse and recycling .
Where does national interest come in when it is a case of one judge in the European Union asking for the cooperation of another judge in the European Union ?
Mr President , Mr Evans - whom I congratulate on his report - was absolutely right when he said that this is a very important issue , although it is also true that questions relating to the reform procedure in the field of competition do not inspire interest amongst the citizens , despite their importance for the economic world .
I must point out that , as a member of the great Arab Maghreb , that country , Libya , is part of the Maghreb Delegation to the European Parliament , and is working indirectly on Euro @-@ Mediterranean policy here in this very building in Strasbourg , where more than one meeting has been held .
I very much hope that by the time we meet again in June , the Council &quot; s common position will be as close as possible to the proposal put forward by Parliament itself . Ad@@ option of the text at second reading should then be fairly straightforward , always sup@@ posing it is not adopted at first reading .
Could you tell us the date when it was requested , as others have asked ?
You were an acting Commissioner and I would like to bor@@ row the metaphor of Mr Varela Suanzes @-@ Carpegna and tell you that you have a good bull , a mi@@ ura , to fight ; carry out good negotiations , bring them to a satisfactory conclusion , defend the interests of the European fishermen as the Moroccan Government will defend the interests of theirs .
It is positive that it brings to a close so many years of disputes in the World Trade Organisation , thus restoring tran@@ quil@@ lity to a sector that needs certainty and stability for the future above all else .
Three Maltese journalists have been hospi@@ tali@@ sed after being bru@@ tally attacked by hun@@ ters while simply doing their jobs alongside people who were protesting against this illegal practice .
In the case of the Convention , what is lacking is that many Member States have not yet ratified it , which is doing little to help the fight against terrorism or to protect freedoms .
We are not asking for miracles nor that a great s@@ ong and dance be made about what is going to be done , but simply that its management model be more transparent .
The European Union also needs to demonstrate its true weight in set@@ tings such as the World Trade Organization , where its stance has most often been one of passivity and renouncing its own position .
The Straits of Gibraltar and the Andalusian coasts are the silent witnesses of the tragic deaths of human beings .
And in this regard , Madam President , we ke@@ en@@ ly await the report to be presented by Mr Solana and which Mrs Neyts @-@ Uyttebroeck has announced .
We have asked an indicative appropriation of EUR 2 million to be approved for an information campaign on the CFP .
Mr President , Commissioner , first , I would have appreciated a clear answer from you as to whether it is your intention to give in to the Council &apos; s wishes , acknowledging - which I am grateful for - the problems regarding acceptance of the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon gives to Parliament .
However , I must criticise the fact that this resolution is being presented now when the deadline for this expires at 10 o &apos; clock in the morning .
I am going to have the pleasure of giving the floor to my compatriot , Mr Carnero González . He is another Member who will not be with us in the next term of office , and I would like to thank him publicly for the enormous efforts and extremely laudable work he has accomplished within the specific area and on the issue that we are dealing with here .
We do not want to be under any illu@@ sions , though .
Last year , all of the European institutions debated and agreed that Slovenia would join the euro zone on 1 January 2007 . Finally , we have this request from Cyprus and Malta , which I hope will be definitively approved by the European Council and Ecofin on 10 July .
The distortions in the dairy farming market mean that each supply chain cannot function effectively or fairly .
The polluter pays principle would be entirely jeopardised if the amendments approved on the proposal of the European Peoples &apos; Party within the Committee on Legal Affairs were adopted .
Naturally , we attach great importance to the Luxembourg Summit and we back the efforts of the President of the Commission . We especially support the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Juncker , in his drive to defend and take action in favour of real convergence - what he called the convergence of employment .
I believe that the European institutions can work together in this aspect , and we hope that the Commission can indeed help to resolve this dead@@ ly and long@@ standing conflict .
The Council would have to give its consent , of course .
Therefore , while recognising that it is necessary to modernise the administration , our concern is to guarantee those fundamental principles of Community administration , which is currently occupied by extremely competent officials , who , often at great personal sacrifice , have to move home in order to set up in Brussels and who receive remuneration which is appropriate to the efforts that this entails .
It is not sufficient that a product is intrinsically toxic . Even water can be fatal if consumed in an enormous enough quantity to cause dro@@ wning .
Mr President , some have said that the condemnation of Morocco is too mi@@ ld given the magnitude of the repression of human rights in the Sahara , where Morocco is nothing more than an occupying country , with no sovereignty or legal enti@@ tlement whatsoever .
The European Union is preparing to undertake a review of the CAP in 2003 , which could be the pre@@ lu@@ de to a more in @-@ depth reform planned for 2006 .
( It has played an important role from the start , and it is an idea that has repeatedly been supported by both the Spanish Presidency and the President of the European Council , Mr Van Rompuy , who has played a very special role . )
We believe that this is a fundamental element .
That , then , is what the Commission is doing to improve the human rights situation .
Secondly , since you opened this sitting with sympathy for the catastrophe in Italy , I would be grateful if you could also mention another enormous catastrophe - not in terms of human life , but in terms of people &apos; s liveli@@ ho@@ ods , and the unique European habi@@ tat of the Doñana national park .
Sadly , this is not just an isolated incident in a country where breaches of human rights , including women &apos; s rights , is achieving disturbing records .
We do not understand why there is this reticence about it and I hope that this resolution will at least help to change some minds .
And in 2010 we shall be close to 3 % of GDP devoted to research , development and innovation , we will have applied the working programme to educational systems , the reconciliation of the labour market and family life , and we will have achieved a gradual increase in the effective European retirement age .
The reason is that an aspect which is fundamental to us , and I believe also to many European citizens , has not been considered as fully as we had asked for .
Thus I feel able to announce the support of the Socialist Group , with a request that the rapporteur take into account some of the main amendments we have tabled , in due accordance with the ideals of a left @-@ wing group .
I believe , therefore , that all the pre@@ conditions for peace have been placed on the table by the European Union , as was made quite clear here in the debate we had yesterday . Con@@ tac@@ ts are continuing , and we hope that decisions may come out of today &apos; s meeting that will allow us to achieve an immediate ceasefire and start peace talks straight away to re @-@ establish order between Palestine and Israel .
I also want to mention Mr Linkohr &apos; s initiative , very briefly because time is short .
Mr President , Commissioner , now the European Commission wants to allow chic@@ ken from the USA treated with ble@@ ach and , moreover , it wants us to accept it without complaining in order to improve trade relations with the United States .
We in this Parliament must be firm with regard to the proposal to lower the threshold for mobilising the Fund from EUR 3 000 to 1 000 million in damage caused . Thanks to this measure , it will be easier to use the Fund than it has been up to now .
We ask that , as part of the interim review of Agenda 2000 , there should be compulsory and uniform modulation of aid under the first pillar .
We therefore need common sense and prudence on this issue .
And on the other , that the financial perspectives must be accepted by the European Parliament and that Ecofin &apos; s proposals simply establish a consultation with Parliament .
Terrorism cannot be dealt with in a generalised fashion .
At this point , please allow me to briefly refer to something that was said here today .
Japanese and Korean practices aimed at corner@@ ing markets , their State aid and , in short , their unfair practices and disregard for standards that attempt to regulate the sector at a global level should all make us think carefully .
A port of refuge must be a port with special facilities , easily accessible , so that a vessel with manoeuvring difficulties can access it during difficult storms .
What we need is a European industrial policy .
Mr Albertini , you have four minutes for your two speeches .
There are centres operating in this area already , like the centre in London or the network set up to monitor AIDS .
I would like to congratulate the workers on their commitment to productivity , the Spanish directors and the engine@@ ers for their good work , and the regional government , headed by its President , Marcelino Igl@@ esi@@ as , for its support .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports this proposed regulation on the renewal of the fisheries agreement with Madagascar .
Furthermore , there are activities involving a different intensity of sound at different times , which must be considered and resolved .
To say we are fighting international terrorism means nothing .
With regard to Palestine , the European Union will continue to support President Abbas and the peace programme on the basis of which he was elected by an enormous , overwhelming , majority of Palestinian voters , and we must not forget that .
We have seen how good he is with the ball , because the Europe of sport is also a Europe that we have to build together .
Thirdly , following revision of the COM in 1998 and the end of intervention aid buying , aid to private storage became the only way of regulating market prices .
I believe that this demonstrates once again that the euro zone is not a closed club and that joining the euro is not just an obligation for the Member States , but an excellent opportunity for those who wish to share the single currency with 3@@ 18 million other Europeans and for the countries that already belong to the Economic and Monetary Union .
Mr President , firstly , on a point of order , I believe that immigration policy has many elements and I do not wish to discuss issues such as allocations in this report .
This will convince and guide many people and will increase the credibility of the European Parliament amongst the citizens of Europe .
Citizens are hoping that the Treaty of Lisbon will be implemented as quickly as possible after eight years of losing time through institutional uncertainties .
The European Parliament urges and encourages the Commission to redouble its efforts to convince the Member States - and would like to offer its assistance and support in doing so . We also call on the Commission to use all available resources to be more creative and to identify potential synergies between the three networks ( transport , energy and telecommunications ) in order to reduce costs and obtain adequate funding .
We are not a House of confrontation , as a national parliament would be , because we do not have a government here to support or oppose .
Mr Sy@@ lla - whom I respect and whom I thank personally - has made considerable efforts to ensure that the European Union &apos; s anti @-@ terrorist policy is well @-@ considered and supported by this Parliament .
A common border police team could possibly be put together , as has been suggested in the Justice and Home Affairs Councils , but this would be a common body of people recru@@ ited in the same way that , for example , we recru@@ it a common body of interpreters or officials in this House , that is to say , they would be Community officials bound by their own rules , with their own uniform and language system - which I can see is something you are concerned about - and which will surely have its own distinguishing marks and , most importantly , a code of conduct that will be common to all .
I would also like to refer to another issue which has appeared in the media and which causes a degree of concern , and that is the presence of security personnel on board aircraft which fly to the United States , an issue which raises all sorts of problems .
The 2020 strategy reflects the importance of training and education for successfully tackling the social and economic challenges facing us in the next decade .
Firstly , the internal debate amongst the Palestinians about the strategic significance of the inti@@ f@@ ada .
In fact , in an emotional tribute , we have just applauded one of the victims , José María Martín Carpena , whose life has been taken simply for having committed the crime of living and working in a peaceful and democratic country .
In a short space of time , the Commission and Commissioner Bolkestein have presented us with this communication on a strategy for the European internal market .
I also agree that dialogue should not be an end in itself .
This generation cannot and must not tolerate this situation , as some of our predeces@@ sors did by not facing up to the existence of death camps .
Let us hope therefore that we can move in that direction and that we can move relatively quickly , but I would emphasise once again that great energies are going to be required in order to progress along this path towards a definitive solution to the situation in Kosovo , which would unquestionably represent an essential step towards stability throughout the Balkan region , stability for the countries to which we have offered a future in Europe , at the Thessaloniki Summit and on numerous occasions .
I believe we also have to consider that work must be worthwhile ; we must have a system which provides incentives for participation in work and , to this end , it is essential to modernise the tax systems and also the social construction systems , as well as the legislation on work protection in order to favour employment .
All this takes time , and calls for cooperation between judges and police at international level , together with mutual political trust between governments . It will be a long and difficult process but believe me , it is the only way to defend democracy from fanaticism and barbar@@ ism .
The everyday life of a company , in this day and age , takes place within a global world - globalisation is the key word - a globalisation which does not exclusively affect large or very large companies , but also those of a small or medium size , because they are also having to function within this environment .
The rates they are charged will not be reduced as they should have been , even without taking liberalisation into account .
Finally , what do they think of the Goldstone report and its adoption by the United Nations Human Rights Council ?
His role has to be well and clearly separated from the role of the auditor who , and I finish with this , if he is to be anything , must be totally independent .
So@@ oner or later we will have to reach a permanent agreement , but first we will have to debate and clarify the issues selected at the Nice Council .
I voted for discharge of the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency for the financial year 2009 after seeing the analysis the Court of Auditors is undertaking , which states that its actions are legal and regular .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would of course like to thank Mr Staes for his excellent work as rapporteur , as well as the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , for their contributions to the debate on this proposal for a regulation .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m. , by way of exception , due to the presentation of the programme for the French Presidency .
Moldova &apos; s request only represents a small step , but it is at least of some significance .
Regarding ancho@@ vies , an example of how not to do things , the subject has been under discussion for more than one year and , unfortunately , it has become a debate on the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon grants to Parliament and on the legal basis for the Commission proposal , rather than a debate on what is better for fishermen , industries and fisheries .
In my capacity as rapporteur , I therefore wished to take advantage of the opportunity provided by consultation and present a political report on this plan and its implementation . Parliament should not be criticised for failing to put forward its opinion at a more appropriate moment as it was consulted at an impossible time .
I would like to say that I believe it is a mistake to compare air traffic with self @-@ handling .
In 2008 , the Council backed proposals by the Commission on deforestation and the Commission proposed that the loss of forest areas , which are continually disappearing at an extensive rate , be halted by 2030 at the latest , and that mass tropical deforestation be reduced by at least 50 % by 2020 compared to current levels .
Because , at the end of the day , that is what we are talking about : sending a message of confidence to the citizens , demonstrating that their welfare is a priority for the Union &quot; s institutions .
However , in all sincerity , Mr President , and following on from what Mr A@@ el@@ vo@@ et said , I am not content with this agenda .
For example , you state that 90 % of legislative activity is done through comitology .
With all of this in mind , the Commission makes concrete proposals in its communication to increase efficiency and coordination , to improve coherence and complementarity amongst the different processes and instruments , to stimulate our commitments and our &apos; ownership &apos; in relation to a greater involvement by Parliament and social partners , and increase the transparency and understanding of policy coordination and therefore its visibility and effects .
As the presidency has pointed out , slower growth will affect the nominal value of budgetary positions . De@@ par@@ ture from the objectives ought , however , to be limited .
Our policy on climate change is one of the key identifying characteristics of the European model .
The creation of a community where there are different levels of development would harm not only the less developed regions but also the more developed regions and sectors , as they would find that the levels of consumption would be too low in the regions with a lower purchasing power .
The truth is that as MEPs it has taken us a long time to have our own statute .
Mr President , I , too , would like to offer a warm welcome to the Moroccan delegation with us today . I shall also endeavour to analyse two issues confronting us , namely the Growth and Stability Pact and the informal ECOFIN Council and shall attempt to report on both during my first speech .
The inclusion of safety and territorial cohesion as priority objectives will doubtless improve the design of future transport policy and will contribute to making its practical application fit with the public &apos; s expectations , needs and possibilities .
I would also like to thank Mr Sterckx for his work .
As Mr Martin and many of my colleagues have said , and I am not going to repeat it , from a political point of view it is not acceptable that the budget set for the only regulation dedicated exclusively to the protection of forests , to pollution and to fires is being reduced by EUR 5 million , and to say that we are now going to combat fires , leaving out prevention , we are going to study pollution , increase biodiversity and also study carbon .
I feel that the European Union as a whole has displayed abundant prudence , caution and goodwill when handling transatlantic relations . Therefore , Mr President , I believe the time has come for the Commission to respond in kind now that we have the ability to suspend the negotiations until reason and good sense prevail .
Commissioner , in view of the expectations of the industry in question and the sensitivity of European public opinion , I would like to know what actions the Commission will take to ensure that that country respects WTO rules .
This is a purely economic concept .
There is a third aspect to be dealt with : better distribution of the civil and military use of the airspace of the fifteen countries .
In relation to my report , Baroness Ashton , I would particularly like you to take note of paragraph 6 , which calls for the drafting of a White Paper with a strategic focus on the European Union &apos; s role in international organisations through to 2020 .
The H@@ ä@@ us@@ ling report on the protein deficit in Europe and the search for solutions introduces some positive elements such as aid to farmers that contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions .
We will have to act so that justice is done and in order to prevent , through action or omission , more innocent victims .
Mr President , many thanks to Mr An@@ dri@@ a for his report on the amendment of the Regulation on the facility providing medium @-@ term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments .
This means that the Member States , through their governments and central banks , are fundamental to the whole process and also to the operation of providing information .
We must be aware that things are not easy , that it does not appear that the latest measures taken by the Lukashenko regime are going to improve the situation , but we must nevertheless have faith in the citizens of Belarus .
Finally , the almost religious respect for the Financial Perspective laid down in Berlin will prevent us from being able to cope with exceptional situations .
It is very important that we ensure as soon as possible that the European Union is an area in which researchers , technologies and knowledge can move freely , where there is effective coordination of research activities and where the best possible use is made of resources . This requires , amongst other things , that we have large research infrastructures at the European level .
My own view is that the Union &apos; s budget is on quite a different level from that of the Member States .
We must act in a firm and determined fashion in order to ensure that the statements and commitments repeated at so many ministerial conferences are turned into realities .
With regard to the issue of complaints , this falls to Mrs Wallström .
Now there is a new communication on tariffs and duties on energy .
One of our concerns with the German programme is clearly to insist that this di@@ p in the trend must be a one @-@ year exception arising from these tax cuts and must not affect future years .
That is no way to make progress .
I simply wish to point out that , as mentioned by Mr Fischer , the President of the Council , during the German Presidency - which has been a complicated and difficult Presidency - some of the great issues and challenges which were facing us have been resolved .
Now that the White Paper and the review of the trans @-@ European networks have been presented , I trust and hope , within the framework of codecision , that this Parliament will make its contributions , the added value of which is evident .
While the problems in the Mediterranean remain serious , and there has been considerable delay in implementing the Barcelona decisions that were designed to tackle them , we cannot accept a reduction in investment .
The gender perspective , specific policies , increasing awareness and support for the public and private capacities of the developing countries , so that they can take the initiative of promoting equality between men and women , are some of the measures essential to progress on this strategy .
There is also frustration , Mr President , at the insufficient role played by the European Union in this conflict .
Security , peace and stability in the area are good for everyone , and we in this Parliament must commit ourselves to strengthening and reinforcing that .
Perhaps it is time that we insisted that Member States resolve the demographic problem at source , through a suitable approach to both tax revenue policies and social expenditure , in order to protect families with children .
Mr President , I believe that the situation in Tunisia has caught the European Union on the hop .
Globalisation , European financial integration and market consolidation , which have affected the organisation and out@@ s@@ our@@ cing of operations to provide these services , have further added to the comple@@ xi@@ ties .
Sometimes it is better to take the path of incentives , other times it is better to take the path of sanctions .
Currently - at the last meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee - it has a majority position in favour of a deadline for the permanent removal of this aid in 2018 , which is longer than the Commission &apos; s proposal . Our rules state , however , that unless the Council decides unanimously , the Commission proposal cannot be legally modified .
I think that with what has been created and agreed so far , it is not going to be possible to achieve all of these ambitious objectives .
To sum up , we have believed in the project and we are supporting it .
I would like to focus on three points , which in my judgment are the hot@@ test , or potentially the hot@@ test issues .
The agricultural sector , which is also immersed in the crisis , deserves those funds to drive its own innovation . An innovative Europe can bring innovation to agriculture , so that it may build a future just the same as that of the other strategic sectors .
And consequently , what are the next steps we should take ?
It is true that the economy is less vulnerable than it was 25 years ago , but at the end of the day it is still vulnerable .
Yet the lev@@ elling @-@ out - if that is indeed our aim - has to be achieved through favourable treatment of those southern countries , giving them advantages , making their task easier .
I stand before you today as Secretary @-@ General of the Council , but I am also here in my capacity as the High Representative for the Union &apos; s Foreign and Security Policy .
Since 1994 , amongst the one hundred thousand personnel deployed as peace @-@ keeping forces , more than three hundred cases of sexual crimes against children , against people with few resources , have been investigated .
Yes , the Kurdish people .
What can the European loyalty and mutual solidarity we committed ourselves to in the Treaties mean to Mr Aznar ?
Although dra@@ con@@ ian measures have been adopted in the various Member States , we must recognise the risk that the disease will spread .
Mr R@@ ø@@ mer has surely only read the title of my question , which is the same , but has not read the text .
At the moment we are only talking about on @-@ board personnel .
What you have said would justify reconsidering the issue of economic governance .
This recognition was unanimously expressed to President Cox during his first appearance before the European Council .
It all depends on what we consider the objectives to be .
The Commission aims to replace agricultural research with action to support the development of specific initiatives encouraging tobacco producers to change to other crops and engage in alternative economic activities generating employment . De@@ duc@@ tions from the producers &apos; premiums are to be implemented progressively starting in 2004 .
N@@ ever .
It is still a little early to say what action we should take , although various options are on the table .
Given that the European Union is currently concluding the negotiation of an agreement with Mexico , I would be grateful if this Parliament would express its solidarity and sympathy for the victims of this earthquake .
It is true that you have made a series of comments , a series of specific proposals for new classi@@ fications , new data which I believe is essential we take into account in future reforms , in those changes which will unquestionably take place .
The Association Agreement , which was signed on 25 June 2001 in Luxembourg , and which has still not entered into force because some of the ratification instruments have yet to be put in place , establishes respect for human rights as one of its essential features .
The sky over the European Union today is an immense blue bon@@ d stret@@ ching from Las Palmas to Mal@@ mo , from R@@ ho@@ des to Dublin .
Concerning agriculture , we call on the Commission to make a statement on the pilot projects and on the initiatives launched in the 2004 budget .
Freedom of choice does not exist if consumers are not in a position to exercise it properly .
History will therefore demand an explanation from many as acces@@ s@@ ories to the crime , at the very least due to their failures .
In overall terms , the euro effect must be seen as a total , absolute success : we have managed to improve growth , improve the conditions for stability in our economy , we have managed to keep inflation down to a relatively low level despite the risks we are facing , and we are achieving the basic objective , which is to keep inflation under control .
The inspectors are the eyes and ears of the international community .
I think that the process of moving towards the rapprochement of Turkey and the European Union is possible ; it is a feasible process .
Secondly , we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO .
The most striking aspect of this report is , once again , the significant budgetary surplus for 2001 : 16 % .
Proble@@ ms still lie ahead on this road , however , such as the overly @-@ long transitional period laid down for the reform of the Financial Regulation . We are in a period that is bad for everyone , including those responsible for payments , in which we have an old system , a new system and an intermediate period in which there is a certain feeling of confusion .
Basque society rejects its crimes .
The Pittsburgh Summit agenda will also cover other issues : financing of climate change , in preparation for the Copenhagen Summit ; the need to resume international trade negotiations and not to give in to protectionist tendencies ; and increased support for the weakest and most vulnerable countries in tackling this crisis .
But it deserves to be taken into account when we speak of the other amending budgets .
You will find us helping the Galicians , you will find us helping the Spanish and saving these coasts . That is what we are working on .
Some time ago the Director of this Directorate @-@ General told me personally , and I am talking about more than ten years ago , that the Directorate did not need more money , but more staff .
This directive , however , and through no fault of the rapporteur , who has fought extremely bra@@ vely - and I thank you for that , Mrs Hieronymi - gives national regulatory authorities the power to decide what is accurate and what is not , what may be broadcast and what may not or , as has happened in Catalonia , one of the European regions with the poorest level of democracy in the whole of the European Union , which operators may broadcast and which may not .
I therefore believe that this work is only just beginning , as I said before .
The directive will be revised before 20@@ 17 .
Furthermore , the fishermen and companies must know that this assistance is available to them in order to provide them with the incentive to participate significantly in the recovery plans being considered .
We are talking in this case about a budget of balances , an enormous budget and surplus .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your detailed account of planned developments in the euro zone , but I had put a specific question to you . Are you aware that on 4 January , all the financial institutions in Spain simultaneously began to charge high com@@ missions on the purchase of currencies that are part of the euro ?
Firstly , we need a real commitment to ear@@ marking resources for the Strategic Energy Technology ( S@@ ET ) Plan .
De@@ termin@@ ed action has succeeded in preventing the worst .
Certain Members and groups have expressed their concern at the occurrences of leaks to the press - a concern which I share - and I think that we should ask the Court of Auditors , as well as the other institutions , to respect the time limits .
The aim of the annual fishing plans , the reduction in the fishing season , the strengthening of the monitoring system , the spa@@ wning grounds in the Mediterranean and the presence of ICCAT observers in the pur@@ se seine fishery and on tuna farms , all measures included in the regulation , is to ensure compliance with the management measures adopted and to ensure traceability at all stages . I think they will be successful .
Commissioner , I should like to know whether , under the measures you referred to , direct aid to farmers is already being provided or will soon be .
There is evidence that other governments and , in particular , Portugal , were ( in the context of a secret NATO agreement ) aware of the use of their airspace and airports for maintaining the detention , kidnapping and torture network mas@@ termin@@ ded by the US .
Nevertheless , on the subject of the framework concept , there is another issue which I would like to comment on .
I think that the reference to &apos; hidden &apos; advertising mechanisms that have developed on the Internet and are now in use there is appropriate ; in many cases the advertising is disguised as opinions or comments on social net@@ working sites , forums or b@@ log@@ s .
Parliament &apos; s reaction to the lesson learned must be unanimous : we cannot continue to approve budgets that meet the Commission &apos; s material demands , yet deny it the human resources needed to ensure that they are properly managed .
And Commissioner Fischler is one of the few people to have made the effort to go there .
We are implementing a series of measures to try to prevent the disappearance of European shipbuilders at a time when Korean shipbuilding and shipbuilding in certain other countries is growing as a result of the substantial state subsidies they receive , leading to entirely unfair competition .
From a general point of view , the Commission agrees with the analyses , questions and concerns set out by Mr Sainjon and , in general , by the European Parliament . And it is true to say that as far as this issue is concerned , we are at a crossroads .
the report by Mr Leinen , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on Parliament &apos; s new role and responsibilities in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon ,
I shall make some comments about the main amendments .
Madam President , I would like to make a final comment about the visit of President Bush .
It should also be pointed out that the time to provide a transport solution , or to compensate passengers , has now been reduced by a third with respect to the initial proposals : dro@@ pping from the initial 120 minutes to the 90 minutes that we have agreed in the texts .
I call on the Commission and on the Council Presidency to give the report serious consideration in their future work .
That is to say that I have the impression that , as Commissioner McCreevy has said , at this point , the only possibility is to bring an action before the British legal authorities , but not before the Institutions of the European Union .
However , after the first few years of implementation of the new instrument the results will have to be assessed and efforts made to encourage substantial increases in the contributions from the actors concerned .
I sincerely hope that condemning the Cuban regime in this way will not destroy the fragile framework for dialogue that is still alive between the European Union and Cuba .
I would like to know whether you think that it is not leading the European Union to have negotiations going on at this moment with this House on the financial supervision package .
We are just as concerned as the next person about the gener@@ alized climate of violence prevailing in Colombia .
Ladies and gentlemen , we believe ― quite rightly I believe ― that we must continue to help President Abu Mazen .
Both institutions can rely on the strong support of the Socialist Group in Parliament in relation to development aid policy .
Also , there are eleven central and eastern European countries at our door , and as things stand , their safeguards in that area are dubious , to say the least .
We can also be reasonably satisfied about the level of coordination that has existed between the various European representatives on the G20 : the European countries that are G20 members and participate in the G20 meetings as such , plus the Presidency of the European Union together with the Commission , the latter representing the voice of all Europeans and the common position of all Member States .
I would like to talk about the assessment in Laeken on the subject of the application of justice and home affairs policies .
However , it should be understood that education , health , etc. have a dimension that cannot be submitted purely and strictly to private enterprise .
If the location clause is removed suddenly , do we not run the risk of reducing manufacturers &apos; capacity to organise their distribution network ?
The question of democracy and human rights or authoritarianism is alive in the Mediterranean and will continue to be so in the coming years .
I do nevertheless feel that as the Treaty of Amsterdam takes precedence over our Rules of Procedure , it would be illogical for us to require an absolute majority for the draft and then adopt the final version by a simple majority .
It is estimated that currently more than 1 100 multinationals , which employ approximately 15 million people , would be affected by this Directive and by its modification .
But in the immediate after@@ math we must react determin@@ edly in order to defend our freedom and to do justice to the victims , showing the terrorists and their accomplices that their objectives have failed .
I personally believe that the creation of this Agency will demonstrate to the public our institutions &apos; great interest in preventing future accidents and pollution , as well the need to raise levels of safety on our seas .
I should just like to make one comment on electronic payment : the Commission has tried to ensure that for the purposes of the changeover to the euro , European banking feder@@ ations and associations move ahead with reducing charges for electronic payment . We have not , however , made any headway on this matter .
In many respects , we are already acting in line with the points that he made .
In Cambodia , as has been said , it is not just the attacks on democratic plurality - arbitrary persecu@@ tions and detentions of several leaders - that are alarming , but also , as Mrs Valenciano has pointed out , the doubly worrying situation of women and children in that country .
As for the treatment of asylum among the Member States , in Spain it was said that Aznar had already achieved everything : that kind of bra@@ gging is soon cut down to size when we see the proposals and the texts .
I should add that the mal@@ a@@ ise felt by the population was exacerbated by the former government &apos; s plan to rent one million hectares of land in the south of the country to a Korean firm .
Neither can we forget what the e @-@ Europe initiative means for new jobs , new technologies and the information society , where I think women have an important role to play .
In other words , those who have the money can buy the security the state is unable to guarantee .
When we talk here about waste management , it is as if we are talking about something vague and e@@ the@@ real .
Commissioner , I congratulate you on the presentation of this document which is the last of the raft of rules relating to vertical restrictions .
As on other occasions , such as the Intergovernmental Conference of 1996 , this Parliament must offer the Commission its support in order to monitor information activities .
Mr President , I would like to express my agreement with Mrs Kor@@ ho@@ la ; I really cannot agree with Amendments 22 , 23 and 25 .
All this cannot be achieved while reducing States &apos; contributions to the Community budget .
At the present time all the Member States of the European Community are party to the Madrid Protocol and are of course governed by the Rule of Community Law and they are not the only ones ; in addition many more countries who are hoping to join the European Union or who form part of the European economic area have also acce@@ ded to the Madrid Protocol .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there is no question that European industry is currently facing a process of globalisation of the economy that is making competition conditions increasingly tough .
It is indeed an appropriate moment to thank the rapporteur , Mr Bowis , for his work , and to wish him a speedy and happy recovery .
Firstly , Parliament must support its delegation in the Convention , which has achieved a good text , an intelligent text , although naturally it is not a perfect text , because no legal text is perfect .
It is a political problem ; and the problem that now arises in the case of the banana is none other than the weakness of the European Union against the United States . This weakness is caused by the defe@@ ati@@ st attitude of the Commission itself during negotiations in international fora , and its particular sensitivity to the approaches of the multinational companies .
Will it be extended ?
What happened in Haiti would probably not have happened if there had been a public education system and if children were looked after as they should have been .
This is the major challenge we must face if - as Mr Bontempi also pointed out - we want the European Union to change for the better and become a Union that represents guarantees and efficiency , citizenship and law@@ fulness .
Furthermore , as you know very well , Spain and France have set up a monitoring centre for traffic in the Pyrenees in order to seek the most suitable solution to the problem facing them .
So slight is the reform that it does not amend the total maximum guaranteed quantity , although it does split it into two , nor the amount of aid per hectare .
The European Union is responsible for taking the lead in the fight against such harmful forms of fishing and must be capable of putting forward its own alternatives .
We would have liked to achieve everything by now , but we must understand that sometimes we cannot achieve what everybody wants . We have , however , taken very significant steps forward which , I insist , have already had real consequences by improving safety on our seas .
This approach includes the review of the Lisbon Strategy , the reform of the Stability Pact , which we are going to discuss in this Parliament in a few days time , and also , I hope , as from the European Council in June , the new financial perspectives for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
I agree that we should establish comparable bases for the budgets so that we can make comparisons homogene@@ ous , but I would like us to bor@@ row an accounting technique from the private sector , a form of budget forecasting , in order to take account of the obligations of which we are aware .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Ayuso , for the great rigour and care with which she has produced this report .
I ask you to respect the historic peoples of Europe and the hundreds of millions of Europeans who consider themselves democratic and peaceful nationalists .
Cross @-@ border cooperation may not be sufficient to facilitate perfect collaboration with neighbouring countries . We can and must however take advantage of its benefits .
As you have just pointed out , Commissioner , as guardian of the Treaties , it falls to the Commission to carry out the task of control .
My group , Madam President , believes that this attitude is profoundly mistaken and that it in no way contributes to a recovery of the peace process .
All the others , either in their entirety or in part , can be accepted .
Ladies and gentlemen , as far as I am concerned , that is what the citizens are asking of those of us who represent them here and , first and foremost , Galicians , since they have suffered these consequences at their core to a greater extent than anyone .
As with the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company a few weeks ago , and the annex on participation , we have been making more progress in the last few months than we had for years .
By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant , and is therefore not a problem , from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity , stifling the chances of any economic and social development , we are perver@@ ting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon .
Thanks to this , the statement includes most of our suggestions .
Another action is the participation in world associations .
The first item is the report by Mr E@@ ppink , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary affairs , on the Report on Competition Policy 2009 .
These are two radically distinct matters .
Therefore the approved amendments proposed by the rapporteur on this matter enjoy our full approval .
I accept the two amendments presented by Mr Guer@@ reiro , as well as Amendment 17 , presented by Mrs Stihler .
But it is clear that a liberalisation process will only be efficient and not cause problems if it is carried out in a legal framework with adequate control as regards regulation .
I would like to know if my impres@@ sions are right . The current Presidency of the Council has attached too much to the problems over PHILOXENIA .
However , we believe that the most important issue is to highlight the fact that inland terminals are an integral part of the network , and it does not seem relevant to us whether they appear on a map or not .
For all these reasons , I regret , once again , to say that I have voted against .
Before , the motto of sport was that of Pierre de Cou@@ ber@@ tin , &apos; the important thing is taking part &apos; .
Mr President , I am sorry , but it is impossible to follow the vote at the speed at which you are reading the amendments .
Nevertheless , I believe that it contains sufficient positive elements to lay the foundations for a future CFP .
Parliament hopes that the Commission can present initiatives soon because the Commission &apos; s power of initiative is part of the framework for cooperation with the other institutions .
You have added Afghanistan and other priorities .
At present , we have 25 000 civil servants who adminis@@ ter a substantial budget on behalf of a Community of 15 countries and a population of 380 million people .
This was evident a few weeks ago when we had to confront the risk of collapse in the financial system . It is also evident now that we are having to face the prospect of a recession in most of our economies , and when we are , for the first time in our lives , even facing a risk of def@@ lation .
To end , Mr President , I want to make another call , this time specifically to the French Presidency , on a matter closely linked to this one : the creation of a European civil protection force , on which Michel Barnier , a former Commissioner as you all know , presented a report to the European Council in 2006 .
We should remember that many terrorist incidents have resulted from a lack of security within airport installations .
Of all the Union &apos; s external relationships , the transatlantic relationship is surely the closest one between the European Union and a third country .
My question was simply whether yesterday &apos; s vote was valid or not , and if it was not valid , what we were bas@@ ing ourselves on to invali@@ date what had already been debated and voted on .
In relation to this , the resolution to be voted on tomorrow is an attempt to reinforce the main objectives and intentions of the international conference , as follows : firstly , ensuring the best possible protection for fauna and flora resources ; secondly , encouraging sustainable use of land for the conservation of species and nature ; and finally , preserving our natural genetic capital .
It is a tax that pen@@ alises specula@@ tors and would force all those who have profi@@ ted by gambling with our money to pay up . It is a tax that would increase transparency and reduce financial speculation and , above all , a tax that would not affect citizens , because it would force those directly responsible for the crisis to pay for their excesses .
What , Mr Solana , should the content of the United Nations Resolution be if it is to take up this challenge and mitigate the threat to peace and international security posed by Iran &apos; s un@@ r@@ ani@@ um @-@ enrichment programme ?
It is a great country with which we want to have solid relations , with which we are involved in serious negotiations with two approaches , one of an economic nature and one of a political nature .
That is the experience that we had in 2009 : it was a year with very important repercussions for my country , Spain .
Sup@@ posing a Member State &apos; s legislation allowed family reunification based on common law relationships , who would be able to verify the existence of such a relationship , and how ?
When the Europe of the euro is born it is essential to have a European political union in which citizens can participate .
The problem is that the consequences of this will harm the effectiveness of development policy and , what is even more serious , those people who should be benefiting from it .
Personally , I should like at this point in time to be realistic and to try to work towards achieving specific and tangible results at this difficult juncture and I believe that this is what the European Union is doing .
Commissioner , is it true that it is manufactured in Austria , from there goes to Holland and from Holland is exported ?
It is only through respect and reciprocity that we can make progress in the task of promoting human rights .
It would indeed be ideal to create competition structures which include basic principles , such as restricting abusive practices and concentrations , common principles to prohibit unfair competition in the international sphere , and the development of a cooperation instrument based on experience gained in this field .
As you know , Commissioner , this is one of the Spanish Presidency &apos; s priorities , and we are now crossing the half @-@ way mark .
In view of this information , how can it be guaranteed that the 1 500 Brazilian farms do fulfil the agreed requirements ?
Therefore , they are submitted to online processing .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance supports the process opened up in Spain to finally put an end to the terrorism of ETA and find a solution to the Basque conflict .
Mr Barroso , the European Commission is rather more than the honest bro@@ ker you referred to in your speech yesterday , or the .
Of course , we also have to think about a tax like the Tobin Tax , which would affect currency speculation . Just a 0.5 % tax on this currency speculation would be enough to cancel the debts of all poor countries .
On behalf of my group , I regret that there has been no follow @-@ up to what happened in Jen@@ in and that the International Commission of the United Nations has not been allowed to investigate events ; if there has not really been a genocide , I believe that that investigation would even have helped Israel to present and justify its action .
Our thinking is based on the fact that workers who carry out their professional activity outside a working relationship with an employer or company are not generally protected by the Community directives relating to health and safety at work .
It is , moreover , a fact that social systems - protection systems - have been suffering from the influ@@ ences and consequences of economic , demographic and public health situations , etc . And it is also a fact that economic recession , unemployment , social exclusion , the appearance of new diseases , the ageing of the population , as well as advances in research , improved ther@@ a@@ pies , the development of new techniques of diagnosis and treatment have all had a profound effect on the levels of mandatory social and health cover .
Madam President , as a member of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party , I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer , Jorge Díez E@@ lor@@ za , and the Basque M@@ P and former vice @-@ president , Fernando Buesa .
As in previous years , the Court points out that , in 2003 , the Commission &apos; s accounting system was unable to guarantee that all of its assets had been correctly recorded .
Firstly , a major budget is essential to tackle the cyclical difficulties .
I would therefore like to thank you for making things absolutely clear .
As has been said by the scientists themselves , however , it seems absurd to have one per boat , because as well as emp@@ t@@ ying our o@@ ce@@ ano@@ graphy institutes , there would be no point in having one per boat , as it is much more important to consider planned and organised sampling programmes that are maintained over time , which is what is going to give us a good monitoring overview of these fisheries .
We are doing so with more reasons than we had then to be pleased with the results achieved , which were the fruit of the cooperation and consensus that exists in this House on such a sensitive issue for the public as safety on our seas .
Hence , given the undeniable role of monetary policy in terms of promoting investment and productivity on the inside and competitiveness on the outside , the report &quot; s resolution must place more emphasis on a close association between the European Central Bank and investment and growth policy .
The Palestinians know that if the Palestinian State were established today , they would not be in a position to operate as effectively as we would like and therefore we must give them the opportunity to prepare themselves adequately and to have the guarantee that the Palestinian State is a State that functions , that is viable and that defends the values which we all , and above all they all , or the majority of them , wish to be respected .
The Spanish Presidency must also make a clear commitment to developing a common European strategy . It must also review prevention measures and the forestry management models that encourage large fires .
We will vote , Madam President , in favour of Mr Leinen &apos; s report .
Why is it rejecting a gradual reduction of the European fleet over three years , while in private it authoris@@ es private Asian companies to use its fishing grounds ?
I would like to join the Commission - and now the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council - in asking , by way of extension to the previous question , whether the Spanish regularisation efforts are not tantamount to sta@@ king everything on legal , regulated immigration , on strengthening border controls and on combating the hidden economy , as so clearly stated by the President .
Mr President , I believe I have followed the Rules of Procedure .
I have insisted to the Lithu@@ anian authorities , and to the authorities of other States in a similar position , that they have the strategy before the date , because , without a strategy , the dates decided upon will have to be modified over time , since the decision on the date , in itself , is not sufficient to satisfy the criteria that are going to be required .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - Mr President , Mr Füle , the European Union has a very serious problem with its neighbourhood policy , which must be corrected .
My group has nevertheless tabled a number of amendments - Amendment No 125 and the subsequent amendments - most of which are technical . We trust that these amendments will therefore gain the necessary support within the House .
We are , of course , also relying on the work of Mr Ci@@ o@@ lo@@ ş for that , because neither our European producers nor our European consumers can go on being defenceless .
They say in the press today , in a study , that the aquifers which feed Doñana are at serious risk . We think the regional government of Andalusia has a responsibility , and the Spanish government .
Yesterday in this House , on behalf of my group - and I am pleased that the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council is here - we strongly supported the Belgian Presidency of the Council and the Council itself with regard to an issue which we feel is very important - I believe that President Verhofstadt is in Rome today - and that is that we manage to introduce , as fifteen countries , the anti @-@ terrorist legislation which this Parliament , the Council and the Commission have supported .
We were dealing with a matter relating to consolidation .
There are no magic recipes for finding absolutely effective solutions to such tragedies , but there are persistent and determined policies .
It is in no way a question of interfering with the European arms industry , which would not fall within our competence , but it is a question of setting the bases , the elemental principles , of a European arms policy .
The Commission communication on the future development of social protection , pursuant to the mandate granted by the Lisbon European Council , has provided us with the opportunity of doing so .
Either way it has been a long process .
Nevertheless , I do not intend today to deal with the aspects on which we agree - you know these from the communication - but I would like to expand a little more on the reasons for the two points of disagreement .
Seri@@ ous because it affects the operating costs of our undertakings , which are paying a very high price for the lack of a harmonised air traffic control system in Europe , and urgent because each time there is a disruption , not only does this involve losses for our undertakings , but also incalculable inconvenience for our citizens .
He was not allowed a proper defence at the trial .
I want to say that in that case the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly must be the legislative body that lends democratic legitimacy to this process .
I believe that this is due to precisely that idea of urgency .
In addition , within the scientific community there is a perception that the Directorate @-@ General appears to have opted to prioritise basic research without making room for research focused on public policies .
Furthermore , we need to find a formula to allow continued exempted access for traditional ACP producers with whom we maintain economic , commercial and political obligations which cannot be ignored .
I would urge you to continue investing in the protection of the environment .
Growth yes , growth with social cohesion , growth that will enable us to face the future in terms of technological challenge ; in the end , these are the Lisbon goals and these are the goals we have tried to include in our report .
These are good intentions , but perhaps they might not stand up to technical analysis , and I will be pleased to hear what Professor Monti has to say .
However , in the spirit of compromise we could accept Amendment No 27 .
If we continue along these lines efficiency and transparency should improve still further .
In 2001 , that figure has risen to 5@@ .4 % .
The first relates to the definition of the individual character of the design , which incorporates an element that supposedly brings it into line with the T@@ R@@ IP agreements .
We do not belong to ch@@ ari@@ table organisations .
The report of the support group of the OSCE for the early months of this year with regard to military operations carried out during this period spoke of civilian disappe@@ arances , loo@@ tings , the indiscriminate use of force and other violations of the human rights of civilians , all of this in contraven@@ tion of what had been previously agreed .
If such behaviour goes on here , in this very House , imagine what can happen in the wider world .
By means of a broad agreement , we shall approve new measures today that will represent progress in terms of equal opportunities for people with any kind of disability .
I should like the Council and the Commission to tell me how they plan to reform the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund and what they plan to do so that all the countries that should be are represented in the Financial Stability Fund .
Therefore , I urge members of the PPE Group to let us take this urgency session a little more seriously , or it will no doubt end up being completely pointless .
My group does not wish signature of the agreements to be conditional on resolution . Nonetheless , we wish to state in the strongest possible terms that this situation must be resolved immediately .
They involve many countries which also share the values of respect for human rights and democracy , and some of these countries are Islamic .
The figures given - 0.@@ 6 % of GDP and EUR 3 billion - do not correspond to what this situation demands , for this is no longer just an emergency but also a reconstruction effort .
However , the wider perception is , unfortunately , that the European Union has been almost absent from these processes in recent weeks .
I said that we have decided to support the investiture of the new Commission despite the reservations which we have in relation to Mrs de Palacio , whose innocence we accept , but whose idea of political responsibility in a matter which concerns the Community budget we do not share .
The proposal therefore constitutes a considerable step forward , given the objectives it pursues .
In that sense , I do not think a single regulation would be valid without taking account of how each Member State will decide to apply this Objective 2 , according to its internal organization .
We are speaking about an agreement which has not yet come into being .
I consider this to be the most decisive factor , and I would say that this is the weakest point at the moment .
Mr President , thank you very much to the Belgian President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council for his words on this subject .
As we know , the programme was established by means of the Council Decision of 17 December 2001 , which stated that assessment reports on the programme must be presented , accompanied by a proposal on its continuation or adaptation .
Mr President , this is a comment on the Minutes , too .
My country , Spain , is the country with the highest number of petitions studied at the Petitions Committee .
In the light of the introduction of these new measures and of the ongoing internal investigation of OLAF , it would have inappropriate to initiate an audit of Eurostat at this juncture
Not only for them , I believe , but at least , as a first step , for ships with potentially dangerous goods and for ferries , which transport people , and which also have problems .
The important thing is respect for the law .
The current system of mutual recognition means we are open to chains breaking at their weakest link .
Under the umbrella of the OSCE , the Union is preparing , by means of its rapid reaction mechanism , a range of measures for assisting in the elections and in legislative reforms in the electoral field .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is true that we are going to adopt measures aimed at a partial solution for the crisis in the dairy sector .
At the Council working group on human rights it was decided that there will be no common European Union position at the Conference . This is exactly the same approach as that adopted during the inaugural meeting held in War@@ saw .
With these figures the cost @-@ benefit calculations are not as attractive as we would wish , and this must be taken into account in the next revision of the emissions trading scheme if we want to send industry and consumers the right signals .
The Convention must take this into account when drawing up the Union &apos; s Treaty .
Firstly , the Egyptian people , who have seen their legitimate expectations of greater dignity and democracy satisfied , and , secondly , the international community that , not without a certain cynicism , has gone from being the ally of yesterday to the nuisance of today and , perhaps , to the accused of the future .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I join in congratulating all the rapporteurs .
Faced with these challenges , we cannot be miserly towards our citizens .
It is important to note , Mr Sterckx , that before the Prestige , there was the Erika , and in the same way there was no safe haven then to provide shelter for a vessel in difficulty .
The free movement of products meeting the requirements , the protection of the interests of consumers and the competitiveness of our economy are essential , however .
The Baltic energy market initiative now falls under the wider umbrella of the Union &apos; s Baltic Sea Strategy , which was one of the Swedish Presidency &apos; s main priorities .
It spe@@ lls out the political priorities for 2005 and the initiatives necessary for their implementation . It also outlines the budgetary guidelines needed to ensure the priority initiatives are adequately funded .
The negotiators of the de@@ posed President Zelaya did not establish , however , who should head the government of unity .
But , at the same time , this resolution shows the greatest respect for Chile &apos; s democratic and civilian authorities .
The outcome of the Las@@ hing @ Sea project has revealed serious deficiencies and negligence in the different areas concerned , such as lack of training and instruc@@ tion among loading personnel and ste@@ ve@@ dores in the ports and also among the ship crews , which are consistently under@@ trained and under@@ man@@ ned even though the ships they work on are genuine mon@@ sters of the seas .
In the case of Hungary and in light of these difficulties , at some point the Hungarian authorities contacted the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . Im@@ medi@@ ately after establishing contact with the IMF , they contacted the European Commission .
Now , certain people who voted in favour in the Committee on Petitions want to spoil this report irreversibly .
The Court , with its potentially universal scope , will require no less . It will certainly require more .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioners , today sees us beginning to mark out and trace the path we will be following in the early years of the next millennium .
And in relation to the fifth framework programme , I have to say that it is precisely those areas that have an impact on the dissemination of results that are scarcely accepted and considered from a budgetary point of view .
It means primarily documents drawn up by the Commission : some of these are interpretative , others are implementing acts , while others are merely preparatory documents .
I can tell you that , at this very moment , the Chinese and Russian representatives are in Te@@ h@@ ran , with a mandate from the five permanent members of the Security Council plus the European Union , to try to make the final effort to reach an agreement at the meeting that is going to take place on the 2@@ n@@ d , that is to say tomorrow .
The Commission has also presented us with data on over 200 pilot schemes developed , approved and financed .
It is very possible that the Greek authorities have made these estimates .
The difficulties we have had to face during recent months have basically stemmed from not having achieved a situation of budgetary balance or budgetary surplus during the previous improvement in our economic context .
I have taken good note of what she said and furthermore I would like to thank her publicly - because I raised the question at the previous plenary session - for the fact that Parliament has finally been incorporated into the statement of 7 March , something which did not happen initially , and that you have amended the letter that you sent us which had rather too much of a tone of the secretariat of the Council , including annexes .
Your support is absolutely essential and , in any event , we will keep this House fully informed of all the steps we take in relation to this project .
Mr President , a technical error has occurred . I intended to vote against Amendment 4@@ 44 .
The result could not have been more horrendous , Madam President .
I am convinced that the enlargement of the Union of 1 May , which will not be the last , is an elo@@ qu@@ ent example of this principle .
In fact , many fora and macro@@ conferences have already been held in relation to the need to increase efforts to eradicate poverty , which is undoubtedly the most serious problem we face .
This violence has cost the lives of more than 150 Palestinian children and adol@@ escen@@ ts and dozens of Israeli children .
Perhaps the message that goes out to the citizens tonight should stress the importance of this epidemic monitoring network because unfortunately there is a vacuum here and a need to fill it that we face today and every day .
Now is therefore the time to negotiate terms for the cessation of violence , demobili@@ sation and disarmament .
Mr President , I first want to express our most decided support for the report presented by Mr Izquierdo Collado , and especially for the implicit message contained in that report , which I think everybody has noticed , since the actual implementation of trans @-@ European hydrological networks represents an important way of contributing to economic and social cohesion .
In the agricultural field , we have not yet concluded a far @-@ reaching reform that will help us to maintain the competitiveness of our agriculture and allow us to improve the quality of life in rural areas . Nor will it be possible to complete such a reform as it does not address the fact that those who live in the countryside are still ran@@ ked as second class citizens .
There are even more disparities in level 3 , where a single Member State , Germany , has more units than eight Member States put together : France , Italy , the United Kingdom , Spain , the Netherlands , Denmark , Ireland and Luxembourg .
I believe that the forthcoming visit by President Bush offers a wonderful opportunity to restore that strategic alliance , that harmonious partnership between the European Union and the United States , and to ensure that the values we both advocate - including human rights and fundamental freedoms - can be taken on in all regions of the world , be consolidated and be truly effective .
With regard to the European elections , the issue is open , nobody has won them and I would like to ask my distinguished colleague , the chairman of the technical group of European conserv@@ atives , to explain to me what you have in common with the British Conserv@@ atives in relation to Europe .
The case of the Afghan women illustrates the problem of the lack of respect for human rights which takes place every day in all corners of the planet and also in this Europe of ours .
There have been improvements in the legal status of women , and advances in the labour market too , but there is still a vast imbalance in terms of power .
From the humanitarian point of view , geared towards the families and the suffering of people who have the right to recover the remains of the people they loved and who , as a result of the conflict , have no way of knowing , without the experts and the for@@ en@@ sic scientists of the Committee on Mis@@ sing Per@@ sons , either where they are or who they are , and they cannot be identified .
I also believe that this proposal is a necessary step , which requires others in order to make full sense .
It is not the first time in history that the law has faced a challenge .
We feel that there are other amendments that are not justified , not because we disagree with them in principle , but because they are not necessary : for example , Amendments Nos 4 and 5 , which refer to the distribution of the burden .
Madam President , the Council &apos; s reply has reassured me , and I am going to say something surprising : Frontex has worked .
This date will clearly be established as a political milestone in the history of our Union , overcoming Munich and Y@@ alta .
Commissioner Borg &quot; s announcement on the increase in de minimis aid does not sort the problem out either , since we will have to wait for nine months and for new Community rules in order for this to be resolved .
In my opinion , the Commission proposal , which aims to adjust the COM in bananas strictly to the WTO decisions , has to be criticized on a basic point : its unbalanced treatment of Community producers and operators , in neglecting to include alternative mechanisms to compensate them for the loss of category B licences . We have to remember that this mechanism was proposed by the Commission itself in order to guarantee the marketing of the Community banana and now , being one of the main points condemned by the WTO , it is not being replaced by anything else .
The global financial crisis does not au@@ gu@@ r a promising future for Doha .
It seems more like an academic meeting than a parliamentary sitting because we are discussing texts which are study texts and not legislative texts . A group of us , who already knew each other well because we are a group of friends from the Community fisheries sector , met in connection with these texts , which are in fact more academic than anything , and in circumstances which , according to the Commission reports , seem to be her@@ al@@ ding the disappearance of the sector .
I think it is particularly satisfactory that the priorities identified by the Commission , such as enlargement , stability and security , and a sustainable and socially inclusive economy , are very much in line with those that the Presidency itself and the European Union as a whole have defined and which have been confirmed by the European Council in Barcelona , about which the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the President of the Spanish Government , has just informed this House .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you are more aware than anyone of how my party wanted to help make the Spanish Presidency a success .
On the contrary , fundamentalism is reduced by promoting and exercising democratic freedoms , promoting the emanci@@ pation of women , pluralism and ideological and cultural diversity , the promotion of openness and the acceptance of differences and social and economic well @-@ being .
What use is it for the European Parliament to manifest its revulsion , as does the Committee of the Regions , as do the regional parliaments , as do the national parliaments of the Member States , and even town h@@ alls across the continent ?
It was disappointing , Commissioner , to hear your statement ; and it was very disappointing , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , to hear more empty words .
In fact , almost every day we witness events that take us back to the dar@@ k@@ est days of European history .
Lastly , Mr President , the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out . We have referred to the delay by the CE@@ N , the amendment of certain provisions , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific .
This is the only way in which we can head towards the fully employed society which is the only guarantee for European demography to be a favourable and positive perspective .
Another important issue for the EU is immigration control .
I believe this programming is an indication of the widespread recognition of the importance of the subject under discussion . In particular , it reflects the importance attributed to it by the House .
At@@ l@@ ético Madrid , its f@@ ans and even the Spanish police are being mis@@ treated by the Union of European Fo@@ ot@@ ball Associ@@ ations .
This is no easy task , however .
The solution reached by the European Parliament after almost two years of legislative work permitted and permits public authorities and public bodies to register as bodies with legal personality recognised Union @-@ wide .
Europe is charged with roo@@ ting out suffering in the world .
The labelling of toys is very important , common agricultural policy subsidies are very important , but even more important is the ability of lawyers - the people who manipu@@ late that instrument which in the final analysis is the grand instrument of integration - should feel involved , should feel European . Rec@@ alling once again the words of the Spanish king , Alfonso the W@@ ise : they become the true spokespeople of that European Law which we are all building .
It cannot be simply delivered on a pla@@ te , ready @-@ made .
I would like to end by saying that it is only natural that war@@ ships should be exempt from the provisions of the directive and , generally speaking , we support the proposal .
Using a single operator gives users access to gas infrastructures , since they will encounter similar contracts and codes , the same level of transparency and the chance to arrange services in groups .
We are therefore withdrawing our amendment from this paragraph .
It is a pity that this text presented by the Swedish Presidency does not offer any real progress in relation to the initial text of the French initiative .
I will try - I hope - to cooperate closely with the Commission in particular , with President Prodi and with Chris Patten , who is also here with us this morning .
Such action nevertheless , does comply with Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 on public access to the documents of the Community institutions .
For all these reasons and others mentioned by the rapporteur and some of the speakers , this report must be approved and , as a member of the European People &apos; s Party , that is what I hope will happen .
Thank you , Mr Vitorino , because I understand that the Commission intends to submit proposals .
This is an issue , Mr President , which is included in the European Union &apos; s Charter of Fundamental Rights , which states that linguistic diversity and all cultures will be defended .
It should be considered that emissions from transport could increase the most rapidly , potentially rising by up to 39 % by the year 2010 .
However , the question I wish to ask - and I shall conclude now , Mr President - is whether the EU Member States are willing to increase resources to meet the growing needs that are emerging in those countries .
I would like to remind you , ladies and gentlemen , that I committed myself to this before Parliament at the first reading of the legislative package , and that in January 2003 I gave the response I had committed myself to at that time .
The liberalisation of the aircraft maintenance service has not in any way undermined the security of aircraft .
The reform of the Community Customs Code was enshrined in Article 2@@ 53 of the current code and a reform was planned for before 1 January 1998 .
Logically , the first strategic objective must be to extend and stabilise the security zone around the European Union , in other words , around our continent , specifically to the east and the south .
A violence that you , Mr President , know well through having presided over the Parliamentary delegation which was in Euskadi and where it could verify that terrorist violence is not a local problem but a European problem .
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party and I think that at this stage we need to take a clear look at the situation .
Madam President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Az@@ zol@@ ini on his report , particularly as it deals with such a complex and complicated issue .
We are doing so and we are going to continue to do so , in order to try to ensure that this process , which will begin in June , and which was launched at the Bonn meeting , yields results .
Venezuela
Mr President , I would like you to make a public statement on behalf of this House , to express our support for the aspirations of the Basque people , and our sympathy for the family of José Luis Caso , who was murdered for having been democratically elected to represent Basques like himself .
Unfortunately , the discussion we are holding today in the European Parliament will have no impact on the final decision .
I prefer to take something from it that I feel to be very valuable : the fact that it has provided us with a great potential that we will be able to draw on in the coming months .
This resolution is also similar to those passed by the Basque Parliament and the Valencian Community , and to the support currently being given by the United States authorities to the Spanish judge , opening the archi@@ ves on cases which occurred during the dictatorship .
Are we really going to finance new commitments by cutting ones that we had previously made ?
I stand for the basic values that underpin our Union : freedom , respect for human rights , the rule of law , equality of opportunity , solidarity and social justice .
The year before the closure , it was able to fish 7 000 tonnes and each day it established and set the quota that could be fished in order to make that small quota more profitable . It then unilaterally decided to notify the Commission that it was stopping fishing because it had reached the limit set .
No , that is not true .
We have talked about this and we are working on it with a view to making a clear proposal in this regard in the future Prestige II or Erika IV package .
Who is responsible , in Question Time , for determining the order in which questions are answered ?
I am grateful for all the comments made in this regard but at the same time I would like to point out that in 1998 the then Austrian Chancellor , Vi@@ k@@ tor K@@ li@@ ma , commission@@ ed certain prime ministers , under the Austrian Presidency , to develop and present drafts of work to be carried out .
The ACP @-@ EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there .
This is something that we must never lose sight of and which must be taken into account in the framework of the current negotiations to conclude an association agreement .
I believe that this would have seriously inter@@ fered in the electoral process taking place in Israel .
Just this afternoon I was looking back over my speeches on Greenland in the plenary of Parliament , in 2003 and also in 2002 , and I believe that we are getting closer to what we were saying at that time and to what we have been saying since : that we want the Fisheries Agreement with Greenland to be as similar as possible to any other fisheries agreement signed by the Community .
Of course , Commissioner .
The US not only wants European markets to be open to products from the United States ; they must also be open in the way that the United States dictates .
Although I know that it is difficult to achieve this in the short term , given the interests that are involved , I would also like to say to Parliament - and I know that Parliament agrees with me - that this is a strictly necessary objective .
Mr President , Mr Morillon is to be congratulated for producing these reports in very difficult circumstances and with very little time . We are all in his debt and his reward has been the favourable vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
We must achieve - above all in the Mediterranean , and we Mediterrane@@ ans know this - something very important : things need to be explained .
And , in light of the magnificent report that has been produced , I also welcome the fact that it was drafted by our rapporteur , Mrs Langenhagen , whom I wish to congratulate once again on her work .
Furthermore , the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration stated in a press release on the publication of this study that the R@@ DA study was based on safe li@@ fe@@ time in@@ take . It went on to state that consequently there would be no harmful effects on the health of children aged between one and three who might temporarily exceed the R@@ DA .
We are therefore living - or at least we should be living - in a period of transition and of change , which you referred to . I would like to say , however , that the first challenge that we have ahead of us is to be able to find the turning point in the process of Europeans becoming distan@@ ced from European policy .
That is truly worrying in a country which , as has been pointed out , has been the victim of dictatorships , genoci@@ des , crimes against humanity , and - most seriously - the people responsible for them are still lor@@ ding it around the country and around the world unpunished .
I find it regrettable that there are still a few States even today who are limiting the rights of their nationals as European citizens .
That is what we propose and to this end we are going to prepare a supplementary report on the implementation of this directive , which we will present in 2002 .
I also wanted to ask you , in particular , whether making the European Union a genuinely attractive area for researchers is going to continue to be a priority .
Their great dynamism and capacity to grow and innovate have earned them a notable position in the EU &apos; s policies .
It is indeed vital for the European Union to give due consideration to the future role of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean area as regards peace , economic development , democracy , energy provision and economic investment . This report and the meeting to be held in Valencia to deal with these matters are therefore crucial .
I say this at a time when we are about to find out whether , on 2 November , the American super@@ power will opt for the path of constructive cooperation and respect for the opinions of others , including the international institutions , or whether it will choose the opposite direction .
In any event , I think this is an interesting report , and I shall be voting for it .
In order to fill these vac@@ an@@ cies , we will need to know the exact order in which the candidate countries will join the Union , and that is something that cannot happen now or in this budget .
In the euro zone , we have currently accepted the application of the analysis laid down in Article 4 of the Fund , which is produced each year with the International Monetary Fund .
Do not forget , Mr Aznar , to deal with the outstanding issues facing us in this six @-@ month period to come , during which enlargement and the euro are presenting the European Community with a very special kind of landscape , in which the whole world is more or less affected for various reasons which oblige us to make constant , permanent and joint efforts to achieve peace and prosperity .
Sel@@ f @-@ regulation is a contradiction in terms and is only appropriate where internal bodies regulate themselves . It should not be considered that a given sector can regulate itself through a system of self @-@ regulation and the same can be said for co@@ regulation .
( Parliament approved the proposal )
Finally , Minister , I would like to wish you the best of luck on the 10@@ th .
As was mentioned , the aim of this proposal on port reception facilities for ship @-@ generated waste and cargo residues from ships is to reduce pollution and thus protect the environment , in particular by monitoring the legal discharge of waste and other pollutants at sea . In this case , the Commission proposal was a necessary and desirable addition to existing legislation on the protection of the marine environment and the creation of fair conditions of competition between the ports of the Community .
This transfer of powers means de facto that Parliament and the Member States themselves are sidelined in the evaluation process , despite the fact that they are the ones with power over the security of their external borders .
What does the Presidency of the Union intend doing to guarantee that the 18 aforementioned judges , an integral component of this Court , designated at national level , meet with the requirements with regard to qualifications , balanced regional distribution , experience and parity between men and women ?
The people &apos; s awareness needs to demand the set of values required by the sustainable development model .
It is difficult to analyse what is happening in each Member State and , above all , know the facts and circumstances which affect each country in the light of our recent Charter of Fundamental Rights and , therefore , we must continue to study the procedure in depth .
Mr President , is it not acceptable that , in the case of Doñana , public money should be being used to re@@ generate the area , while the company that caused the major damage has only contributed a small proportion ?
I am sure that the citizens would support us in this ; the last Euro@@ barometer confirmed this : 71 % of Europeans want more emphasis and more resources to be dedicated to the information society .
There are still sectors such as air transport , energy and telecommunications in which , if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level , the cost supported by our companies is very high .
Neither the European Parliament nor the UCLAF are investigating authorities ; neither the European Parliament nor the UCLAF are public prosecution services .
Our position is more inclined towards giving greater competences to the Commission in this area .
Parti@@ cular emphasis should be placed on all of these issues because they have an influence on the awareness of society and on the way this horrendous phenomenon is reported .
Precisely for that reason we gave you that opportunity .
Unfortunately , Parliament &apos; s Committee on Fisheries knows very well what it feels like to beg for information from here and there amongst the negotiators , even in these times of transparency and cooperation which we have just inaugur@@ ated .
It may perhaps be worth considering that possibility .
We agree on that .
I wish to highlight just two aspects of this initiative at the moment : European Convention No 116 of the Council of Europe of 24 November 1983 on the compensation of victims of violent crimes .
Given the alarming statistics on the victims of this violence , we must carry out a genuine social revolution , since we cannot forget that , behind the statistics and the numbers , there lies the history of thousands of women who every day have to suffer at the hands of those who abuse them merely because they are women .
I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the Union &apos; s strong condemnation of the recent terrorist attacks , which cut short the lives of more than one hundred people and seriously injured many more .
This is another tragic example of the current threat to the universal values that we are all defending here today , despite the very significant progress that has been made in countries such as Liberia , Mexico , the Philippines and Moldova .
The Poos report has the merit of proposing to the Council some minimal reforms , which are likely to lead to a process of self @-@ reform which is becoming increasingly essential .
Mr President , I feel less optimistic than those who have spoken so far , because I believe that the document that has been produced is essentially a document full of statements , which includes many existing cli@@ ch@@ és , many arguments that we have all heard and which are leading to an increasingly weak and less respected notion of sustainable development .
We have all seen over recent months how , owing to several different circumstances , third @-@ country air companies have received large amounts of public subsidy which in many cases have been used to lower fa@@ res and create unfair competition on routes on which European Union air companies compete .
It is the Council that creates difficulties .
In our statement last Wednesday , the members of the Quartet called upon Israel to show restraint .
Europe owes Galicia a debt .
And I should like to remind you ...
( The President cut off the speaker )
There are various problems that China is not dealing with responsibly , given its role in the world , which is becoming increasingly interdependent : trade union freedom , freedom of expression , press freedom and also religious freedom .
This information is misleading , particularly at a time when Parliament is making a substantial effort to proceed with the emergency procedure on anti @-@ terrorist legislation , and I think it was a serious mistake , because it has led to confusion that has had a negative effect on everyone concerned .
The chapter on Justice in Civil and Criminal Mat@@ ters , in particular , has increased by 4.@@ 7 % .
What is happening in North Africa is proof of &apos; For@@ tress Europe &apos; .
The last issue I would like to deal with is the debate on globalisation .
We cannot be so on an à la carte basis .
At that time I only came across one fundamental exception : the President himself , Carlos Mesa , whom I found to be a man with good intentions , who is trying to find solutions by means of dialogue and negotiation .
So the problem that needs to be solved is ensuring that Community rules are effectively applied and , in my view , that is a great challenge .
Please restrict yourself to speaking as a question@@ er .
We are currently working on the round of forecasts for 2002 and I can point out that , according to those forecasts , growth has been gaining momentum throughout this year and we believe it will come close to potential growth and may even exceed it by the end of the year .
It is only right therefore that we congratulate the members of the Committee on Agriculture , those who coordinated the work , and especially Mr Daul , the Chairman and author of this proposal .
We now have an obligation to ensure that the Union &apos; s money is spent and managed properly .
We also propose extending this initiative to existing infrastructure , and we give our full support to the Commission &apos; s proposal for exemption from VAT , which we think is the key element of this initiative .
In other words , are we going to insist on multilateralism , or do you think that the Lisbon Summit will force us to continue further along the road of bilateral agreements with different countries , for example , in the continent of Africa ?
We are absolutely delighted that the majority of Israelis and their government appear to have abandoned the idea of a &apos; Greater Israel &quot; , but we regret that that project may possibly be replaced with that of a &apos; Greater Jerusalem &quot; spreading relentlessly over Palestinian territory . So far , 16@@ 4 k@@ m2 of the West Bank have been appropri@@ ated , to the north , the east and the south of the city of Jerusalem .
I would therefore be grateful if the Hungarian Presidency kept up these efforts toward continued progress , whilst recognising that the Council gives advice or makes recommendations on the discharge procedure , but it is Parliament - the European Union &apos; s only democratic institution , directly elected by the European public - that decides and adopts the final decision .
We must be conscious of the fact that , if this development is to be harmonious , we must insist on the idea of &apos; justice &apos; , we must promote the European judicial network , we must be capable of making sentences effective and making the sentences immediate , both the criminal and the non @-@ criminal ones , and we must facilitate direct relationships between judges .
Similarly , in January , Mr Aznar literally demonstrated his intention to create an area of greater economic prosperity to safeguard the European social model , but the Barcelona Council and the policies his government intends to apply in Spain show evidence to the contrary .
Specifically I support Amendments Nos 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 and 32 and I trust that the majority of this House will approve them and that the Commission will accept them .
Commissioner , the stability and growth pact provides for fines of up to the impressive amount of 0.5 % of GDP .
I believe that we must begin by acknowledging the generosity of the Commissioner &quot; s words , since there is no legal obligation .
It is clear that , in fundamental fraud , there are discrepancies between what the Court of Auditors says and what OLAF says .
This lies at the heart of all the trou@@ bles and tensions we are likely to experience in the coming months . What is more , we are , of course , completely over@@ looking the fact that , in light of the principles evo@@ ked by Member States regarding European integration , there is also the principle of precise budgetary control to be taken into account .
We would therefore be faced with a clear case of discrimination and hindering of the free movement of persons .
Nonetheless , it has succeeded in giving a new direction to some of these dynamics .
Furthermore , we believe that culture promotes wealth .
I would also like to express my horror at the fact that for some days we have seen the United States &apos; Government blatantly and ob@@ scen@@ ely distributing the boo@@ ty in the form of profits from reconstruction .
If we want to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and the Barcelona Summit and to reflect the recommendations made in the Kok Report , the Seventh Framework Programme must include a clear and proportionate increase in resources within the scope of the new financial perspectives .
For the vast majority , this support does not off@@ set the increased burden , and farms are being abandoned at an alarming rate .
Next month we will be discussing the Working Time Directive , which may also prove to be a worrying factor in terms of reconciling women &apos; s family and working lives . This is unquestionably a very sensitive issue in relation to work .
I am grateful to the Commissioner for saying that these programmes can be cofinanced by any public body . I am repeating it again now , because cofinance is not the sole right of the central government .
Yesterday , both Chris Patten and I were with the Pakistani Foreign Affairs Minister .
The debate will resume when appropriate according to the agenda .
The Committee on Petitions and I , myself , know that what often happens is that Member States either do not respond in time or , as we say in Spain , and I do not know if there is a good translation , they &quot; make the par@@ tri@@ dge di@@ z@@ zy &quot; &#91; try to deceive one &#93; .
However , I must again congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Gallagher .
Firstly , we live in a frontier territory where everything that has been done so far casts both light and shadow .
I am telling you that that is my intention .
Do not worry com@@ ra@@ des .
Mr Aznar , please do not let the neutrality of the Presidency paralyse our legitimate Europeanist objective of cohesion .
The Commission has opted for this second possibility ; hence , in our annual assessment , we shall now also review other aspects previously not considered in the past : first , the orientation of budget policy in each of the Member States according to the point in the cycle at which it finds itself , that is , whether these kinds of budgetary measures are pro@@ cyclic or antic@@ y@@ cli@@ c in nature and to what extent they help the market situation or create tensions within it .
Four extremely serious accidents of this kind have recently taken place along the stretch of Galician coastline known as the &apos; Coast of De@@ ath &apos; , which is a privileged area .
Finally , Mr President , although my report covers other things , I believe that we could achieve a positive DAS over the coming years , which is necessary for the Community institutions and , in particular , crucial for public opinion , which wants to see reliability , transparency and control right down to the last euro of the public funds managed both by the Commission and by the Member States .
And we are going to talk about where there will be a new form of supervision different from the Lisbon Strategy .
When the Commissioner appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Control , he blamed Parliament for blocking the MED programmes .
Lastly , the remaining ones serve to protect the legitimate interests of consumers and user companies .
If the codecision procedure is ever justified , I think it is in the case of this package and the way it has been handled .
In this respect , I would like to thank you , on behalf of all the Commissioners , for the input provided systematically in the debates and discussions which have taken place in the various committees in order to fine @-@ tune our programme .
Finally , Mr President , I think that it is of the utmost importance that the Commission , which has been working very well on this aspect , should have a sufficient margin of flexibility and should not be limited by a budgetary stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket that prevents it from carrying out this excellent mission .
I do not know how many of these 700 000 entered through France .
Today we are facing perhaps the first threat situated far from our border and we consequently need to deploy our capacities beyond our borders .
We also welcome these two Commission initiatives and I would like to ask the Commissioner a question : how have these proposals and initiatives been received by the candidate countries ?
For years we have been advocating the need for the outlying regions to have their shortages and natural disadvantages recognized so that they can become part of the internal market and benefit from their participation in it .
Mr President , I would like to offer a few explanations .
In fact , Prime Minister Aznar currently wants to become the chief of police and would also like to achieve a Europe of States which stands in opposition to the Commission and Parliament .
Greater integration of women into decision @-@ making bodies would undoubtedly facilitate this task .
The same applies to section 6 of last year &apos; s resolution , which clearly expresses our feelings on the matter and demands that the Egyptian authorities free those persons who were then imprisoned .
I believe that this Parliament , which has very clearly stated that it is opposed to the death penalty in general and , in particular , to the death sentences of certain prisoners in Equatorial Guinea , should take action , at least through the Presidency of the Council .
I propose that we accept it .
We are therefore only presenting one amendment , which proposes that , in accordance with the Treaty , the Member States should retain competences and be able to regulate this type of issue and even go further .
The Council &apos; s proposal has a bearing on the second part of the mandate given to the Schengen E@@ valuation Working Group , which is to confirm that the acquis communautaire is being correctly applied following the lifting of internal border controls .
This book was approved by 90 % of the Spanish electorate and by the majority of the national parliaments of the countries to which we MEPs belong .
These amendments were not adopted and the report ended up being nothing more than a list of sanctions on those countries that do not adhere to their budget .
The Commission has called for a mandate from the 15 Member States to allow it to negotiate replacement of the current system of variable import duties with fixed duties , within the World Trade Organisation . There does not appear to be agreement , however .
Nor do we believe that the Stability Pact will be good medicine ; we fear its consequences for European society .
The shipowners are obliged , furthermore , to employ a significant number of Mal@@ ag@@ asy seamen , which is rising from 6 to 40 , as has also been pointed out .
But having examined the case , I have no choice but to agree with what Mr Patten just said .
We want to provide the fisheries sector with guarantees of legal certainty , that what has been agreed will be fully implemented and that this agreement is viable .
This measure promotes aggressive behaviour amongst animals , as well as injuries due to the greater mobility of the cattle within the compar@@ tments of lorries .
This has not only perme@@ ated the guerrilla movement , whose finance increasingly comes from charges imposed on coca lea@@ f , but it has also extended the circle of violence to other armed groups and organised criminal groups .
Instead , we believe that the European Union &quot; s support and financial aid should be aimed at promoting free and open software in those countries , which require interopera@@ tive systems , as indicated in Mrs Trautmann &apos; s excellent report .
Therefore , the Presidency believes that the Barcelona European Council will guide Ecofin on the main issues to be included in the broad guidelines of economic policy and these proposals will be included in the Ke@@ y Issues Paper which the Presidency will communicate to the Barcelona Council .
Within all the groups . Mr President , there are differing sensitivities in relation to European integration , and this is all the more obvious when it comes to funding issues .
Further strategic reforms concern the review of the guidelines on the TE@@ N@@ s and the action plan on environmental technology .
The Commission does not plan to create a single charter of rights for people living near airports .
The document presents the macroeconomic conditions needed to promote durable growth , drawing certain conclusions from the slow growth recorded in the past , especially since the middle of the 197@@ 0s .
This comes as no surprise , Mr Galeote , when Mr Aznar supports the idea that we need to reduce State public services to a minimum .
Now , we cannot hide our profound differences at the moment , which relate not only to the value of international commitments at world level , but to combating such an important factor as climate change .
Mr President , once again human beings - although it seems unreasonable to call them this - have taken away the life of another human being , as part of their fight against democracy for all .
These are not , however , the only issues that should be considered .
Whereas , in 1995 , it accoun@@ ted for 5@@ .3 % of all spending under the EAGGF guarantee , in 1999 it was down to 3.@@ 6 % .
We do not agree with the recognition of Kosovo - we do not believe in the recognition of any state that uses force outside of international law - because we believe in international law , and we therefore believe that the decolonisation process of the Western Sahara should be in this report . We do , of course , also ask for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan , which as NATO itself acknowledges week after week , is causing innocent civilian deaths .
Public intervention purcha@@ ses were done away with in the 1998 reform , against Parliament &apos; s wishes .
That is the message that we must send .
As we all know , according to the official statistics there are 18 million unemployed - something over 10 % of the active population .
When the scientists presented it with the results of the study , which clearly showed that nic@@ o@@ tine is addic@@ tive , the company destroyed the study and dismantled the labor@@ atory .
All of this means that we have a text which enjoys broad consensus , and not only amongst the two main Groups , since this consensus has been for@@ ged through constant communication with social operators , entrepreneurs and workers , via the trade unions .
If the United Kingdom wants to do it and we already have a recommendation , let them comply with it .
Conclu@@ sion : these entities must be subject to the same conditions and requirements as bodies which play identical roles in other countries and which do have legal personality .
In this matter , we simply have to remember , for example , that in 1997 , within the European Union , more than 200 million people crossed the borders of their State of residence into the territory of other Member States .
Once again , I would like to congratulate you all and thank you for your work , and hope that this experience , which we are beginning with this debate today , will benefit the functioning of the institutions , Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
Mr Bor@@ lo@@ o will speak after the political groups , and Mr Bor@@ lo@@ o will speak again at the end of the debate .
The Council said so in Tampere 11 years ago , the Commission said so five years ago in its Green Paper , and tomorrow , Parliament must vote on a proposal for a legislative initiative .
The final prescri@@ ption - which is needed to vaccina@@ te the patient and ensure that this does not happen again or in any other way - is that we must continue with market integration .
The military objective slow@@ ed down somewhat during the Swedish Presidency , although that Presidency did make good use of its time to develop civil crisis procedures and management bodies .
The factors that have contributed to this positive picture include external factors , such as the sustained strength of the global economy , but also internal factors , which contradict the image of stagnation and paralysis that has been used to portra@@ y European economies , and in particular the economy of the euro zone .
We must once again demand that indicators be produced on the structures for childcare , dependent persons and family assistance , as well as the differences in salary between men and women .
The first relates to a report which I had the honour of producing at the request of the Council with a view to studying whether , before the end of the whole process of reforming the European Union - in particular institutional reforms - the Council could operate more efficiently , naturally within the existing legal framework and in accordance with what the Convention and , later on , the Intergovernmental Conference , may decide .
This will enable us to create skilled jobs .
This is why , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I ask for your support for our report .
Nevertheless , the Regulation did not cover these fishermen because it linked the fate of the vessel to that of the fishermen , preventing them from receiving the global premium for their conversion .
Furthermore , in accordance with the debate &apos; s agenda , the normal course of action would be for the joint debate on the four reports to take place and then for the Commission &apos; s statement to be made and a further debate on this to take place .
And we have to work on ensuring that the euro is a success on this basis .
On the one hand , the need to strengthen administrative capacity in the implementation phase of the new cohesion policy , through the setting up of a network of accredi@@ ted tra@@ iners in order to implement all training measures and , in particular , to implement them at all levels , especially at local level , where I believe most work needs to be done .
It is also important that the work of the CARDS management committee and the work of the Kosovo Reconstruction Agency should not get mixed up , or be dupli@@ cated or overlap ; instead there should be a perfect division of duties .
These problems must be highlighted , and they need to be approached globally . This work , of course , was done in cooperation with the Council of Europe , and a well @-@ deserved reference is made to this great institution .
In Galicia , specifically , you know that 1@@ 20@@ ,000 jobs rely directly or indirectly on fishing and that the agreement with Morocco especially affects three very significant areas : Ri@@ be@@ ira , O Mor@@ razo and A Guar@@ da , where there are approximately 150 ships and 1,@@ 500 sailors who depend on the signing of the agreement with Morocco .
Since I entirely agree with its proposals , I shall not reiterate its content now .
We fully accept a process which contains of good number of progressive perspectives .
With regard to possible risks to future growth , there were differences of emphasis , especially when some of the participants pointed out the risk that further external impacts may affect the Union &apos; s economy .
I voted against the report on a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Ta@@ j@@ ikis@@ tan because the EU is only interested in that country for its natural resources and its geo@@ strategic position , given that Ta@@ j@@ ikis@@ tan has borders with Afghanistan and China .
In any case , I would ask you to answer my supplementary question , as it comes from the tobacco growers of Granada themselves , who are concerned because it is rum@@ oured there that the accession of Poland and trade with Zimbabwe will be detrimental to them .
What would be the point of having more than 40 000 officials in more than 1 500 diplomatic missions between the Commission and the Member States - twice the number the United States has - if our activity really is not sufficiently efficient , coherent or visible ?
Mr President , I thank the rapporteur for his clarification , which I had also indicated in my speech .
All this will contribute to achieving the essential objective of greater cohesion by reducing the disparities that still exist despite the undeniable advances in the socio @-@ economic development of the regions .
For this there was a proposal and it seems that we have adopted it and this is the solid position we have taken .
As Mr Méndez de Vigo said , the Commission has acted quickly and the Council needs to do the same .
As you know , this year , the activity of the Committee on Petitions was marked by the change from the sixth to the seventh parliamentary term , which has meant significant alter@@ ations to the composition of the committee , since two thirds of its members are involved for the first time .
Their position is virtually the same as that of workers organised through their copyright societies .
Madam President , on behalf of my group , I should like to say that perhaps there is no real need to be as pessimistic as some of our colleagues have been .
One , according to the text , in Santa Cruz de Tenerife , and the other in Las Palmas , Gran Canaria .
70 000 ships pass through these areas , many of them large oil tankers , real mon@@ sters , of 100 000 , 200 000 or more tonnes , and at any time an accident involving one of these oil tankers could lead to the economic ruin of many of these islands which are dedicated exclusively to tourism .
Furthermore , this would represent a considerable reduction in costs .
The fundamental flaws that have encu@@ m@@ bered the CFP since the beginning have to be paid for by the industry at the end of every year with a series of increasingly brutal cuts to its operations .
At any rate , we are urging the Luxembourg presidency to set clear objectives and to establish mechanisms in this respect . It will also receive a visit from our Group in Luxembourg so that we can submit our own proposals .
It has done this , on the other one hand , by transforming the unfortunate and aggressive initial draft and , on the other , by taking on board that the agreements of the Third ASEM Conference in Se@@ ou@@ l have replaced the initial proposals contained in the European Commission &apos; s original document .
We must hold a world conference against terrorism under the auspices of the UN , where the different measures can be explained : cooperation amongst police forces ; structural problems : poverty , debt , inequality ; the role of the financial institutions and also of the different commercial bodies ; combating tax havens and money @-@ laundering .
In addition , it would be necessary to redefine the balance between coastal and industrial fleets . This would call for a system of compensation .
In this area , the institutions of the European Union - including the Commission of course - have a generic responsibility , because this is a question of spreading and promoting essential values which , furthermore , are the same as those which underpin our European project .
Many of our Member States have , as we know , extremely close historic , political , human , cultural and economic links with them .
This can and should be avoided .
In a free regime , such detentions would not have occurred .
You need to examine the possible solutions and this is why I think the E@@ TA@@ P programme is so important .
Mr Santer is here today and I would like to express my own personal gratitude to him .
As you are all aware , on 1 May the Commission forwarded to Parliament and the Council a communication detailing the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty for all proposals already submitted and not yet adopted .
I believe that it is necessary to repeat here some of the things that we said at that stage to the Council .
However , I believe that it would be misleading to say that nothing has happened throughout the whole of last year .
I am not asking for details or specific points , but I believe that a mention was required .
Because we are convinced , from experience , that the appropriations could not be implemented next year in the way the Commission proposes .
There were none .
Another true fact is that the European Union has maintained a common position since 1996 which has produced no positive result whatsoever and which has made no contribution to improving the situation on the island .
The Union &apos; s visibility has been in no way comparable .
Economic interests deserve to be protected .
We agree with your aims , Commissioner , but start work so that in the coming months we can have some elements that will enable us to know where we are heading with your ideas on the reform of the common agricultural policy .
Mr President , I have listened carefully to the speeches by all the groups and Members on this topic .
Lastly , it is true that the President of the euro@@ group represents the euro zone in the Monetary and Financial Committee of the Fund , in the former interim committee .
We need to have more and better coordination with Europol . We need to manage I@@ con@@ ex and , Mr President , in terms of safeguarding human rights , we need to have more and better coordination between Frontex and the International Organisation for Migra@@ tion and also the UNHCR .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , it is important to move on from words to actions and leave behind purely rhetorical statements , because you have signed a document reducing the European Union &quot; s ambitions and budgetary resources .
There are other examples , and they should not be repeated .
This is the desire of many people in Europe .
This was taken into consideration in the resolution by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure . The committee voted unanimously for immunity to be wai@@ ved , not because Mr Moniz wished to appear before the judicial authorities , but because all the necessary conditions had been met .
The opinions of owners and incentives for owners are also important issues , and so I have two questions for the Commission .
Therefore , I am not going to do anything .
Even if it had it , we would have to raise the question of whether the idea of monitoring the European Investment Bank is consistent .
Although it acknowledged that the airlines needed flexibility in order to manage capacity , the European Community adopted in 1991 - on the eve of the adoption of final legislation on liberalisation - a Regulation on denied boarding due to overbooking which guarantees the passengers affected financial compensation and assistance , but which is extremely limited .
For the moment we have a series of measures and a White Paper .
We must be aware that when a child needs help , that help must be urgently provided , without the effective resolution of each and every one of his or her problems being held up by red tape .
Mr Lamberts , Mr Hans @-@ Peter Martin has used his blue card to signal that he wishes to ask you a question .
What this current crisis has very clearly shown is the need to develop European coordination and interoperability further .
There is confusion in certain documents accompanying the draft resolution between data relating to the quarterly financial accounts and the data that is notified twice a year by the countries under the excessive deficit procedure , data relating to deficit and to debt .
I believe this suggestion makes sense .
I would also like to stress that the Turkish authorities &apos; willingness to tackle cases of violence against women and to accept the use of positive action measures with a view to combating gender inequalities is particularly significant .
He had been sent by the Basque Government to defend the Basque Country in Madrid . His only crime was that he was a socialist and a democrat and nothing more .
The conservation measures must therefore affect everybody .
Mr President , Mr Ar@@ vi@@ d@@ sson , I fully appreciate the work which you have done on this report .
Legisla@@ tion is important as well as eco@@ logically friendly agriculture , but it is not enough .
Many years ago , I learned from Milan K@@ un@@ dera and others that the Czech Republic was an important part of Europe ; you have demonstrated that and I thank you for it .
My group fully supports the rapporteur with regard to the main objective , which is , quite rightly , to provide the institutions with the necessary means for a good preparation for enlargement to 25 countries , which is just around the corner .
Hundreds of human beings have died this tragic death .
If it choo@@ ses the second approach , it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom , security and justice is built .
It is important to emphasise the fact that Prague has accepted the principles on which the common foreign and security policy is based . In fact , it was the Czech Government that took the initiative of strengthening political cooperation between all the applicant countries .
However , beyond these immediate challenges lie the future horizon@@ s of the Union , and the horizon@@ s of the Union depend on our ability to compete .
I am genuinely surprised by today &apos; s debate , because it appears that we are pit@@ ting the social Europe of the nineteenth century against a form of capitalism and the Ma@@ fia activities of the Chicago of the 19@@ 20@@ s in our ports .
We are therefore somewhat behind schedule .
I think the debate we had on SWIFT may clarify matters .
With regard to the outstanding commitments for the restructuring of the Moroccan fleet , we would ask the House for them to be included in the budget , in accordance with the approved Resolution .
There may even be some Member States that actually feel quite happy and say to themselves , &apos; my money is getting to the farmers , although I am not confor@@ ming precisely to the requirements that the Court of Auditors is demanding of me &quot; .
I would refer Members to those reports , with which they will be familiar .
In each case the fight is against a particular organisation that has a particular political agenda and specific political objectives .
I do not agree , because some of the Central and Eastern European countries that are not yet in the euro are in extraordinarily difficult economic situations , but there are others whose economic situations are no more difficult than those of more mature , more advanced economies . The latter have belonged to the European Union for much longer , have been receiving finance from the European Investment Bank and the Structural Funds for much longer and are in the euro area , and they have equally serious or sometimes more serious problems than many of the economies of Central and Eastern Europe .
Also , in connection with another undertaking made under the terms of the Rio Agenda - 0.7 % for Third World countries - the US is currently chann@@ elling only 0.1 % of its GDP towards development cooperation .
I know that we have a debate on the situation in Palestine this afternoon , but the truth is that , at this very moment , innocent civilians are still dying in Lebanon .
We are concerned not only about the traditional bre@@ eds , which are certainly in danger , but also this stock@@ breeding profession itself , which is also in danger .
Account must also be taken of the importance of these actions in the candidate countries , which will become Members of the EU in just over a year and which have administrative and economic restructuring difficulties that particularly affect women .
Latin America and the European Union need each other , and on the basis of an equal footing and with commitment to a climate of cooperation , they need to reinforce the instruments of political and trade cooperation .
It is therefore vital that they call for the immediate release of those detained .
Finally , Mr President , there have been five amendments to the report .
Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions : 177 in 2006 . Furthermore , it has broken the moratorium on st@@ on@@ ings and it currently has six women sentenced to death by stoning .
But although we cannot go into a schem@@ atic analysis here , I must make a comment in this context : the Common Agricultural Policy and the World Trade Organisation are increasingly promoting the search for aggressive competitiveness as a fundamental principle , which worries me greatly because this type of official approval of competitiveness , above all else , will surely lead to practices presenting risks , such as the use of hormon@@ es or antibiotics for example , amongst the raw materials used in animal feedingstuffs .
A Spanish business academic - Professor Garri@@ gues - explained very graph@@ ically that the American soldiers who came to Europe to fight in the Second World War brought &apos; anti@@ trust &apos; legislation in their ru@@ ck@@ sac@@ ks .
There should at least have been an indication of an intention to produce a diversi@@ fied policy .
One of these quantified objectives - and we will see if they are adopted on 25 and 26 March at the European Council , which has to examine the Communication from the Commission - is a 25 % reduction in the number of people who are at risk of entering poverty .
The European Parliament is preparing its position on the basis of the report drawn up by Mr Men@@ en@@ dez del Valle .
For these reasons , we consider that the definition of maladministration contained in our amendment , tabled by my group , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , is more detailed and concise and would be a much more appropriate basis for active , effective intervention , as well as being much easier for institutions and citizens to understand .
It is that when I read page 12 of the Spanish version of the preliminary draft supplementary and amending budget no . 4 / 99 , I realise that we are only dealing with the tip of the iceberg .
There is humanitarian aid ; there is a presence , but it is only relative .
Ladies and gentlemen , reference has been made to Eurocontrol .
The agreement was signed on 4 November in Stockholm and ratified by the Croatian Parliament on 20 November .
I genuinely do not know whether or not you , as rapporteur , have given this criterion of value for money , which I find so difficult to understand , sufficient thought .
Madam President , first of all , I must express my appreciation , on behalf of my group , for the tribute which has been paid to the memory of Mr K@@ r@@ ani@@ dio@@ tis .
I say this because , despite the increasing convergence taking place on each side of the Atlantic , substantial differences remain between the two markets , which have been identified both in the model of the stock market and in the actual structure of the market and in the elements of post @-@ negotiation .
As regards consistency across different Community policies , the current review of governance has already yielded a number of possible courses of action that the Commission will be sure to take into account when preparing future policies .
S@@ hor@@ tly after that pronouncement some frigh@@ tening statistics were published ; every 24 hours , 35 000 human beings died of hunger in the world .
The openness of Cuban society is at stake here .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say that I agree with what Mr Jarzembowski said in relation to urgency .
Mr President , the Mediterranean is a priority area for the European Union .
They also take into account the fact that single @-@ parent families could be the result of personal choice and in the same way need a strong support structure .
That competition cannot be considered in current terms , because the use of those technologies is undergoing a dramatic increase and we therefore have to view the issue with a little perspective .
I wish to finish , however , by congratulating you and giving you my support on one particular matter , that of equality between men and women .
I believe that the first thing I said in my speech was that in the Spanish state fundamental rights are being suspended as the result of the actions of violent people .
Within the Agenda 2000 package , the financial discussions should not allow us to forget that there are certain basic aims forming part of the European Union &apos; s policy which we must not rene@@ ge on .
This very morning I read a press note from one of the employers in the road ha@@ ula@@ ge sector . It complained about the White Paper , regretting that it was too rail @-@ orien@@ tated .
In my view , this is another indication of the European Union &apos; s goodwill and readiness for dialogue . However , I am bound to condemn the fact once again that - judging by the latest news - this is not an attitude which is shared by Canada .
I am therefore convinced that the reforms proposed - by consensus , I would repeat - by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will go in that direction .
Furthermore , it is estimated that two thirds of the new jobs will be created within small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
I am perfectly aware of the limitations that the Commissioner pointed out , because concluding an association agreement , in this case with Mercosur , requires political will on both sides .
Therefore , from the outset , the Commission is proposing different treatment for the European Women &quot; s Lobby and for all the other organisations .
It should also contribute to ensuring that more resources are provided for the complete clearing of mines , since mines which are still buri@@ ed are causing death and mutilation throughout the world , and the parties involved - State and non @-@ State agents - should be forced to reach an agreement on a total ban of these mines .
In fact , a supposedly civilised society such as ours , which flies the flag of human rights , cannot tolerate the manipulation of the human being , even in its embryonic state , however noble the objective may be .
However , it must be noted that there is still a lack of transparency as regards the implementation of various parts of Section I , so information is rather scant : E@@ pic@@ entre , security , cleaning and maintenance .
In particular , I am awaiting a response to the delicate issue of the famous ports of refuge ; in principle , the Member States of the Union have the time limit of February 2004 , but I hope they will communicate it to us before that - some countries are beginning to work on this - and I hope that they will do so before the summer .
I believe that this is something that needs to be pointed out .
I am truly impressed by the ambition of the Minister for External Affairs .
In this strong Europe , we will probably have to dispen@@ se with the expression &apos; improving coordination &apos; , as it means that everything is dependent on the subjects that have to be coordinated and inevitably leads to paralysis and a lack of clarity .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on an issue that is particularly sensitive , because armed conflicts affect women especially .
Commissioner Patten rightly stated that the substance of this report will guide and inspire us in our relations with Russia .
From the first economic crisis in 19@@ 29 , we learnt that the public authorities have a commitment to restoring growth and employment ; from the second economic crisis , which was the rebuilding of Europe following the Second World War , that the new Europe should be built on foundations of social justice .
Commissioner , the workers are asking for security and Europe must give it to them ; it must give them clarity , it must give them the right to be informed and consulted .
But what we do not want is to allow ourselves to be deceived and forget that the other dissidents are still in prison and that this imprisonment and the conditions involved , which contravene all international conventions in the field , are a flagrant violation of fundamental rights .
There are positive examples in the whole of Europe ( in Spain , for example , in the field of education ) .
In my opinion , given that the Court of Auditors &apos; report on the shortcomings of the control policy is still making the headlines and it has been decided to tackle once and for all the fight against illegal fishing , it is not very acceptable to claim that some agreements should continue to be outside a general framework that is very necessary as a basic legal guarantee of equal and non @-@ discriminatory treatment , both among operators and among Member States .
We are not happy with the thresholds proposed by the European Commission , since they should be adjusted in accordance with market fluctuations .
We have logically opposed the amendments which do not take account of the scientific possibilities of controlling the problem .
I hope that in the case of other measures , such as combating money laundering and so many others which are on the table in the Council , we will not wait until we have to act in haste , until there are other dramatic events , in order to implement them .
With regard to the first point , there is concern for the methodology .
Mr President , the Committee on Budgets believes that it is of the utmost importance that each of the budgetary instruments be clearly de@@ mar@@ cated .
These are two strategic sectors in terms of maintaining jobs and of the Union &quot; s food supply .
The Commission told us yesterday , through Commissioner Fischler , during the evening debate , that it was against Amendment No 20 , that it was against the other amendments by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , from No 21 to No 29 , and said that they were contrary to the Treaty on the accession of Spain and Portugal .
We need to hold a dialogue on traditional terminology , certific@@ ations and wine @-@ making practices and , in particular , it is necessary to create a joint committee for wine @-@ making issues .
And therefore , in the end , as we usually do in the European institutions , we reached a compromise agreement and this additional period was set at three years .
I should like to repeat to Mr Nogueira that nobody uphol@@ ds the preservation of the institutional balance in the famous Council @-@ Parliament @-@ Commission institutional triangle more firmly than the Spanish Presidency .
That is why I firmly support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to the Commission proposal on a budgetary increase for the programme and the need to recognise a legal status for European voluntary service .
In this respect , we are entirely in favour of and delighted by the resumption of negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of Tibet , and we ple@@ ad for a mutually acceptable solution based on respect for the religious and cultural rights of minorities and within the framework of the territorial integrity of the single State of China .
With regard to nuclear security , our interest focuses on the signing by Russia of the agreement known as the Multilateral Nuclear and Environment Progra@@ m in the Russian Federation .
I have not followed this directive for the full 10 years , Mr Rothley , but ever since I arrived at this Parliament , this directive has been on the table , causing problems .
We all agree that Europe is faced with the effects of climate change , the rising crude prices and the tension with Russia over the supply of gas .
The text of the instrument is consistent with the European consensus on development and with the various strategies that we have been approving , particularly the European strategy for the development of Africa .
It represents a considerable change in mentality for the business world to consider respect for the environment more as a factor of competitiveness and progress , rather than as an anno@@ ying legal obligation , in many cases at heavy financial cost and with a questionable degree of appreciation of the effort on the part of consumers .
We therefore need to pay more attention to the quality of public finances without compromising long @-@ term stability and sustainability .
For all these reasons , the European United Left will support the setting @-@ up of a committee of inquiry which focuses on the political decisions adopted , with a view to safeguarding the public interest .
From the founding spirit of the San Francisco Charter to the twenty @-@ first century , from 60 nations to 190 , from colonial regimes to independence and from the fall of the system of blocs to today &quot; s globalised world .
These States are : Finland , Denmark , Spain and Portugal .
We think it is a positive step that for the first time , at the request of the French Government , there has been a summit on employment , which is the biggest problem faced by European society and the societies of our individual countries .
We have made some progress in terms of opening up science , in terms of achieving the maximum transfer of scientific knowledge and technical information and supporting all incentives that promote the transfer of technologies , so that companies , civil society and universities can develop bridges between research and the necessary economic and technological renewal in our current European societies , thanks to this communication and thanks to the rules on the obligatory publication of results , the promotion of free software or the obligation , for example , to promote interoperability ; we have made some progress , but we must continue to make more .
I would ask the Commission for fewer initiatives .
The stated objectives are being satisfactorily achieved .
I do not recall that the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council mentioned this declaration , which defines our framework ; I do not know whether that is because a Socialist government adopted it , but in any case , as it was the Presidency of the Union , I recommend that he should take it into account this May , and Mr Elles will not deny this since we worked together at the time for the Spanish Government to push this very important declaration through the Council .
The fact that this illegal fishing cannot be prevented leads to losses and poverty for their coastal populations that depend on fishing for a living and for a secure source of food .
We have not been capable of understanding that , as is the case for any living organis@@ m , growing is not the same thing as getting fat .
This is no doubt due to the fact that it is a complicated and ambitious process , but we should also remember that it is a necessary reform , and we therefore hope that the Commission will take very good account of the recommendations made to it .
Mr President , in Lisbon in December 2007 , the Heads of State or Government of the European Union adopted the Joint Africa @-@ EU Strategy and the first Action Plan for its implementation .
We are finally in a position to initiate guaranteed planning for Galileo &apos; s deployment phase .
As you are going to present your proposals on the CAP &apos; health check &apos; to us in November , I would prefer to tell you now what I think , and say that I hope that in this &apos; health check &apos; you will analyse whether the CAP is in line with the new requirements of the global market , because one of the principal causes of the restriction of European production has , I am convinced , been the lack of foresight by Community experts .
Moreover , un@@ documented workers do not dare to contact the authorities to seek protection , claim their rights or access health services because they fear being returned to their home country and / or punishment by their employer .
And all the honourable Members of this House know that Dr Blix , a great European by the way - as he said himself yesterday ? and a man who believes in the values of Europe , spoke to you yesterday with a degree of pessimism in his heart .
Two different issues have emerged during this debate .
We are also talking about a very important European small or medium @-@ sized enterprise , the transport enterprise , which we must promote and whose competitiveness we must defend .
Finally , Mr President , I have a comment about Turkey .
There are other issues in relation to these species , such as the suitability of the TAC and quota system for managing these stocks , which is extremely difficult to do because these are mixed fisheries .
Why are we not asking Mr Solana and the Palestinian Authority to strengthen the administration of the latter , and helping them both to achieve that aim ?
Thus the first generation agreements were born and the economic contributions which improved cooperation were increased .
There are fleets which fulfill all the technical requirements .
Mr President , we are clearly facing an unprecedented crisis in the Middle East , which is all the more serious given that there is a risk of it spreading .
To achieve this , as Mr Albertini says in his report , we need innovative measures and instruments .
There is not much time left , perhaps a decade , but not much more .
I would also like to mention some other aspects of the Council conclusions .
This is clear when you travel around the Union and see how the diverse spiritual trends over the centuries have been embodied in our monu@@ ments , artistic st@@ yles , value systems , religious and spiritual trends , and schools of philosoph@@ ical and scientific thought .
Firstly , with regard to the assessment of what is happening and of what is going to happen in relation to the evolution of oil prices and its impact on the European economy in general .
It has also happened recently in another field , with Equi@@ table Life , when the financial sector was in@@ adequately regulated .
It is not excessive to say that , if employment among women were not taken into account , in some regions of the Union there would even be full employment .
Otherwise the public will not understand why we are voting on a text tomorrow that is already useless because there is an agreement outside Parliament .
What I am saying is that we should act together , because this is extremely important and , if you read the Madrid Declaration carefully , it states what the European Union has been saying for a long time , and it is other countries , including , to a large extent , the United States , that have come around to the positions of the European Union .
The vote will take place today .
It is in defence of our obligations and commitments to the ACP countries that the amendments have been presented on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
I know you are not guilty of this , and I would like to say that , as a result of your tenacity , your work and your intelligence , many European citizens , many of my neighbours , have felt freer .
The inclusion of a social clause seems to me to be an excellent idea .
Following these four procedures for setting up and enlarging the euro zone , from next year it will have fifteen Member States , another two have an opt @-@ out clause ( the United Kingdom and Denmark ) and a further ten Member States do not yet belong to the zone and I hope that they will join over the next few years .
Mr President , tomorrow the European Parliament will adopt a resolution on Iran which will be supported by our political Group .
We have yet to develop the justice aspect - and this is now urgent - for it is the only way of counter@@ balancing this repressive function of the State with the function of adminis@@ tering justice or , as Mrs Gebhardt has so rightly said , of giving European citizens fundamental judicial security .
It is true that we must reconcile solidarity with some of our least @-@ favoured sectors , such as the rural population or certain types of production , with solidarity with the least favoured countries .
I say that the situation is economically confused because , while I agree with the Commission &apos; s view that the economic situation is good , or at least much better than it was previously , I must emphasise that our potential 2 % growth is not enough to absorb Europe &apos; s unemployed , to keep pace with our competitors or to maintain our standard of living .
They need to be informed and convinced of the commercial advantages of advance supply .
An illustration of that confusion is the extension of the Community transit system to the Vise@@ grad countries .
If you do not want us to support you , let us know and next time we will not do it .
If the American President , Mr Bush , had the level of attribu@@ tions , competences and powers that our President , Mr Prodi , has , do you think he would have the influence and capacity he has in international relations and at domestic level ? Would he have the same influence and capacity ?
