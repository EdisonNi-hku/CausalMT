I have also noted the various proposals and suggestions that you have put forward .
We will not see food prices returning to their former levels , and volatility could increase if measures are not taken swiftly .
My second sentiment is , when I listened to Mr Solana , who spoke with a great deal of honesty - and I am more than happy to acknowledge this - and impartiality today , what I felt , as well , was a certain feeling of helpl@@ essness . It is true that the European Union has so far been unable to find the resources required in order to put all its weight behind finding a solution which would bring an end this situation .
We need discussions , not threats .
As regards the financing of these guarantee funds , Amendment No 6 hypo@@ critically states that &apos; the employers shall contribute to the financing , unless it is fully covered by the public authorities &apos; .
Mr Lannoye specifically mentioned the problem of closer cooperation .
Do we identify the same ones ?
The Heads of Government have taken on their responsibilities , and the countries have taken on theirs .
Surely it is about time the peoples of Europe took hold of their destiny ?
Effec@@ tive machinery must be deployed to monitor the activities of European undertakings in particular .
Honourable Members , as you can see , cluster munitions are an issue that pres@@ ses the European Union to act , and it must continue to press at an international level for the adoption of a universal instrument .
He wrote in his report , and I quote : &apos; the Community &quot; s agencies do not always have a good image or receive a good press &quot; .
At the stage we are already at with this matter , we could have prevented this further blow to the way in which European integration is viewed .
Our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subjects , is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully .
When you look at the R@@ AL@@ s , at the beginning of the year for example , you do not gain an accurate picture because , although almost 99 % of expenditure was committed in April , the payments can be made up to the end of the year .
Where was your Commissioner then ?
The increasing transfer of responsibilities from the basic systems to the supplementary health insurance systems is doubly disadvanta@@ geous in that it reduces the obligations of these systems , while at the same time weakening non @-@ profit @-@ making mutual insurance companies which reject risk selection .
If another accident were to happen , how would we be able to justify the European Parliament adopting such a slow timetable in order to wait for the IMO to reach a compromise at global level , where there are so many countries accommodating flags of convenience , which are not the most zealous militants on behalf of safety ?
I say yes to renewables , but not as a pretext for extending the powers of the European Union .
It is important that the countries who want to do something together do so voluntarily and that all countries have the option of joining in at any time .
Lastly , in Mr Olsson &apos; s report , I cannot support item 24 , as I reject the idea of turning our farmers into gar@@ den@@ ers and ri@@ ding instruc@@ tors , as it stipulates .
Amendment No 3 broad@@ ens the terms of this measure .
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , the revolutions in the Arab world are consistent with the aspirations of the Palestinian people .
I have always paid tribute to the expertise and commitment of the humanitarian organisations that are our partners , but the remarks that I heard from a number of them about the food crises in Africa , whether in the Sahel , the Horn of Africa or South Africa , asserting that the problem was due to the inadequate donor response , surprised me .
The coordinator is giving special priority to the Stuttgart @-@ Ulm bottlen@@ eck , which absolutely must be reduced .
. Mr President , there are no institutional barriers separating one group from another , and there is nothing to prevent anyone from demonstrating their worth and being rewarded for it .
That method was respected and involved us in a major consultation process .
I heard it said just now that this is not enough , but it is already a good start .
There must be a swift , impartial , effective inquiry into these massacres .
As old as the world , I should say because , beyond Israel , it is the Jews that the Iranian President is targeting .
With my Group , I ask that the conclusion be delayed until the autumn , unless a few vital improvements are made by the time of the Amsterdam summit .
To allow the European Parliament to exercise the powers it possesses under the Treaty of Lisbon , the Commission must give us a new draft regulation by June 2010 at the latest .
Banana producers have a right , under the same heading as other agricultural producers , to support from the Union and to the benefits of Community preference .
For its part , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy pointed out , very appropriately , that the discussions with the United States on the transatlantic marketplace should have respected the acquis communautaire , particularly in the agriculture sector , the association agreements and the Lom√© Convention , which is far from being the case .
Of course , we need strong European economic governance , but first we need to deal with the havoc caused by this debt . If we believe that we can resolve the problem by simply cutting back on public spending , then we are not facing up to reality .
In the last few years , the news has highlighted food scandals and consumers are rightly demanding to be very well informed about the products that they buy .
He has considerable experience of both institutions , fortunately , which is to our benefit .
We therefore request that the legislative procedures envisaged by the Treaty of Amsterdam be applied properly .
Mrs Doyle , you were as good as your word .
I think we are currently making progress .
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000 .
I therefore voted for this report , as I did for the other three , to reiterate my commitment to this fundamental policy , whilst at the same time calling for certain changes that have become necessary for dealing with new challenges .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , since the digitisation of cultural and artistic assets , I believe that the question is the following : is Europe destined to become a land of consumption for the United States , and soon for emerging countries , or will it finally wake up and put resources towards developing its inform@@ ational , cultural but also economic potential ?
This means that we will certainly not be able to finish the current debate at 11.@@ 30 a@@ .m .
We are , in fact , a Community based on the rule of law .
That is the purpose of the contract for the Millennium Goals on which the Commission is currently working - a matter on which I touched briefly yesterday when I replied in committee to our colleague , Mr van den Berg - and we shall be able , in the weeks ahead , to discuss with you the criteria and the conditions of this contract for the Millennium Goals .
First we have to keep our heads , which means that amid all the emotion and horror it is not our job to cas@@ tig@@ ate one side or the other .
To move quickly and to enable Europe to make progress were the commitments made by the UMP candidate , Nicolas Sarkozy , and such is the mandate given to the new President of the French Republic by the people of France .
They must be involved , as the recommendation states , by the Member States and the sectoral dialogue committees at Community level .
All the candidates at the hearings showed different , but complementary , personal qualities , and the competence and integrity necessary to their function .
I say &apos; no &quot; to accession , but &apos; yes &quot; to close and privileged cooperation , and to a strong partnership agreement .
First of all , I do not see why - and I hope that Parliament will support me on this point - Europol staff should be given a salary increase of 5.@@ 2 % for the period 1 July 2001 to 1 July 2002 , when , over the same period , European Union officials based in the Netherlands - in the same city of The Hague - will receive an increase in their salary and allowances of 4.@@ 3 % .
Similarly , the single authority should be able to delegate some of its powers to other authorities or to stock exchanges .
Lastly , I think it is unfair to introduce the requirement for suitable housing as an additional condition to avoid granting status to third @-@ country nationals legally residing in the European Union .
The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Ries , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields .
However , insufficient private investment in new high @-@ risk small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ( SME ) , will leave green technology innovation in Europe largely dependent on public fun@@ d@@ ing@@ .@@ According to the OECD , intergovernmental coordination is vital in the EU with its 27 national innovation policies and a ple@@ thor@@ a of EU programmes ( for example , E@@ ER@@ P , SE@@ T plan , N@@ ER 300 , Europe IN@@ NO@@ V@@ A , Cohesion Fund ) .
An@@ gel@@ ism in the face of fundamentalism is synonymous with cowardice and ab@@ dication .
On this point I would like to recall that in 1996 the European Union imported about 500 , 000 live animals from third countries .
I should like to respond in particular to three points : firstly , the composition ; secondly , possible conflicts of interest ; thirdly , cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission , thinking in particular of the framework agreement .
We are a long way from displaying the same enthusiasm when it comes to meeting the challenges posed by social inclusion and the need to create a Europe that works for everyone , a Europe capable of promoting not just more jobs but better jobs too .
That is a second observation that we will perhaps have to come back to in our opinion , as I have said to Mr Brok and Mr Gu@@ al@@ tier@@ i , the two rapporteurs for our committee .
Finally , there is Europe &apos; s inertia regarding the Palestinian problem .
It must be acknowledged that the law of free competition and the single market too often prevails over all other requirements and effectively flouts social rights and fundamental rights .
In the meantime the acts of violence continue .
Having made these comments , I can of course go along with the Commission and accept that the European Parliament should , in this exceptional case - without a report and in accordance with the urgent procedure - today approve the text which is before it .
After all , how many children will have to be raped , kidnapped , even murdered before we finally come up with the solutions we need ?
Furthermore , it is impossible to have an honest and effective cohesion policy without the European Union &apos; s budget being increased .
For example , recitals C and F , on the asymmetric shocks that threaten the euro zone , highlight a genuine problem for the future .
History also te@@ aches us that the centres of growth in Europe were often small States or free cities particularly in Italy or F@@ land@@ ers , and not large artificially unified continental conglomerates .
It is blatantly obvious that the intention is to establish a long @-@ term rule of wage austerity which will ensure a high level of financial profits but which is also very likely to ensure a long @-@ term slide into recession and unemployment .
It takes time to eliminate the political pressures and political selection criteria that were normal under the former regimes .
In general , the principles which apply are those of non @-@ discrimination and of proportionality and the national treatment principle .
Naturally , all these questions would benefit from a lengthy discussion , but I would like to attempt to provide you with some initial answers , in the tel@@ eg@@ raphi@@ c style that we are using today .
Mr President , Commissioner , those of us who love Cuba and the honest and down @-@ to earth Cuban people are deeply upset to see human rights and in particular the right to freedom of expression persistently breached by President Castro &apos; s regime .
We have to increase this financial effort because it is the only means of restoring competences to the Haitian country and people .
Firstly , regarding the content , in striving to form alliances and to retain support in favour of a broad approach to the round , and secondly , on the form , the institutional plan and the procedures , in order to set in place all we shall need throughout future negotiations .
I have therefore voted in favour of this directive , which forms part of the general action plan to fight organised crime .
Another significant and positive step forward is the agreement concluded between the Council and the Commission , as a result of which the Commission must now submit a Let@@ ter of Amendment for agricultural expenditure to its preliminary draft budget , before the first reading of the budget , so that the budget forecasts can be better assessed , this being a difficult exercise as regards agriculture .
It is regrettable that the Commission makes no reference to this and I would draw your attention to the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development reminds you of this in its resolution .
Of course , I would point out that the medical staff are also bound by professional secrecy .
Foreign policy must remain under the sovereignty of nations .
Obviously , in the normal course of things , it is up to the Council to consult the European Parliament .
I believe the Commission &quot; s proposal of including human rights and governance as complementary objectives to poverty reduction meets Parliament &quot; s request perfectly .
The change could therefore begin by the refusal to invest you with the presidency .
After Amsterdam , fundamental decisions are expected .
You accuse me , for example - and if we were in the Belgian national Parliament I would have immediately reacted by appealing to the Rules of Procedure in order to respond to personal comments - of protecting Belgian economic interests .
With regard to the tools , I will cite just one example .
An amendment must be made through a proposal which must be discussed in the committee responsible .
. The Luxembourg Presidency is relying on the firm and resolute support of your Parliament in order to reach an agreement .
It must also be adapted to the socio @-@ economic situation in each of the countries .
Furthermore , this position - and this is my third remark - leads the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to propose a provision , unfortunately accepted earlier by a majority , which is not at all in accordance with our Rules .
The repeal announced of the current provisions of the criminal code , which is capable of limiting the freedom of the press , and , most importantly , the swift adoption of legislative provisions aimed at better protection of children , will be further tangible proof to us of the will of the Romanian authorities .
Can France , whose troops cam@@ ped outside S@@ reb@@ ren@@ it@@ za during the massacres ?
This work is in progress .
Now that , sadly , the conflict has f@@ la@@ red up again , we cannot be content to seek a return to the previous fragile status quo , but must seize this tragic opportunity to resolve the fundamental problems , and in accordance with the UN resolutions .
Yet neither the Treaties nor the budgetary regulations provide for this possibility .
I consider that Members of Parliament need further evidence before they can propose to grant or refuse discharge to this agency .
These three dimensions must be combined to enable us to respond both to the consumer &apos; s demands and those of the processing industry , but also to the need for a greater balance in rural society .
It still has work to do and I am sure that Mrs Gradin will confirm that .
Despite the obstacles , it continues to give humanitarian aid and assistance to the population of the Gaza Strip .
A large part of his career has been devoted to improving conditions for private enterprises in Sweden , as manager in organisations representing industry interests in public life .
This factor must be taken into account when discussing the preparation of the Seventh Framework Plan for research and the increase in funds , which I hope will be substantial , within the framework of the next financial perspectives .
This is an unacceptable situation and I feel that you must ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council to en@@ list the support of our Ambassad@@ ors in Te@@ h@@ ran to help ensure that human rights are respected .
In these circumstances the temptation to give unbridled capitalism full rein was too great .
So , we will not change our minds .
Article 26 ( 2 ) of the Constitution of the French Republic stipulates the same thing .
This is because a successful European research area is one of the key elements of our future economic growth .
Yes , ladies and gentlemen , we must , as Europeans , recognise that space is taking on a strategic defensive dimension .
Following that , there will be a political debate concerning the adoption of the third multiannual programme at the end of 2009 .
This is the first time that the Court in Strasbourg has dis@@ av@@ owed the military operations carried out by Ankara in Turkish Kur@@ dis@@ tan .
Why seek to gru@@ b up vineyards on our territory when Chile , Australia and the vineyards of the 3@@ 3@@ r@@ d parallel are planting ?
I have myself worked within presidency teams , in particular when negotiating the agreement on fighting desertification - the Intergovernmental Forum on Fo@@ rests - in New York .
Mr President , the preparations for the vote on this budget required the Committee on Budgets to engage in a dual exercise , which merits first and foremost , I believe , a dual salute : to the chairman of the committee , Mr Samland , and to the rapporteur , Mr Brinkhorst .
Since 11 September , Member States &apos; authorities have strengthened existing protective systems and physical protection measures that were already in force for at @-@ risk installations and more specifically for nuclear installations .
Finally we come to the great taboo , the question of who profits from the budget credits .
Mr President , the amendment to the directive on cosmetic products has provoked intense debate on the issue of animal testing .
Along with other Members of this House , I have therefore signed the appeal backed by the High Commissioner for Refugees stating that it is unacceptable to allow Europe to enjoy the benefits of its economic and financial environment yet ignore the distress beyond its borders .
This seems today to be not only desirable , but also possible .
Commissioner Busquin is expected to confirm this later .
Did they do this ?
The Johannesburg summit also reiterated the essential nature of respect for environmental and social standards and human rights .
This was , of course , the main topic of discussion when , recently , at the start of the week , we met the French President , who came - and we ought to welcome this - to explain to us , at Eurogroup , the new headings and the new aims of France &apos; s economic and budgetary policy .
The second point : I have probably spoken to you about a coordinator , a senior political figure who will promote the introduction of these operational blocks between the Member States .
I therefore hope that we shall soon vote in favour of a genuine framework resolution which will bring together all the measures needed to protect our environment .
I believe we should also give thought to combatting the laundering of money , and to the penalties to be imposed on banks , even if European banks are involved .
We are radically opposed to this way of thinking , which asks the Ukrainian authorities to give priority to encouraging &apos; private enterprise &apos; and &apos; internal investments &apos; , to establishing in Ukraine , obviously with the help of European and international financial institutions , &apos; a foreign investments promotion agency &apos; , or to accelerating &apos; agricultural reform &apos; and &apos; the transition to private ownership of the land &apos; .
Of course , we must obviously stress the need for research in order to minimise the production of waste and risks to safety .
It has ignored the advances of its political platform , on which the National Unity Government was built ; it has refused to condemn Israel for taking and imprison@@ ing 45 Palestinian Members of Parliament .
This list must be accompanied by practical measures such as the establishment of objectives to be achieved by the Member States and the obligation on the latter to prepare periodic reports on the progress achieved .
We are coming to the end of a long road of negotiations , and I would like to congratulate all those involved , in particular my fellow Members from my political group .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me firstly to provide answers to your written question regarding the simplification of the common agricultural policy , an important subject , as I have repeatedly said since I became Commissioner , and which we will take into consideration for future legislation .
The proposal for a directive creates a whole new category , subsidiary protection , which is in addition to the status of refugee provided for under the Geneva Convention .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - I accept my responsibilities . Mr President , I can assure you that you are not here for nothing .
It would have made no sense to reject the College .
At the same time , the Community , in its &apos; least developed countries &apos; initiative within the framework of the WTO , seeks to associate other commercial partners to this market opening policy of ours , which would consist of exempting essentially all the products of L@@ LDCs from duties and quotas .
In order to put things right though , Mr President , we will need more than a new Code of Conduct .
Cyprus has a viable and prosperous market economy and should not encounter any particular problems in adopting the acquis communautaire .
Yet we are not starting from scratch , since the Union is already India &apos; s main trading partner , the main investor in India and the main destination for Indian investors , and India is also the main beneficiary of the system of generalised preferences .
We have reviewed our own programmes based on those of the African Union , proposing to align European aid for agriculture and rural development with the African Union &apos; s agricultural development programme un@@ veiled in June 2007 .
We must not only deplore the loss of thousands of lives in New York and Washington . We must also lament the fact that there are tens of thousands of other victims amongst the children of the poorest countries in the world .
- We would have voted in favour of those amendments seeking to provide better compensation for passengers , but since all the amendments are in practice voted on en bloc , we did not want to back those which exempt certain service providers , such as tour operators , or which aim to reduce the obligations of the airlines .
The fact is that , as I mentioned earlier , eight of the nine countries bordering the Baltic are Member States , benefiting from the EU &quot; s internal policies and programmes .
Under such conditions , their children &quot; s education is mort@@ gag@@ ed right from the start .
This incident , at a time when pressure on the organisers of and participants in the protest movement is being stepped up , is all the more worrying in that the Moldo@@ van parliament has just voted to lift the immunity on several other members of the opposition , as Mr Swoboda has just pointed out .
The truth - as many economists have stressed and continue to do so - is that it would be difficult to sustain the sort of public debt levels that we see in the United States , and that it is the countries with the most debt that are the largest consumers , whereas those with larger reserves consume the least .
We were disappointed Madam President , I shall not pretend otherwise , with the Council Budget .
Obviously all that must be taken into account , in one sense or another .
That does not stop it from drafting directives that send out messages to the Member States with the aim of ensuring that Community law is effective .
Everyone would like to have suitable housing .
I would like to point something out to you that is rather odd : in the United States , the use of s@@ qual@@ ene in ad@@ juv@@ ants has been prohibited , but the European Medicines Agency has authorised it since most vaccines contain s@@ qual@@ ene .
The EU &apos; s new plan for the economy for the next ten years refers to workforce mobility as an essential condition for reducing unemployment .
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .
It is better to have a dissatisfied passenger who is alive than a passenger who , unfortunately , dies on board .
Therefore , quite rightly , the Commission has taken the initiative to amend the 1984 Directive which - I must say this and I go along completely with Mrs Flem@@ ming - is a good proposal , even if we thought it was helpful to amend it in a way which is relatively marginal .
Busin@@ esses and our States cannot support this additional huge financial burden at this time of crisis .
I can bear witness to this because yesterday , I chaired a meeting of all the groups of this Parliament where a draft joint resolution was finalised which , unlike others , will not be a compromise text and will in no way be a compromise between divergent positions , but will indeed be a synthesis enriched by the proposals of each of the political families united in a common desire to offer Parliament &apos; s contribution to a political solution of the tragic situation currently causing bloodshed in Chechnya .
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative un@@ wiel@@ d@@ iness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions .
Let us take the example of the Marrakech Agreements on agriculture .
The Europe we are now building on a constitutional and legislative level sadly does not contribute to this in any way .
It is true that this proposal represents an historic stage in the development of European short @-@ stay visa policy within the context of our relations with the countries of the Western Balkans .
In my opinion , this constitutes a twofold error , because , even if the concept of transvers@@ ality is a good one , in practice it is completely unrealistic .
The second category of people responsible is , of course , the Member States .
As you know , the Convention has already received a number of contributions on the subject of services of general interest .
With the GSP , the Union has a means of fostering not only the integration of developing countries within world trade , but also of spreading good governance .
Clearly I cannot get involved in the direct management of developing countries .
That is why I would opt for a measured tone in relation to the situation so that we leave an opportunity for negotiations , which should take place very urgently and , I hope , reach a conclusion .
I would like to stress that , during this procedure , cooperation between the three institutions was particularly productive .
I think that , given all the problems we face - and since I heard you mention courage earlier - it would show courage to persevere with the precautionary principle and take time to verify the facts of the situation .
It is , in fact , a matter of survival for Europe and its social model .
I think the time is right to clearly reiterate the terms of the unequivocal declaration adopted by the Berlin European Council in March 1999 , in which the Fifteen stated that they were ready to recognise a Palestinian State .
Neither European Union nor United Nations resolutions have acknowledged the escalation of the ethnic conflicts in Nigeria .
No one is fooled by this small number of complaints , particularly not the human rights associations which are being overwhelmed by thousands of calls .
It is thanks to these things that we will be able to implement the new Eurojust decision quickly .
Let us come forward as credible spokes@@ people ready to rise to the sizeable challenge represented by the management of migratory pressure at the frontiers of Europe .
Our Parliament must ensure that the proposed support is set at a sufficient level and that it takes account of possible price changes during negotiations at the World Trade Organisation .
Consequently , I believe that we must vote today .
Mr President , Commissioner Solbes M@@ ira , President Duisenberg , ladies and gentlemen , I should like , if I may , to deal swiftly with various questions in relation to the work of the European Central Bank .
Mr President , I beg your pardon , but the French interpre@@ ter made a small error , on the most sensitive word in the debate , during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said .
We must put in the resources because , as many of you have pointed out , youth and education should be the top priority for the Union &apos; s future .
Here you merely shifted the same pieces about the board , you came out with more procedures , but changed nothing with regard to fundamentals .
We need a timetable , by all means , but a more gradual timetable .
I think it is worth remembering what the Commission was proposing concerning the role of Parliament , namely the simple for@@ warding to Parliament of an ex post evaluation focused on the entire programme , an evaluation drafted by the Commission one year after the programme &quot; s conclusion .
Over and above that , these are historic elections : this is the first democratic change in the Arab world .
I do not however consider this to be a purely linguistic or philosophical issue . It is an issue of crucial importance .
Italy is a great European country . It is also a country of great Europeans , and I am sure that , faithful to this heritage , the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the President of the Commission and the Vice @-@ President of the Convention will be very keen to agree upon essentials in order to give Europe a new face .
This week , it is imperative that a European solution is found to this crisis , and it must be a Community @-@ based solution - I repeat , a Community @-@ based solution - which must be envisaged in accordance with European rules and within the framework of European financial aid mechanisms .
Madam President , throughout successive historic periods , the land of Palestine has experienced marvellous forms of human coexistence and religious tolerance among various communities and religions .
A model based on enlargement , the WTO model , or a distorted European model ?
Mr Barroso , it is on television that we look for super@@ stars ; in this House we look for something else .
We must not only celebrate the courage and the memory of the workers of G@@ dan@@ sk and the role played by their strike in the fall of the Ir@@ on Cur@@ tain .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are all agreed that this attack in Bes@@ l@@ an was monstrous , and that those who perpetrated it showed themselves to be monsters by taking children hostage and demanding that their mothers should decide which children should die and which should survive .
Our common commitment is to secure an agreement at first reading , based on a timeframe that is compatible with international obligations and the European Parliament elections .
The President is right .
Perhaps it is better to be a smo@@ ker in the countryside than a non @-@ smo@@ ker in the town .
The ECB used to say that this is no time for complacency .
For example , the matter of the operation of the Court of Justice , or even the matter of more concerted European action in the fight against fraud .
For a long time now I been taking not of Charles Pasqua &apos; s comments on gastronom@@ y , and indeed on other matters , and so I was very interested to hear him speak , there is no question of that , even if I did not completely recognise the Europe that we are building together from his remarks and description .
So far as the freedom of the press is concerned , the existence of free pluralist media strengthens the principle of democracy .
I am keen on quite a few of the ideas that are circulating and that have emerged here this afternoon .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it could perhaps be said quite simply that witch @-@ hunting has started up once again in Egypt , since a number of writers and artists are now being censured and their basic rights are being threatened ,
Regarding public services , a subject mentioned by a number of speakers , the last of whom was Mr Saint @-@ Jos@@ se , I should like to say that the French Presidency is very attentive to this matter .
We must remember that this initiative is the result , unfortunately , of a series of repeated scandals connected , on the one hand , with the desire to increase agricultural productivity and , on the other , with the monopoly enjoyed by the major distributors , which have led to health @-@ conscious , industrial farming but have not prevented the development of scandalous trends such as chicken containing dioxin , trafficking in veterinary products of all kinds , and in particular the fundamental crisis of BSE .
A deficit caused by consumer spending should not be considered as being identical to one resulting from productive investment , from investment in the future .
The report &apos; s recommendations lay great emphasis on the role of small and medium @-@ sized companies .
I was going to add &apos; unfortunately &apos; , because I believe that it would be useful to examine in detail the role of the markets and the role future products might have in this area .
Il@@ legal ship @-@ owners exploit underpaid crews and sell fishery products at very low prices .
I am pleased to note that the opinions of the European Parliament are similar to those of the Commission with regard to the measures to be taken to improve the fight against VAT fraud within the European Union . I am particularly happy about the widespread support for the main objective of the Commission &apos; s first concrete proposal , namely to accelerate , by January 2010 , the gathering and exchange of information concerning intra @-@ community transactions .
An extra USD 100 billion needs to be found each year .
In addition , analysis of the structural factors leads us to fear a further escalation of prices of agricultural raw materials in the medium and long term .
Two approaches are becoming clear , one of which is a pragmatic approach .
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable .
Mr President , I want to give an oral explanation of vote because what has happened , once again , is not very good news for our Parliament .
What would its place be in the new majority decision @-@ making process ?
It is on behalf of these silent victims of the genocide under way in Darfur that I have taken the floor today to direct an urgent appeal - a cry of distress - to you .
The second aspect is that , like many , I am astonished that rivers are not covered by any safety regulations .
The regions must be able to count on the Member States to obtain genuine political and legal representation within the Union .
I would call on the Council to intervene speedily in order to ensure that the conditions established by the United Nations are respected by that date and that the Sah@@ ra@@ w@@ i people can express their right to self @-@ determination and independence .
Poli@@ tically , we do nothing , however .
I should also tell you regarding this that I had no trouble getting in direct , personal contact with Mr Od@@ ing@@ a .
Mr Berlusconi &apos; s astounding and deeply shameful words show how important it is to issue a very clear response .
It is time to promote apprenticeshi@@ p as a modern and dynamic form of training .
Those jobs which are created tend to be precarious , particularly where they involve women and young people .
It is not Turkey that I am opposing by voting against this progress report .
Furthermore , no Member State totally escap@@ es the risk of disturbances , even if some international matches are more sensitive than others and the supporters of some clubs or national teams are seemingly easier to control than others .
I should , however , point out that , apart from the developments in technology that are giving the per@@ verts many more opportunities to satisfy their cra@@ v@@ ings , we should also look at moral dec@@ adence and the lowering of values as further reasons for the large increase in this type of crime .
I will ask the Socialist Group to remove a small section of their amendment , which states &apos; can be sometimes in practice &apos; .
Were they to be implemented , the measures recommended by the Council would represent a step backwards in relation to the current rights of workers , which would not be worthy of a Europe that is supposed to be both competitive and social .
Mr President , at the time of the vote on the original budget for 1996 , my group could only protest against a draft budget that was irresponsible because it was constantly increasing .
These are not easy tasks by any means .
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , you said a moment ago , Baroness Ashton , that we must respect peoples and their desire for freedom .
At the end of the day , it leaves those who have prof@@ ited most from the casino economy of the last 20 years in peace .
You will be aware that terrible things happen to these women , that they are tortured and their families threatened .
We will have the credit rating agencies proposal next month .
. - The aim of the Cercas report was to take a hard look at the directive setting the maximum weekly working hours in the countries of the European Union .
For instance , Corsica and French Hain@@ ault , in the Nord Pas de Calais region , have not received Structural Funds , intended for Europe &quot; s poor regions , for the last five years .
With a view to the proper management of ele@@ ph@@ ant populations in southern Africa ( Bot@@ sw@@ ana , Nami@@ bia , Zimbabwe and South Africa ) , we supported the amendments tabled by our group calling for the transfer to Appendix I to be postponed .
We were , in fact , in the majority in this House in condemning the methods adopted by the Russian army to quas@@ h under fire any sort of potential resistance to its advance without taking into consideration the losses thereby caused among the civilian population .
Objectives , strategy , method , financing - it all requires a totally new approach .
The real problem facing us is the call for genuine stabilisation of expenditure on the one hand and the need for a real reform of the common market organisations on the other .
Mr President , I should like to draw your attention , ladies and gentlemen , to an aspect of this resolution , which is of central and not secondary importance to me , and which can give the policies of regional cohesion their full meaning .
Between the joint decision on the multiannual financial framework taken in May 2006 and now , there has been the financial crisis , the very strong pressures on the price of energy , raw materials and even foodstuffs , and the negotiations on climate change .
Thirdly , the consolidation of our strong points , the laun@@ cher and satellite business .
Since 1993 , 50 % of the Cambodian forest has been destroyed with the complicity of a corrupt government .
But personal and family tragedies , incalculable losses for the European and international communities caused by each sinking of an illegal tanker , destroying the socio @-@ economic fabric of the coasts for years and damaging ecosystems and marine biodiversity for centuries !
With regard to special measures justified in the name of public order , the Commission gives examples of many cases of incorrect interpretations , such as criminal convictions that justify systematic deportation and expulsion .
Mr Sharon is aware that what he is doing in Israel is simply a copy of what the United States &apos; leaders did in Afghanistan and are preparing to do in Iraq .
Over the years , important legislation on equal treatment and gender mainstreaming in European policies has allowed us to move towards a more egalitarian society and labour market .
Even our relations with the Council are deteriorating .
In establishing this development cooperation instrument , the European Union is , more than ever , establishing itself as a leader in this field .
As you know , we fought together , at the previous Intergovernmental Conference - at which the Treaty of Nice , as we call it , was draw up - in order to enhance Parliament &apos; s competences in the area of trade policy .
Given their historic responsibility for Haiti &apos; s mis@@ fortunes , it is obscene for France and the United States to pretend to know what is best .
That is why I am not calling on you to say that the policy of Europe and of this Parliament is guided only by human rights .
As far as pluralism is concerned as well , we can discuss the subject , we can take action , and this is what I have tried to do in a small way .
And we have the means : support for bio @-@ fuels , the safety net for oil @-@ rich crops , supplementary aid for protein @-@ rich crops , intensification of the public research effort and agri @-@ environmental aid for farms which include le@@ gu@@ min@@ ous fodder in their rotation .
After a first failed attempt , it was about time that beneficiaries of international protection finally enjoyed equal treatment with other third @-@ country nationals who are long @-@ term residents .
I do not believe , however , that the motion before us deals with the problem correctly .
Is energy a &apos; common asset &apos; or just a commodity ?
I had two and a half hours of quite intense meetings and discussions with the Minister for Pl@@ anning - who obviously held most authority and was certainly the most authoritarian of the three I met - the Minister for Social Wel@@ fare and the Minister for Health .
Faced with such an urgent demand , the State , local authorities and community groups are mobilising throughout France .
Since 2003 the countries of the Western Balkans have had a clear European perspective . That process is critical for ensuring peace and stability in Europe .
Whilst allowing more flexibility in the system for adapting the legislation in the regulatory procedure with scrutiny , all this provides a counterbalance in the general implementing legislation .
I am very afraid that this presence will be like the ruined ca@@ the@@ dra@@ l which overlooks the city and of which only the fa√ßade remains . It will only be a rem@@ nant of what was , an illusion simply serving as an alibi for abandonment by the West , with g@@ aping holes which , in the past , gave access to a wonderful structure and which will now be open only to the wind .
This &apos; laissez @-@ faire , let it in &apos; attitude of the Commission during the 2001 @-@ 2002 campaign has been perpetuated in the form - for the time being the reduced form - of tariff quotas for categories of cereals of which we produce a surplus .
As far as the fight against terrorism is concerned , there is , unfortunately , no need to dwell at length on the tragedies that too often plunge the people of Spain into mourning , as they fall victim to barbaric acts carried out by ETA and its counterparts .
Of course , you will say that the Commissioners responsible are no longer the same . I would point out , however , that Commissioners are responsible for the actions of the Commission as a whole , and that if there was a breakdown in the operation of the Commission , then the College of Commissioners currently in office is responsible .
Is that true ?
The Commission should ensure that all the Member States keep to this strategy as a whole , and not only to a few structural reforms , which are necessary but not sufficient to create the most competitive knowledge and &apos; well @-@ being &apos; based society in the world .
In view of the marked differences in performance between the eurozone and the countries outside the euro , the question certainly needs to be asked .
It is equally evident that what claims to be the European &apos; Union &quot; - a term I put in quotation marks - with its six doomed draft resolutions , none of which - this was last year , as you will recall - obtained anything like a majority , and with its immense jum@@ ble of useless and derisory pi@@ eties , has remained silent , with a passivity def@@ ying belief in the face of a war and a strategy that pits civilisations against each other , with the EU itself the first victim .
Europe &apos; s responsibility , Minister , is therefore becoming overwhelming .
We must facilitate administrative procedures , reduce time @-@ limits and do all we can to harmonise national safety regulations , which sometimes lead to major traffic restrictions for no good reason .
On Wednesday 24 December , the unknown cap@@ tain declared himself the President of the Republic , he was che@@ ered by thousands of Guine@@ ans and , on 25 December , he made a display of the allegiance offered by the civil government , who agreed to his ultimatu@@ m .
Our credibility in the eyes of Europeans is at stake following the statements in the future sustainable development strategy .
First of all , it is crucial to increase police cooperation in the exchange of information on illegal migration flows and on criminal networks .
I observe , in particular , that following our requests , the Committee on Budgets has proposed a substantial increase in the credits made available to the European Fund for Refugees , funds which the Council had rather im@@ prud@@ ently , not to say rather stupid@@ ly , cut .
If , like you , visitors come here , it is because they have chosen to come .
Mr President , I thank both Mr Marques and Mr Nogueira Rom√°n for their fine reports , as I thank all the speakers for their comments .
So the Council is bringing us back to reality , and it is doing so , I must admit , without making any major concessions .
Furthermore , during the last European Council the guidelines of the euro zone countries were unanimously confirmed - whether in terms of the measures to introduce regulation mechanisms , monitoring mechanisms or ethical rules putting a stop to golden parachutes .
Well , the Turks , who for more than twenty years have been occupying one third of the territory of Cyprus , a European state , are now killing Cypriots on that island .
There are numerous causes .
The R@@ AC@@ s can then take on a genuinely hands @-@ on managerial role in addressing the economic , social and environmental issues directly affected by the CFP .
If Europe wishes to be strong at the heart of international dialogues , so must all its law@@ makers be likewise .
It would in fact be more accurate to refer to a European Union @-@ NAF@@ TA agreement rather than an agreement associating the European Union with Mexico only . For this agreement , which the rapporteur herself describes as the most important one the European Union has ever signed with a third country , will not only affect our relations with Mexico but will also have implications for our relations with the North and Central American countries as a whole .
Ensuring that persons moving within the EU do not suffer disadvantages in their social security rights and consequently coordinating national social security legislation is , therefore , a crucial element , as a number of my fellow Members have said .
I feel that the important thing was for the Union to very swiftly communicate to this country not only a tangible message of encouragement but also , and I would stress this point , the political prospect of its full and comprehensive integration into the European family .
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe truly believe in em@@ u@@ lation which stimul@@ ates innovation .
I believe that your three principles are sound .
In this context , the Hoppenstedt report has come at an opportune moment .
We must then ask ourselves whether the concept of the single European area is relevant for the islands which , as they are isolated and out of touch , inevitably labour under mani@@ fold spatial and human limitations .
These proposals are a step in the right direction , but I believe that to ensure action for employment is effective and to improve economic performance in Europe , we could have gone further with regard to the right of employees to participate in the future of companies .
The Member States and the Commission are currently working on the issue of basic skills by implementing the work programme on objectives for education and training systems .
In the new strategy that is taking shape , Europe must initiate a new dynamic for peace in which it finally emb@@ races its own political role and ceases merely to be a source of funding .
We will have to find common ground .
We join him in condemning the inconsistency of the Council , which forgets the grand declarations that it makes at the six @-@ monthly European summits as soon as the Finance Ministers meet in the grey of a Brussels Monday .
This is clear evidence of double standards at Toul@@ on and at Strasbourg .
I should like to commend the European Commission &apos; s latest proposals in this regard , and particularly with regard to sever@@ ance agreements , bonuses paid to traders or speculative funds .
We are dealing with a topic that reflects the expectations of the people of Europe .
I am absolutely convinced that we should move in the direction of greater involvement of the European Union .
I think that we will have to attack the hard core of the neo @-@ liberal model , which perv@@ ades European integration to an excessive degree . I also think that we are going to have to listen as well as involve the social actors and citizens in this necessary change .
The rules that ensure freedom of communication between people are tim@@ eless and do not depend on one medium or another .
With regard to the second section , there are many problems in the way Directive 64 / 2@@ 21 / EEC has been implemented .
It is absolutely essential to make progress in the implementation of this road map .
We all now know that crews are particularly mixed , both in terms of nationalities and also of social and geographic origins .
Let it remain there .
The report itself contains the traditional request to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding , which would have the distinctive feature of removing the definition of a good number of citizens &apos; rights from national democracies .
Finally and above all , by showing considerable ambition , perhaps , by taking the initiative for a European Camp David that has become necessary since the roadmap bran@@ dis@@ hed by the Quartet comes down to nothing more than a pious hope .
Nor is it surprising that France , in Europe and throughout the world , symbolises resistance to imperial terrorism .
The contradiction in terms , however , is patently obvious . Every day we can see examples illustrating the lesson that purely economic development could not possibly be sustainable .
How can one reconcile a announced stimulus of EUR 7 billion through the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund with an announced structural budget under @-@ spend of EUR 10 billion in 2009 ?
We therefore consider that the French Socialists are supporting a good compromise .
Similarly instrumental were Parliament &quot; s determination , during negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference ( IGC ) , that the progress made at the Convention would not be un@@ done , and the regular , comprehensive consultations , conducted under Mr Napolitano &quot; s competent and constructive leadership in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
Mr Juncker , you put forward the idea of a speculation tax .
So , this budget , which is in@@ grati@@ ating , cosmetic , excessive and inflationary , ...
Please allow me a few weeks simply to take the time - I believe it will be time well spent - to meet with all of the key players in the banking sector .
It is also a question of making an effort to clarify the definition of their working conditions , which , I admit , are rather the preserve of internal meetings .
I think our position should therefore be implacable .
In conclusion , I wish to congratulate your Assembly on this report and to assure you that the Commission will heed your recommendations and follow them up .
On the other hand , I do not think it odd that Europe should be concerned about the health of the whole of its forest heritage , because air pollution , plant diseases and even natural or accidental disasters do not recognise borders .
Mr President , the real question before us is simply &apos; What Europe do we want ? &quot;
I refer Members interested in these issues to the minority opinion where I have set out my reservations .
The PD@@ B obviously did not take some items of expenditure into account , but it was very clear .
They may reveal the inadequacies of the rules laid down or the failings in how they are applied .
The Convention &quot; s draft Constitution , which the European Council rejected in Brussels , would not have changed anything , because it also subordin@@ ated services of general interest to competition law .
Thir@@ ty years ago , great countries in the South of Europe lived under dictatorship , and Eastern Europe was subs@@ isting under the yoke of the Soviet Union .
W@@ age earners , obviously viewed as the force of inertia , will be most appreci@@ ative .
We have defined more broadly than the Commission the legal constructions that these juris@@ dictions will have to show either do not exist on their territory or are fis@@ cally transparent , and I believe that this reversal of the burden of proof is a more effective way of fighting tax evasion .
That will be very interesting . It is not late .
There does not appear to be any good reason for such a delegation of authority , which would also seem to be incompatible with the current statutes of that organization .
Like our other European neighbours , our citizens have found themselves batt@@ ling flames , these disasters resulting in both material damage and human suffering .
in writing . - I am anxious to thank Mr Schwab and the shadow rapporteurs for their work .
I am well aware that the honourable Member has not been able to examine the substance of the proposal , which is why she has questions .
This type of breeding is often carried out by small @-@ sized enterprises , which have been hit hard by the crisis .
For years certain countries , including Great Britain , have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens .
This has been refused until today .
Finally , you are right about the gender dimension .
The Presidency and the Council immediately condemned , in the strongest possible terms , the perpetrators , organisers and sponsors of these barbaric acts .
Public monies should remain in the public sector and should be used for research that is of benefit to the population .
The Council and the governments of the Member States can contribute to this by playing a more active role in ensuring the success of the peace process , especially by using all the means they have available to persuade the Government of Morocco to implement the proposals put forward by the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations in their entirety .
Finally , we proposed the establishment of a programme aimed at promoting exchange of information regarding good practice .
We see banks which , rather than doing their jobs , namely funding the real economy and investment , are building back their margins .
Secondly , at an institutional level , a series of measures should be implemented as quickly as possible , notably the extraordinary European Council meeting in order to debate the consequences of the demographic , family and child protection policies pursued by the various Member States . There should also be regular debate on family affairs and children in the Council of Ministers , and the unit within the European Commission that is devoted to those policies should be restructured .
There should be no competition between agricultural products intended for food and those intended for industry , be they for the production of biofuels or for the agro@@ chemical industry .
The European Union has made a commitment to promoting basic rights and equal opportunities for all .
The five reports submitted to the European Parliament contain several major advances :
It is not acceptable for women to be subjected to bull@@ ying and physical or psychological violence on a daily basis .
Amendment No 8 is politically delicate .
Second , the crisis hits the most vulnerable people the hardest - people like the low @-@ skilled , new entrants or disabled people , who find it difficult to find jobs at the best of times .
Thus , for all those peoples who throughout the world are afflicted by dictatorship , civil war or underdevelopment , Europe represents an immense source of hope for peace , freedom and progress .
Unless we deal with the problem of immigration at source and come up with a large @-@ scale development policy , we shall continue to play host to millions of immigrants who , little by little , will destabilise the Europe we know and finally swam@@ p it .
I have also given notice of my intention to raise this issue , among others , at the Conference of Presidents when we present our written report to it tomorrow morning .
The fact that the report stresses the inter@@ dependency of risk @-@ capital and the stock exchange shows clearly what this is all about : o@@ iling the wheels of capitalism on the pretext of innovation , and creating a preferential status for small companies , which would allow the large groups to out@@ source even more of their activities , reduce their taxes and relax the few constraints that the Labour Code still places on them .
As to the second comment : regarding the non @-@ comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B , I wish to inform you , to confirm , that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects , particularly in favour of small- and medium @-@ sized businesses and of cultural heritage , in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one .
The ALDE Group advocates strict control of pesticides , whilst recognising that their use is both a necessity and a reality .
Madam President , I know that the Commissioner enjoys bet@@ ting on hor@@ ses so he will forgive me for using a sporting meta@@ ph@@ or when I say that he is not exactly a favourite in today &apos; s event .
Sanders @-@ ten Holte recommendation for second reading ( A5 @-@ 03@@ 75 / 2000 )
It will not solve budget problems through cofinancing or by gradually reducing agricultural subsidies , but by providing these policies with the necessary budgetary allocations .
Unfortunately , this principle of mandatory membership did not obtain a majority in the Council of Ministers .
In the conclusions adopted on 21 October , the Council defined the place of the European Employment Strategy in economic governance .
This approach should also be applied , inter alia , to Russia and to Turkmenistan , and to a good many other countries too .
Regarding the cultural cooperation of which you spoke - even though it is not my subject , I am sensitive to what you have said in this regard - in the forthcoming debate on regional policy after 2007 I intend proposing an increase in our appropriations for Interreg and a simplification of that programme &apos; s rules , in order to target cross @-@ border cooperation in transport infrastructures in particular .
As the rapporteur and on behalf of the committee that it is my honour to chair , I call upon the President of the European Parliament to submit these demands to the next European Council and to the future British Presidency .
I wish to thank Mrs Frassoni , Mr Doorn , Mrs McCarthy and Mr Gargani , for whom Mr Lehne is standing in today , for their excellent work and for their reports .
This example of bees is maybe representative of European integration .
This is the case of the new measure for the COM in beef and veal , which is the subject of Mr Sturdy &apos; s excellent report .
This is more important than ever .
I would also like to remind you , referring to page 24 of the Minutes of our meeting of Monday , as approved Tuesday morning , that you yourself proposed not adding a part @-@ session to the 1997 calendar , but adding one to the 1998 calendar .
A duty to revolt for the 34 million people with AIDS , most of whom - over 4 million sufferers - live in South Africa .
Such guidelines represent a step backwards for civilisation , seeking nothing more and nothing less than to convert the provision of all social needs into sal@@ eable commodities , subject to the rationale of profitability .
In my report , I tried to provide answers to these issues and to raise the critical question about the origin of radioactive materials transportation .
Today we can only welcome the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of this harmonization text and I call on all members to approve the draft recommendation presented by Mr Sp@@ al@@ ato Bel@@ ler@@ √© .
It wants harmonisation of the legislation to go no further than is essential for safety and health .
The area in question is a sensitive area in terms of stability and peace and it is also a vast commercial area .
If the Member States do not want to pay a high price , they must find a way to change this situation during the next intergovernmental conference .
Imagin@@ ative measures must be found , which can be adapted to the diversity of the situations in different Member States and which respect the dignity of job seekers .
Nu@@ mer@@ ous people , including US citizens , reject that vision of the world and aspire to globalisation based on solidarity .
Mr President , Commissioner Byrne , the incredibly detailed draft regulation that we are debating this morning is a perfect example of a useless text .
Even so , I would like someone to tell me how appropriations , which cannot be carried forward , can be placed in reserve , since the financial rules of our institutions forbid it .
This is good news . It is clear that rules need to be laid down to regulate the market and that small farms , which have so far been forgotten in successive reforms , need to be helped .
Even though the Union budget is just 1 % of the Community gross domestic product , 16 % of these scant appropriations were unused , in other words , saved .
There are those , like Mr Doorn , who imagine that the Commission does not have to give its opinion on initiatives in this area , because all of that is meant to come under the civil law of the Member States .
The work of the JHA Council on 25 July has allowed a political agreement to be reached on the draft decisions on the European Judicial Network and the strengthening of Eurojust .
I am pleased that Parliament did not accept the suggestion of raising the thresholds referred to in the communication for micro @-@ entities , below which the entities are exempted from the accounting , auditing and dis@@ closure requirements under European law .
The problem which we have discussed fully in the Committee on Agriculture concerns the supervision of animals until their arrival in the third country .
I would reiterate that the Commission proposed , in particular , to reduce the weight and price limits , from 3@@ 50@@ g to 50@@ g and from five to two and a half times the basic standard tariff , to establish special services with high added value which would be open to competition , the gradual liberalisation of outgoing cross @-@ border mail and direct mail , and to set specific deadlines for full liberalisation .
I had no hesitation in voting against this resolution .
That is what led me to ask the question .
It is even more discouraging to see the guarantee fund blocked , because the reduction in the budgetary envelope of Media II was to have been compensated by its creation .
Over and above this apparent dis@@ cord , though , there has been unanimity on one essential point : the EU is well and truly at war and it is going to back up its commitment to join in combat .
It is now up to the Mauritanian authorities to demonstrate , through a liberal attitude , the truth@@ fulness of their statements on this last point .
W@@ ars have always broken out between democracies and totalitarian or fanatical states , and that is what we are witnessing today .
It is up to us to convince our American partners of this .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is an extremely important consumer protection issue .
Once again , Parliament has been asked to validate payment of aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to employees made redundant as a result of the crisis or relocations .
Whether or not we were right beforehand , it is for us to take the most intelligent approach now .
How can Russia and other nations fail to see in all that anything but an aggressive attitude ?
Who can dispute the correctness of such an assessment ?
I think I can say that , now more than ever , we need to show our determination .
Al@@ coh@@ ol consumption , even in small quantities , is harmful to the fo@@ e@@ tus .
I have received a request for urgent procedure , in accordance with Rule 112 of the Rules of Procedure , from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
The problem is deciding on the principles according to which this should take place .
Both instruments should be free @-@ standing remedies additional to those available under national law .
Governments must learn to talk together about their economic policies .
I see myself as a supporter of all those people , as I see myself as a supporter of our Palestinian colleagues who , regardless of parliamentary immunity , have been imprisoned .
I have therefore tabled an amendment which I believe has been taken up by all group coordinators or shadow rapporteurs , thanking the European Investment Bank and noting the details it has provided following our vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
These divergences in the appreciation of the parties who will have to pronounce themselves on the IGC are not encouraging .
At all events , the European Parliament and the European Commission are firmly resolved to restore consumer confidence .
I should like to remind you that the role of the presidency is to successfully oversee the running of the IGC and not state the positions adopted by the various Member States .
Or will we soon find ourselves in the kind of world depic@@ ted in that excellent film &apos; G@@ atta@@ ca &apos; ?
European civilisation has created diversity in all areas .
We are also required to respect the confidentiality of preparatory inquiries and the right to privacy of individuals and officials under investigation .
The testing is not systematic or is limited to sick animals or dead @-@ on @-@ farm animals , and so we are in no way giving the impression of adopting a quasi @-@ systematic , and hence reliable , approach with regard to meat quality and to the epidemiological policy which might be implemented .
Specific proposals can now be implemented .
&apos; Private fo@@ rester @-@ fire@@ fighters &quot; could do this work .
Parliament supports and upholds this step .
Let us not wait for another asbestos @-@ type crisis to make us aware of the dangers that are threatening us .
This is not one of them . You can see for yourselves that the Chamber is far from full .
I shall reply , however , because the comments have occasionally been very excessive .
The United Nations Security Council agreed to the military action aimed at eliminating the terrorist bases where the attacks against the United States in Kenya , in Yemen , in New York and in Washington had been promoted .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission shall promote the general interest of the Union and take appropriate initiatives to that end .
Mr President , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , first of all the Commission would like to endorse the comments made by the President @-@ in @-@ Office , Mr Moscovici , and to welcome the key contribution made by the Members of the European Parliament to the debate and indeed to the Convention , particularly the role played by Mr M√©ndez de Vigo in the Pra@@ esidium of the Convention drafting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
It is in this context that we are going to introduce the euro next year and in subsequent years .
This year , in practice , we are facing the same situation .
The completion of this policy must allow for the enhancement of economic activities at sea and along the coasts , greater account to be taken of employment and also greater environmental protection as well as the development of research and innovation in the maritime sector .
Secondly , we must make proper preparations for the new structural programmes for the period 2000 to 2006 . Finally , we must send a clear message to the applicant countries .
It is to this subject that I should like to return .
As Parliament &apos; s vote must be deemed illegal , the French delegation of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats calls on President Pat Cox to deal with the repercussions of this by immediately annu@@ lling the vote .
The initial text may be poor , the amendment may be good .
in writing . - For twenty @-@ seven countries to have a European budget in the region of EUR 130 billion - that is to say , the equivalent of Spain &apos; s budget , and that alone - is , under normal circumstances , already rather strange .
I am going to leave this Chamber in exactly four minutes to go and negotiate the sale of some new buildings for Parliament .
We must set priority objectives , such as cross @-@ border cooperation in the fight against crime , defence of human rights , democracy , independence of news media and the rule of law , cooperation to resolve conflicts in the region and disarmament ; we must also promote improvements to public health and social development .
There is no single , perfect solution to fit all local circumstances .
However , as I said just now at the start of my speech , these proposals , together with the existing legislation - Mr Cu@@ ta@@ ≈ü mentioned this legislation on credit rating agencies , which should be duly implemented between now and the end of the year , but which will only be fully applicable in December 2010 - do not address all of the issues .
The people of Croatia do not deserve to be ostrac@@ ised in any way .
For the third time we have changed the subject , and on behalf of the Commission and of Mrs de Palacio , for the same reasons as before , I should like to say that we completely approve , Mr Watts , the report that you have presented on the proposal for a Council decision concluding an agreement on maritime transport between the European Community and its Member States and the People &apos; s Republic of China .
We therefore propose setting up a conference involving European , African and Mediterranean countries .
We call for this fund to be implemented as part of the new LIFE + instrument , because we cannot talk constantly about biodiversity within the framework of sustainable development and at the same time dangerously compromise those few financial instruments that make it possible to act to promote biodiversity .
Mr Prodi is visibly trying , by means of desperate measures , to save the Stability and Growth Pact , which has now reached an impasse .
Those Member States have been applying the Schengen rules on external border checks since their accession , and since September 2007 they also carry out checks on persons in the Schengen Information System - SIS .
At the same time , however , it is a matter of regret that the financial resources being earmarked for this project are somewhat lacking .
Both questions were extensively dealt with during the informal Regional Policy Council which was held recently in N@@ am@@ ur on 13 July last .
There is a consensus within the committee that competition rules should be considered to apply without discrimination to all the Member States .
Equal opportunities form part of France &quot; s great republican principles , and I argue for them to be respected at European level in accordance , for example , with the Treaty of Rome institu@@ ting the European Community and with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Yet I do not think our work ends there .
The oil slick of December 1999 demonstrated once again the inadequacy of compensation on offer . Most of the victims have still not been compensated .
With regard to Mrs Be@@ ≈à@@ ov√° &apos; s question about fundamental rights , it is precisely in order to give this new sign of commitment that I decided to create - and I would add that the proposal came from the European Parliament , even though I was already convinced on the matter - the post of commissioner responsible for fundamental rights and individual freedoms . The commissioner will also deal with the issue of minorities , of course , and he or she will be able to report to the Committee on Petitions , which was mentioned here .
In this respect , I believe that Mr S@@ z@@ √°@@ jer , Mr Swoboda , Mrs De Sarnez and all the others are agreed on the need for such increasingly coordinated economic policy .
Following the example of the rapporteur , I believe that there would be a conflict of interests if these companies were directly involved in the joint undertaking , since they would then have to respond to invitations to tender issued by this same company .
The advances for those who protect animals are also significant , not least through the pooling of data derived from animal testing .
The Union must respect this national competence .
It stands to reason that we must agree to all the efforts aimed at imposing the rule of law everywhere and in all circumstances .
I cannot approve this step because it is time to send a clear signal to Turkey by blocking or suspending the implementation of the Customs Union .
We insist on the need to reinforce the system of human rights , in particular by incorporating them into all the activities of the UN system , which would strengthen its capacity to react at any time to breaches of those rights .
It promoted the IMF without considering its transformation .
Nevertheless , it is essential for the managing authorities to take account of the actual situation in the regions and to establish policy areas for the ERDF that truly meet the needs of communities and local economic operators .
C@@ osts may rise , yes , but a rise in staff numbers , no , because if we increase staff@@ ing levels this would put the brake on redeployment measures .
It is a pluralist Commission .
Europe and the European Union could beat the unemployment problem if it changed its basic principles , if it stopped seeking to expand worldwide and if it genuinely embrac@@ ed the principle of subsidiarity and the diversity of regions and nations , in short , if it legisl@@ ated less and imposed fewer conditions upon us .
Where do the Member States stand in this regard ?
The only excuse you have for such an excessive reaction - and this does not correspond with my definition of intellectual honesty - is that you do not , I think , know the Congo very well .
The financi@@ alisation of the agricultural markets is not fundamentally called into question .
Finally , Amendment No 15@@ 5 proposes support for the more vulnerable economic categories , in particular , the small aquaculture plants which must take measures to protect themselves against the pollution which they may cause .
That is why when these countries join the European Union , I shall welcome the workers and the working classes and express the hope that in future struggles to change our lot , we shall be fighting side by side .
Har@@ dly had it prepared the ground for the reunification of Europe when it put in place a process that would completely change its nature , by impro@@ per@@ ly extending its boundaries to encompass a country that is in Asia .
Against the backdrop of international insecurity that is turning our countries upside down and of an economic and social crisis and crisis of identity , this kind of unbelievable proposal demonstrates once again the degree to which these pro @-@ Europeans who want to control everything are out of touch with reality .
So this is simply another stage in the un@@ rel@@ enting globalisation process , which begins with everything at European @-@ level being made uniform .
The European Union has a positive involvement in the restriction and control of arms exports and attempts to add an ethical dimension to the arms trade .
It is un@@ sound , because , currently , national regulation means every man for himself .
We now find ourselves three months away from the deadline of the Nice Summit , and I believe that the issue at stake is that of restoring this confidence .
For example , the Council followed its lead on 27 June 2005 after we had proposed making new trade concessions to Sri Lanka , because the latter had just ratified the ILO &quot; s eight basic conventions .
Europe is exactly the opposite ; that is why you were right to say &apos; Europe needs leadership &quot; , but who wants to be the leader ?
This budgetary dogma is not consistent with the new tasks of the Union , whether they involve enlargement , of course , but also the struggle for employment and keeping up the policies of solidarity .
Today there are a significant number of countries that are embarking on the democratic process .
Let us be quite clear about this , in expressing this view they are once again bringing up the question of whether abortion should be a criminal offence .
So yes , Commissioner , we agree with you .
This regulatory is intolerable and destructive of freedom .
Having achieved unanimity on agriculture , which should be welcomed , the most important question is whether the Council will be able to grasp the opportunity and incorporate Parliament &apos; s position into its plans for the future organisation of the common agricultural policy .
This covers energy , motorways , high @-@ speed rail links , waterways , universities , education , broadband , health , space , and so on .
This training is well developed at national level and , as such , it does not require a European dimension like the other proposed training .
I did , however , vote against the motion as a whole , because it was merely a juxtaposition of view@@ points forming an inconsistent motion .
This is why the Commission wanted to put forward a balanced proposal and why it has outlined 10 key principles so that we can go forward together .
It is the responsibility of these peoples themselves to choose their own destiny in complete freedom and independence .
The issue of concern to us , then , is how we envisage establishing an intergovernmental process which deals with each country individually and which would allow all the States that wish to commit themselves , to actually do so and combine forces , while not forcing any State that does not so desire to take part against their will in a course of action of which it may not approve .
Last time , at the Friday sitting here in Strasbourg , a request of this type had a disastrous effect on the European Parliament &apos; s image .
I call on my fellow Members to think about the consequences of our joint resolution , and to adopt it despite the Socialist Group in the European Parliament &quot; s last @-@ minute u @-@ turn .
It will bolster the dual democratic legitimacy of the Commission through stronger links to the European Parliament and European Council .
I have almost finished on this point .
We are not starting from scratch , far from it .
The hearing we have had with Mrs Tu@@ m@@ pel @-@ Gu@@ ge@@ rell before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs showed that this lady was very competent and certainly capable of maintaining her crucial role on the European Central Bank &apos; s Executive Board .
At the end of a presidency , one should be specific in one &apos; s compliments , but general in one &apos; s regrets .
Should the Council and the Commission not also be considering measures to propose and implement morality in the relationship between producers and consumers on the one hand , and international negotiation and large @-@ scale distribution on the other , for example by fixing a maximum multiplication factor between the production price and the sales price , in the interests of both producers and consumers ?
Therefore , we can only welcome the fact that the Commission , in the spring of 2001 , presented a proposal for a directive to bring in the supervision of financial conglomerates such as these .
Does that mean that nothing can be done at European level ?
I am sure it will hold high the tor@@ ch of the European dream of peace , the European dream of freedom , and the aim of an ever stronger Union .
I will say no more about that ; it is somewhat inevitable in an exercise like a human rights report .
Madam President , arbitrary arrests , death sentences , executions , removal of organs , this is the terrifying scenario which must , with the utmost urgency , cease in China .
I should also like to say that I framed this report taking into consideration what has already been achieved in Parliament , and Parliament &apos; s regard for the Mediterranean question , and at this point I would like to pay special tribute to the work carried out by Mr Y@@ ann@@ is Sakellariou .
I should like , for example , to testify in this House to the excellent work done by the European Parliament &quot; s Marseille @-@ based information office in my region .
Su@@ ff@@ ice it to say that I am one of those who are convinced that no real development can take place - in the sense of creating the sort of wealth that can fund social services , that can fund all the main access channels to public services - in the absence of access to trade and of economic dynamism .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - Mr President , we in the Presidency are very happy to discuss this scheme with the European Parliament , as proposed by the European Commission and brought personally - and I should like to pay tribute to her - by Mrs Fischer Boel .
Finally , this programme leaves many questions unanswered .
This report is fully in keeping with the philosophy of our institution , which has always made its voice heard in the least well off countries , through its opinions , its resolutions or specific action to improve and develop humanitarian aid .
Every time there is a problem , you resolve it in a negative manner .
Through the new cycle of negotiation , what we are preparing is the multilateral organisation of the world markets of the 21st century , with the firm intention of achieving better balance .
That is why we call for a condemnation of Putin .
The aim is to adopt a regulation as soon as possible but , in order to achieve this , the Council must have Parliament &apos; s opinion in due form .
Unfortunately , however , it will not do so without a mass demonstration of solidarity on the part of the people of Europe , appalled by the humiliation , destitution and despair of the Palestinians .
We have two concerns in this respect . The first is that their interests should , of course , be taken into account in negotiating the various trade agreements which we are called upon to sign .
Pop@@ ul@@ ism is how technocrats choose to deni@@ grate the will of the people when it is expressed in a direction which does not suit them .
They must be reimbur@@ sable , with the customs duty paid by the exporter becoming a &apos; tax credit &apos; deductible from purchases from the importer &apos; s economy .
FRONTEX has to take its place in this global approach , which links development and concerted management of migratory flows .
That being the case , the European Parliament must draw a clear distinction between civilian and military crisis management .
We have made it , I believe , thanks first and foremost to the considerable determination of the Members of this House and the fact that they pul@@ led together : I refer particularly to all the parliamentary groups and to the three rapporteurs , who are with us today , but credit also goes to everyone , including the shadow rapporteurs , who did his or her bit .
I understand perfectly well , therefore , that we placed this issue at the head of Monday &apos; s agenda , but I do not think this was what was intended , especially after last week &apos; s vote by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Our objective , therefore , is to seek to maintain a communication channel until our partners have a sufficiently clear picture of the potential results of the negotiations within the WTO .
My last point is to mention the dangers of the militarisation of space .
Mr President , our resolution is very consistent .
One of Greece &apos; s problems is its defence budget .
That is why it declared that it is in the Union &apos; s interest to adopt minimum standards for the protection of victims of crime , specifically with regard to access to justice for these victims and their right to compensation , including the reimbursement of their legal fees .
During the current period of uncertainty about what will happen after 2006 , Parliament &quot; s support for the outermost regions is very valuable .
Mr President , I shall speak for less than thirty seconds .
On the basis of this impact assessment , the next Commission will consult social partners and will come with a comprehensive legislative proposal .
Freedom of the media is essential to the good governance of public or private bodies and contributes to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals of creating a safe , poverty @-@ free world by 2015 .
Our citizens see the national authorities as the most legitimate , and want the main decisions to be taken at national level .
Let us not harbour any illusions . The determination created as a result of that crisis , shared by more than two @-@ thirds of public opinion in the Fifteen Member States of the Union , will not achieve results straightaway .
The programme seeks to highlight the wide diversity of European culture , while at the same time there is the supreme contradiction of pursuing a European policy of economic , social , political and cultural uniformity .
In any case , these were the conclusions that the Ministers for Research and Science reached on this subject at Cap@@ ri last weekend .
Economic policy coordination in the national parliaments must be integrated .
This option is much more suitable and this is the option , Mr President , that we should choose .
I feel it is important to point out that responsible and transparent administration of the European Union is a guarantee of the trust that the citizens place in the European Union .
They have constantly deceived and manipulated the workers of Europe .
We are not concerned in this House with settling diplomatic problems , we are talking about health problems .
I assure you that we shall be talking of this matter for many years to come if we manage to achieve this .
Ultimately , Europe can speak with one voice only if it has nothing to say .
At the price once again of innocent citizens because these events were in fact inevitable .
We should surely have started among the 15 Member States and with the applicant countries by reaffirming , and not just in rhet@@ orical introduc@@ tions , the special values of humanism , solidarity , justice and peace which form the European model , and the objectives of the proposed enlargement .
Once again , the European Union is sur@@ rendering to the dictatorship of the single market , this time in regard to retirement pensions , with the consequences we know so well : even worse inequality between workers , the stranglehold of the financial markets and shareholders on retirement savings schemes , and he@@ avier pension fund pressure on employees .
If not , that would distort competition on our own markets and penalise our own products .
I no longer see any reason to exclude them .
On the basis of the figures for the Objective 1 regions which have been sent to us by Member States , I see that the average wealth per head of population in those countries increased by six points between 1989 and 2001 .
Furthermore , it aims to eliminate discrimination regarding access to assisted reproductive technology - particularly discrimination based on age or sexual orientation - while , at the same time , claiming that we must promote universal access to abortion .
This is merely a first step .
Some have criticised the proposals on Dublin and on reception conditions for being too generous .
In this respect as well , we are counting on you and on your representative , Ambassador Moratinos , to try , against the backdrop of increasingly uncontrolled violent outbreaks , to make the conciliatory voice of Europe heard .
This took intense negotiations and the greatest possible rallying together at all levels , but as of today , the main part has been saved !
Madam President , like the previous speaker , we must congratulate not only Mrs Lambert , the rapporteur , for the work she has carried out , but also , Commissioner , your staff for their work and for the coordination which has developed between the Parliamentary committee and the Commission which has led to the streamlining and updating of a text that concerns one of the fundamental aspects of this European Union of ours , which is the freedom of movement - as you yourself said - not only of workers , but of all Europe &apos; s citizens .
Indeed , many experts believe that the notorious h@@ oc@@ key stick @-@ shaped exponential global warming cur@@ ve is , in reality , a graphi@@ c fabrication .
We must , in my opinion , remain very cautious .
Who will judge the crimes being committed , even as we speak , against civilians in C√¥te d &apos; Ivoire , by rebel soldiers , yes , but also by soldiers of the regime , under the direct protection of the French army ?
In fact , the European Union proposes to open a path for Turkey &apos; s future membership , to launch a European strategy for Turkey which will enable that country to prepare itself for accession - this strategy includes both the European Conference and a substantial strengthening of bilateral relations - and finally , to revive the elements of cooperation already in place , including the financial protocol .
The Turkish Government must include the democratic resolution of the Kurdish problem on its agenda by giving it an appropriate name .
It emphasises that all European States have the right freely to determine their foreign policy and their alliances , and so on . The European Council is pleased that the six @-@ point agreement achieved on 12 August on the basis of the European Union &apos; s mediation efforts has led to a ceasefire , improved delivery of humanitarian aid to the victims and a substantial withdrawal of Russian military forces .
Now , today , we have the perfect opportunity to show that our actions are faithful to our words .
There are some interesting things in her report , but also things which are unacceptable .
It is the duty of those who have made the political choice to introduce the euro , in other words , the most traumatic choice they could inflict on our citizens , resulting in the sudden and total loss of the yardstick by which they establish different values in their everyday lives , to accept full responsibility for the consequences of their decision .
We have come a long way , and I welcome the fact that the Commission has accepted an increase in the services provided to citizens , as each system will have to cover 60 % of the territory of the Union from the start and the whole of the territory at the latest seven years after the launch .
The Channel is a particularly illu@@ min@@ ating example in this respect : a strategic maritime gat@@ eway to the European Union , it is both an essential link between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea ( it contains 20 % of the world &apos; s fleet and more than 500 vessels over 300 tonnes sail through it every day ) and an area dedicated to fishing , leisure activities , aggreg@@ ate extraction and soon - much to my satisfaction - energy production from offshore wind farms .
What is the problem we are facing ?
H@@ ear ! &apos; we say , while awaiting details of an appropriate system of regulation that will avoid any excessive risks without falling into the trap of over@@ regulation .
Therefore , this is not just about the climate and , from that point of view , returning to the 20 % figure is , in our view , far below what is really required .
Consequently , despite these price issues , pigmeat and poultry producers have still been able to export for some time .
The three institutions are in fact committed to respecting the budgetary programme and only the budgetary authorities can implement a modification .
In any case it is clear that such actions must not be funded by public money .
Indeed , at a time when we are entering a new world and facing terrible challenges , those who govern us must realise that this situation is not just discriminatory and unjust , it is not just counterproductive ; it is a daily contradiction of the values we believe in and the model of society that Europe must uphold .
However , we have a couple of reservations about the forthcoming vote .
The first is , of course , the emotion that the House feels in response to the account of what is happening in this part of the world , which concerns us all .
That is all I wanted to say .
If you do not mind , Madam President , I have one last comment .
What I am saying is how much , like Mr Han@@ s@@ enne , we think that a Commission declaration was more necessary than ever , but we also think that it is largely inadequate .
That is what the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection decided on on the basis of my proposal and it is also what we agreed with the Council and the Commission at the end of two trialogues held over recent weeks .
As a result , France has 100 000 fewer dairy cows than it needs to fill its quota and the European Union needs one billion litres of milk to meet European demand .
The progress made in corporate social responsibility ( C@@ SR ) is not yet on a par with the debate on social standards in trade agreements , the subject of the report by Mrs Sa√Øfi .
Nevertheless , Europe will have to check the measures taken by third countries , because how will we explain to our fishermen in Europe that Japanese , Libyan or Tunisian traw@@ ler@@ men are quite legally plundering our stocks of bluefin tuna ?
Therefore , a thorough reform of the regulation is required to guarantee democratic control and to ensure that the measures taken do indeed achieve the desired objectives .
If the Council does not adopt the Statute before July 1999 - which is highly likely , or in any case not unlikely - the transitional Statute which we have adopted will apply from 2004 and the final regime from 2009 .
We cannot be conciliatory towards a discussion partner who is being arrogant .
That can be demonstrated in the context of the Barcelona process .
The idea of combining a residence permit and a work permit is good .
Apart from the serious humanitarian problems which continue to strike innocent populations who have already suffered so much , all ethnic groups and nationalities without distinction , the risk of a regional conflict is now particularly worrying .
It reminded me , in a certain way , given my provenance as an Irish European , of the sham@@ rock , which has three leaves and which represents so much to us .
There will still be just as many lorries , but what is certain is that there will be far more goods on the roads and we shall have failed .
The NA@@ I@@ AD@@ E@@ S programme provides for a range of very different actions : harmonised legislation , strategic promotion and coordination measures .
The Commission and the European Parliament , by means of the Langen report , are supporting this process of &apos; selling off &apos; the methods we use to meet our citizens &apos; basic social needs , and are thus strengthening the domination of markets over our societies .
A number of Member States hoped that all rail services within their territory , whether national or international and irrespective of their providers , would contribute collectively to the financing of public passenger transport services , via the levying of a charge .
This constitutes genuine humiliation , and perhaps this would be enough to inspire our Greek friends to set about fighting to change this situation in their own country .
These rumours and witch @-@ hun@@ ts fuelled by those same authorities have caused enormous harm ; they indicate a lack of responsibility .
Before going any further , I should like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker , and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , and its chairman , on the report before us today , which testifies to the dynamism and great commitment of the European Parliament to the social agenda .
However , of these nine Member States , three will not be affected - the United Kingdom , Ireland and Denmark - because they are not participating in this directive .
It is a necessary condition for entren@@ ching job @-@ creating growth .
In Amendment No 7 , the same group noted that Parliament had withdrawn a complaint on the financial claims and it wanted to know the consequences of this .
Moreover , if we wish , we can even include the International Monetary Fund in this framework , but always in accordance with European rules .
Accordingly , improved governance and better implementation of the law will lead to more sustainable forest management .
This is not in the interests of peace , nor is it in the interests of the Israeli people .
Do not disappoint them !
There is another fact that merits our attention : the presence , in a country with less than two million inhabitants , of over fifty thousand w@@ es@@ tern@@ ers with a standard of living 10 , 15 , 20 times higher than that of the Kosovars , cannot but present many problems in terms of discrimination and inequality , and is not without secondary effects that are not always as secondary as all that , and are in fact very serious and often very problematic , or even truly adverse .
That example should be followed and we need a framework directive to achieve that .
Secondly , contrary to what Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten has said , there has not been any confusion .
Moreover , the report recommends the harmonisation of financial regulations to introduce greater responsibility on the issue at global level .
This drive to find peace is a source of great hope for thousands of families that have been separated for half a century .
The European Parliament also assumes that the ECB President will explain the decisions taken by his Council when he appears before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and , indeed , during plenary debates .
Every time one of the groups can be reli@@ ed upon to say , &quot; Yes , it is important , but you must see that Mr Ben Ali is still just settling in . &quot;
The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - which are still not officially available , four days later - is a good illustration of the difficulty in clearly drawing up decisions taken in a state of confusion .
The European Commission has also released EUR 2 million for Mali , EUR 4.@@ 6 million for Eritrea and EUR 4.5 million for Ethiopia , countries that have also been affected by food and nutrition crisis situations .
It is a question of giving European purch@@ as@@ ers a sound , clear legal basis for dealing with bi@@ ds from enterprises from a country with which we have an agreement differently than with those from a country with which the EU does not yet have an agreement , and of providing greater legal certainty .
The UPE Group is therefore calling for an appropriate response from the European Union .
Amendment No 7 , on the other hand , cannot be accepted , because the aim here is not development cooperation , and nor can Amendment No 78 , since the programme cannot provide students from third countries with support relating to their return to their home country .
Nor do I think it acceptable that the European Union should fail to respond to the murders of journalists covering the war in Chechnya .
By and large , we have two stand@@ points , that of the Council which persists in wishing to fund the new requirements of Kosovo and Serbia from the budget total established in Berlin without revision , and that of the Commission which is proposing to revise the financial perspective in order to finance these new requirements without seriously affecting the other policies , particularly the MEDA programme .
It is time for the European Union to insist strongly that human rights and international law be respected in the Middle East .
Be that as it may , the system has produced positive results ; for example , the latest definitive figures available show that , between 2000 and 2002 , our imports under this system gre@@ w from EUR 47 billion to EUR 53 billion , which is a significant growth , especially as certain products were removed from the GSP list for technical reasons .
They are also , however , the victims of traffickers , of criminal gangs who financially exploit their despair .
Finally , the report suggests that the Commission should draw up an action plan or other system for a market @-@ based instrument for the environment .
So that I can ensure that I am understood correctly , I shall continue in English .
The number of cooper@@ atives concerned in Europe is anything but negligible .
The European Union , obsessed by its own interests , has also revised CAP reform downwards .
Many of these countries are still batt@@ ling with excessively high costs and I believe that a long transitional period , which I would insist on , is very important for these countries .
Why are we committed to retaining a Community development policy ?
And even though it took that horror , I am glad to say that in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs we achieved - as I hope we will do in this House - unanimous agreement on all the measures designed to combat this scourge .
I think we can be proud of it .
It is true that , like other developing countries , the Burmese authorities are faced with considerable challenges - guaranteeing national unity , political stability , speeding up the country &apos; s economic and social development - but that does not prevent the establishment of a legitimate civilian government .
This Constitution is an important , essential and indispensable staging post , but it is still only a staging post .
Common binding standards on the quality and safety of donations in the 27 Member States absolutely must be adopted in order to improve cross @-@ border exchanges and to increase donation rates .
Since 2007 , three nuclear power plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria have been decomm@@ ission@@ ed with substantial financial support from the EU .
Yes , the Commission welcomes Parliament &quot; s reintroduction of this provision into the draft , because we believe that a harmonised approach to verification requires a common definition of what constitutes a serious infringement .
Mr President , as we know , this is the week in which most of our Member States are launching the first wave of influenza A vaccinations whilst , at the same time , we are forced to recognise the meagre progress made in this area in terms of access to the vaccine by developing countries .
The funds allocated to structural measures are badly used or are under@@ used and confirm the shortcomings and the defects of this policy manag@@ ed@@ by Brussels .
It is the only one in a position to go beyond certain dogmatic conflicts .
Mr President , this debate is concerned with questions that are essential to humanity , such as what is life and how can we halt that inel@@ uc@@ table march towards death which is a characteristic of any existence ?
The Commission presented them at the end of April 2005 .
It was always the real economy that paid the price for this financial instability .
That is the direction taken by our amendments on the matter , even though , legally , we will need to discuss it during the trialogue .
Finally , one thing is clear .
Despite the European Parliament &apos; s efforts , when consulted on this text , to give it greater force , the framework decision lacks ambition and will not be enough to tackle the problems we face : combating racism and ensuring that our universal values are shared .
The positions adopted by the French Presidency , which we have heard elsewhere , which would water down the Commission proposals even further , such as amending the proportion of ships targeted with the aim of reducing inspections by half , are naturally unacceptable .
It is natural to combat the misappropriation of funds , which is sometimes practised even at the highest levels of government in certain countries .
Member States &apos; obligations to introduce criminal penalties in application of the Directive therefore extend to unlawful behaviour in breach of the provisions of legislation adopted on the basis of the Euratom Treaty , and they must be determined with reference to that legislation . &apos;
- This report is a typical example of the type of debate which preclu@@ des political consensus .
Parliament was quite right to underline the difficulties that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises have in accessing this programme , and the new text will quite specifically make it easier for them .
We must never lose hope .
It is important that this should not be seen as a purely formal exercise and that the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council confines himself to collecting the ess@@ ays handed in by individual pupils in the class of Europe and leaves the teacher to allocate the good and bad marks .
The compromise found with the Member States will allow the Commission to present a report on the requirements for minors travelling alone across external borders .
Like a team , every member is vital to success : the Council , the Commission and Parliament all have an important role to play in meeting our common European ambitions at the service of Europe &apos; s citizens .
It seeks to make European higher education more attractive throughout the world and also here , in Europe ; it seeks to enhance its quality , thanks to the European Masters &quot; courses , which will link several universities from different countries on our continent and which will be open to students and academ@@ ics initially from here at home and later from the whole world , on the basis of the award of scholarships .
It is our duty not only to express our solidarity but also to play an active part in the reconstruction of the parts of the island that have been devastated .
We can no longer stand by id@@ ly and let things happen .
Every nation inher@@ its from its anc@@ estors a civilisation that it must preserve .
I think it is a mistake to introduce worker participation at such a level , in other words in such small companies .
To sum up , Mr President , although pharmaceutical companies have , by and large , been backed up in the Commission &apos; s initial proposals , we have a duty - and this must be the mission of the European Parliament - to protect the interests of citizens , patients and consumers .
That is the trap he is setting for us , and all we can do is say to both sides , &apos; Cal@@ m down ! &apos;
The multiannual action plan that was devised following the identification of the agency &apos; s management problems lacks clarity , and the monitoring report fails to give us a proper understanding of the measures put in place .
The progress achieved at Camp David needs to be consolidated and final concessions are necessary , especially on the question of Jerusalem , refugees and , above all , the Holy Places .
Madam President , Basel III is supposed to be a starting point and under no circumstances must it be the furthest that the European Union is willing to go .
It was in this spirit that I proposed the idea of making our own institution act as a catalyst : it could decide to hold its Conference of Presidents in East Jerusalem with the aim of sending a real message of peace to all of the key figures there .
Secondly , and still with regard to relations with Russia , let us be quite clear : in the negotiation mandate that we presented to the Council regarding our relations with that country , the first point on the list is not energy , or even trade - no , the first point relates to human rights , respect for democracy and respect for the rule of law .
We are aware that international trade is developing at twice the speed of gross world product .
Mr President , I voted for Mrs Kratsa @-@ Tsagaropoulou &apos; s report , which concerns women in Mediterranean countries , too .
Lille in 2004 gives us a perfect and remarkable illustration of this being done .
I will not mention them all in my two minutes .
Equal pay for equal work , certainly , but the key issue is the reference point .
Mr President , once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive , and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague , Bern@@ d Lange .
Yes , freedom for Gilad Shalit , but also for Sal@@ ah Ham@@ ouri !
Such initiatives show that the mobilisation of the international community is strengthening , and it must not sl@@ ac@@ ken .
From a totally embryonic stage in 1999 - I would remind you that the ambition of the Tampere programme was firstly to lay the foundations of cooperation between the Member States and to promote mutual recognition of judicial decisions - the J@@ L@@ S sector under@@ went further growth during the Hague programme , which strengthened the Community platform .
Finally , I believe that the only way out of the present situation is to combine infringement procedures with the financial measures which will make it possible to remove fundamental obstacles and , above all , allow democracy to make a greater contribution .
Let me make three comments to illustrate the legitimacy of this objective .
Employment is the benchmark in reducing poverty .
It therefore demands for it to be increased - by at least 5 % in the first instance .
S@@ pending is becoming an end in itself and the measure of the programme &apos; s success .
It is the Romanian people who have today won their freedom and their right to join us .
The reality for MEPs is indeed complex in many respects .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , Minister , you are asking for our support for your proposals on human rights .
Indeed , it is your duty to ensure that the general public is well informed .
A@@ ware of the negative consequences of the fair act for their agriculture , the United States have replaced it with an ambitious farm bill bringing in a 70 % increase in financial support to the sector . In contrast , the European Union has set ceilings for expenditure on agriculture .
The measures proposed to mitigate the effects of this reform are temporary and as such merely palli@@ atives designed solely to win acceptance for a reform the effects of which may ultimately be disastrous .
Nevertheless - and you are right in this regard - it is clear that , in recent months , some worrying trends have unfortunately developed with regard , in particular , to religious freedom and to freedom of expression . These trends are illustrated more specifically by the harassment of the Catholic community in Han@@ oi and by the sent@@ encing , last week , of journalists for their investigation into corruption .
Quite obviously , this is not France &apos; s ambition .
Thus I ask you , in your capacity as the European Parliament , to set an example and respect minorities .
I shall refer to paragraphs 26 and 27 of Mr Elles &apos; s motion for a resolution on the 1996 discharge .
Madam President , we are very glad that the customs union agreement with Turkey has been suspended .
The Fo@@ ot@@ ball League never discussed the matter with UEFA and yet I believe that , in a democracy , which is also called upon to play a role within our sporting federations , discussions between the main parties should be the order of the day .
The global prudential rules were not suited to real @-@ life conditions .
We support the call for a detailed charter of patients &quot; rights , designed to bring about a high @-@ quality health system in the short , medium and long term , based on solidarity .
- The Schmitt report is aimed at establishing greater control of cash movements equal to , or above , EUR 15 000 , which is the lower limit in force in European financial institutions .
First , training is a critical requirement of SMEs .
These phenomena are made worse by an ill thought @-@ out enlargement that will penalise the current Member States without meeting the needs of the new Member States .
There can be no question of this Parliament condemning Member States which decide not to do so .
If it is compulsory to use the European logo ( for foodstuffs containing 95 % organic ingredients ) and the &apos; EU @-@ organic &apos; indication , then it must remain possible to add other private lo@@ gos .
It is clear that the progress that has been made these last few years on defining and guaranteeing a universal service in the postal sector , as in other areas , such as energy , constitutes a significant advance which we found it very hard to conceive of or even hope for at the beginning of the n@@ ine@@ ties .
That was not the purpose of the euro .
Allow me to dig@@ ress a little .
The record of abstention beaten at every single European election should serve to remind us that the supranational level is not that of a fair and effective democracy .
Mr President , the highly predictable military victory of the US and UK forces in Iraq has generated among some people a sort of ad hoc opportun@@ ism : let us forget all about past quar@@ rels and let us build a democratic Iraq under the expert leadership of the US .
I certainly prefer political dialogue to unilateral sanctions , but , for this very reason , it is our duty to tell our partners that we are extremely concerned about the situation in Tunisia .
Since then , we have observed everywhere - including in the Gulf - powerful demonstrations , which are taking place to ask for greater respect of human rights , fundamental freedoms and democracy .
On this point , however , the Commission was not in agreement with the assistants .
Obviously there must be a broad consensus between Parliament , the Council and the Commission on the need to reduce the environmental and energy impacts of transport .
Fortunately , Member States , and in particular France , have used the powers of initiative which they still pos@@ ses , until 1 May 2004 , to put forward other proposals which are more precise , better targeted , and therefore more effective . There is a proposed framework decision aimed at reinforcing the penal code to stop the facilitation of unauthorised entry into and residence in the Union , a draft directive which seeks to improve the definition of &apos; facilitation of unauthorised entry , movement and residence &apos; , and a draft directive on hauliers &apos; liability if they carry illegal immigrants .
We have therefore voted against the Zappal√† report .
The ILO is working on this and genuine synergy might be developed here .
Greater internal autonomy could be given to the regions which have an Albanian majority .
This amendment will allow internalisation of external costs in another sector , railways .
Therefore we cannot , unfortunately , expect good news from Cancun on this point .
Yes , that is clear and is precisely the idea of the &quot; Innovation 2000 &quot; initiative that the European Investment Bank put forward at the Lisbon Summit .
I do not want Members to be exempt from all monitoring or not to be subjected to any sort of questioning regarding their activities including their activities as a Member of Parliament in the execution of their mandate , but I am afraid that this agreement may allow some uncertainty to remain and may entail precisely this parallel nature of the roles if we proceed in an over @-@ hasty way , just like the events of recent months , and do not take a step back .
So they decided to wait and I would like that point clarified .
With this vote , I want to show the considerable progress that Turkey must make in order to join the European Union , but , in doing so , I do not want to create any further obstacles to its possible accession .
This is the very spirit of the Treaty and the essence of history .
And you have also fought to ensure the EU moves forward , and it is increasingly accepted that it should be equipped with the constituent process used in each of our countries , that is to say , a debate that is open and democratic .
Let us be realistic : we are facing a crisis of which we urgently need to correct the effects , but also learn the long @-@ term lessons .
I think that just asking the question is an answer in itself .
I have not said that I am indulging in blind optimism .
The WTO negotiations have no direct or indirect connection with the decisions on privatisation that particular States might take .
Finally , because it directly called upon the Egyptian authorities to intervene , thereby running the risk of things getting out of hand .
The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy , progress in terms of research and development , education and training , external aid in the fields of development and cooperation , transnational infrastructure projects , and sufficient Structural Funds and a sufficient Cohesion Fund to demonstrate the necessary solidarity with the new countries : all of that will only be achieved to a minimal extent .
We therefore note that a step has been taken in the right direction .
Since we have no ratification power , you could say that after all you will not take it into account .
Madam President , when horror reaches such a degree , reason often fails to accompany our actions .
It would , therefore , be a matter of bringing together a convention that would be composed of Members of the European Parliament , members of national parliaments , members of the Commission and members of the governments of Member States .
As regards the choice of headquarters , I hope it will be as operational as possible and that we will avoid fruit@@ less arguments .
Finally comes the third objective : to include the European Parliament in every stage of the process .
The Council was very aware of the discussions that had taken place in Parliament and was careful to follow the approach adopted in the Council of Europe .
I note that during the course of the most turbu@@ lent weekend of the last few weeks , the word &apos; systemic &apos; was ut@@ tered several times .
Our Assembly will therefore need to use all its influence to enhance the Union &apos; s institutional equilibrium , and this in several directions .
It concerns the daily lives of millions of citizens who , in future , will not be able to count on having a un@@ interrupted gas and electricity supply , which are some of the public services that each State , and now Europe , made a commitment to provide .
If the directives on the labelling of food products were applied throughout the Union in such a way as to indicate the region of breeding and slaughter , consumers would be able to decide in a more informed way whether or not to buy this product .
Your rapporteur would prefer to wait for this more general revision .
As regards the additional concessions requested by Mr Cappato , it is precisely the negotiations conducted by the Commission that must make it possible to see - and the Commissioner has emphasised this point - whether progress has been made by the Vietnamese authorities in this area .
Greece does not have to beg to be allowed into the euro zone ; it is fully qualified to join the States that will introduce the euro as an effective and definitive means of payment in 2002 .
Mr President , Mrs P√©ry &apos; s report analyses the different factors in the long @-@ term crisis afflicting the Community fishing industry .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the transition from the GATT era to that of the WTO changed the dimension as well as the nature of the multilateral trading system .
. - Mr President , of all the pe@@ remp@@ tory judgments expressed so far with regard to the car@@ to@@ ons of Mohammed , there are few I find very convincing .
Both represent a part of the real Europe .
The &apos; Small Business Act &apos; is aimed at increasing entrepreneurship in Europe and helping businesses grow .
In the Gulf of Mexico , at Cancun , on 14 September , if it says no it will be an agricultural and tropical Munich , but then Europe is female and lo@@ ves to be dominated .
Worse still , the new sentences that the country has just passed against Leyla Zana and that threaten many leading members of H@@ ADEP , show that those leaders are locked into a repressive and military strategy from which there is no escape .
I have identified three particularly characteristic points .
Firstly , the Commission , Member States and their organisations must provide consumers with information upstream .
True , it does not work when the need is not felt or when one of the parties makes exorbitant or over @-@ constra@@ ining claims on other partners , but must we b@@ emo@@ an this fact ?
Finally , with reference to the precautionary principle , I think that carcinogenic , muta@@ genic and re@@ produc@@ tively toxic substances , classed in categories 1 , 2 and 3 depending on their risk potential , should be banned from use in cosmetics .
In addition , we need to have a solid knowledge base in order to put in place a permanent strategy for combating counterfeiting and piracy .
It always has a high social cost , particularly in regions housing traditional industries in which employees who are poorly qualified and not particularly mobile have difficulty in changing occupation .
As the representative of the people of the European Union , our Parliament must take a very careful look at the contents of this document .
We should therefore clarify and re@@ fine the Commission &apos; s text , which is what Mrs Grosset√™te tried to do , rather than delete everything .
This financing is , in fact , causing a problem .
I , personally , could list all of the points that bother me and those with which I disagree .
The very first thing that must be done therefore is to ascertain whether the Directive provides the appropriate regulatory framework for the coming years or whether it needs to be adjusted , and this will be verified in the communication .
It has to be said that despite the will shown regularly by over two @-@ thirds of our fellow European citizens , as you said , some progress has been made over ten years , I will grant you that , but it has to be said also that this Europe still does not exist .
I have looked everywhere , but I have not yet found any measures that respond to the expectations of the citizens .
T@@ ests will also be carried out on a random basis on cattle entering the food chain .
Thus the impact on growth in the euro zone will be less marked than before , even though the country @-@ by @-@ country results will reveal some big differences .
At that time I was the youngest Member of Parliament and , including me , there were only two women Members .
In that context , rejection is a message directed at the European Patent Office .
Ex@@ port restrictions have only strengthened the spiralling increase in prices to the detriment of already fragile countries .
You have done so by declaring that a decision like this would be taken by the European Council , which must take it unanimously .
This return will result in France taking on heavy obligations .
The report by Mrs Pol@@ fer comes just at the right time because , with the events in Georgia , we can see fir@@ s@@ th@@ and the difficulties of building democracy .
We are not even capable of agreeing on the name of this country , and I am pleased to be speaking before the Greek Foreign Minister .
But the President of the World Bank told us that in human terms , in terms of unemployment and in terms of an increase in poverty , there will also be catastrophic results .
Did I read &apos; partners &apos; ?
Iraq is the only Arab country where there are Christians , churches and Christmas trees , and where the presents being given to children are bombs , an embargo , thousands of dying children , genocide , and a concentration camp for 18 million Arabs which is guar@@ ded by the West .
We want to maintain an element of coherence .
Mr President , thank you for having agreed to put our proposals to the vote .
For the first time , it was clear that we would refuse to grant discharge when , on 17 December , we rejected a motion in favour of granting discharge tabled by the Socialist Group which had been adopted in extrem@@ is by a very small majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
The Commission is the guardian of the treaties , as you reminded us in the Committee on Institutional Affairs , and you also recalled also that it was guardian of the general interest .
To my great regret , the Council has rejected some of the most important amendments .
Personally , I do not see how we can address the subject and tackle this question without agreeing on that precondition , just as we agree on access to school , access to work and access to micro @-@ credit .
On the other hand , however , maximum harmonisation would leave no room for diversity and would , therefore , also cause a problem .
For all these reasons , the euro is a powerful factor in our integration .
I am speaking for myself , but we are holding a parliamentary debate and I believe for Parliament to confuse its monitoring task with a governing task , which is incompatible with its role , would detract from its fundamental task .
That is why , having carried out all this work to explain the situation , I do not agree with the term &apos; negligence &apos; that Mr Sepp√§nen used earlier .
I think that the least we can expect is tolerance , and failing that then at least respect .
However , the fight against terrorism presupposes a state of permanent mobilisation , and it is probably because we have rather lost sight of this idea and this obvious fact that we are now confronted with the tragic situation we see in the United States .
No , not all the attacks on the freedom of the press are the same .
In fact , it was important to legislate on such a sensitive subject and , similarly , to do all within our power to remove the final restrictions on freedom of movement .
The consensus defines these principles for action , on which our institution &apos; s humanitarian action is based .
This report argues that political parties at European level must be the place for &apos; expressing the will of the citizens of the Union &apos; .
The debate that has opened as a result of the Dover tragedy has focused on the traffic in human beings and the eradication of the mafias that organise the criminal networks .
Here again , we can see that the Union , the Commission and the Member States , too , especially some States such as Italy , have been working on numerous projects but have achieved little .
At a later date , managers of funds located outside the European Union will be subjected to the same rules as those applying to European funds .
The European Parliament has been saying this for two years .
I am not a fat@@ alist .
I will begin with the issue of bonuses , which was the last question .
I must talk about the regrets concerning the composition of the tri@@ o heading the Convention .
As I explained in the minority opinion attached to the report , the I @-@ ED@@ N Group considers that such a development would be dangerous and that the Council must continue in its role as a central decision @-@ maker , representing the Member States , and as the hier@@ arch@@ ical superior of the Commission .
So , to ensure that European consumers can still aspire to the legitimate choice of natural foodstuffs , the least the European Union can do for now is to support biological production consistently .
The Commission must therefore abide by its undertaking to find additional funds for the Alliance .
Lik@@ ening &apos; partially separated waste &apos; to &apos; un@@ treated mixed municipal waste &apos; , as Amendment No 14 does , risks affecting the development of the waste sorting sectors which we are trying to establish and in which some or all of the residues could be co @-@ incin@@ erated .
How is it possible that the euro zone is only a single payment area for notes and coins , with all other means of payment being discouraged by punitive bank charges ?
We take note of this comment .
Madam President , Commissioner , what I have to say has been said many times over by my fellow Members .
Our committee highlights the need for changes in the law to allow the CFP to be applied differently in these regions that are very remote from the European continent . It must be adapted to the opportunities for development offered by their maritime areas that have a strong fisheries potential .
It is all really rather extraordinary .
I must therefore ask , as you did , Commissioner , that we know exactly who these NGOs are , what their purpose is and how they are funded before we hold another conference .
We are currently working on the preparation of this document .
The first , which you have already mentioned , is the issue of the Middle East .
It is not by chance that the Declaration of Human Rights coin@@ ci@@ ded in France with the affirmation of national sovereignty .
in writing . - I voted for the legislative resolution based on the report by Portuguese Member Ar@@ man@@ do Fran√ßa supporting the initiative by a number of Member States ( the Republic of Slovenia , the French Republic , the Czech Republic , the Kingdom of Sweden , the Slovak Republic , the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany ) to amend a series of framework decisions ( 2002 / 5@@ 84 / JHA on the European arrest warrant , 2005 / 2@@ 14 / JHA on the mutual recognition of financial penalties , 2006 / 7@@ 83 / JHA on the principle of mutual recognition of confiscation orders , and 2008 . / ... / JHA on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters ) in order to make provision for the enforcement of decisions rendered in abs@@ entia .
I voted against the resolution on the EU 2020 strategy because paragraph 6 , which mentions the restructuring of social security systems and talks about greater flexibility for workers , has been adopted .
Pro@@ ductions which , although they do not actually feature children , may suggest or intend to suggest that children are involved are also covered by the definition of offence .
Many of the parties represented here in Parliament form part of governments that are pursuing this policy of conciliation and support .
I hope , Mr Kyprianou , that you will be able to convey the concerns of this House to the Commissioner responsible , Mr McCreevy , and that , once the conclusions of the study are on the table , these concerns will be firmly established in people &apos; s minds so that we can hold a responsible and effective debate on this issue .
In this respect , the rigidity of the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact seems to run counter to the fundamentals of good governance .
This vote will also help in that regard .
We are going to create a European passport for pension funds .
That is why I am saying that reconstruction is a good thing .
I had stated that yesterday &apos; s conduct was exceptional , due to the exceptional situation in which we found ourselves , since the voting time was divided in two to allow for the speech by the President of Portugal .
If the fisheries industry is to become more competitive , it will depend on the sector &apos; s ability to adapt in order to face up to the constraints imposed by both the state of its resources and by commercial demand .
After long weeks of informal negotiations which were , unfortunately , un@@ successful - Mr Medina reminded us earlier that this dossier has been pending since 1993 - we are now faced by a most un@@ comfortable alternative .
Better cooperation with American and Japanese research authorities is absolutely vital .
As for financial support from Europe for artistic training , there is no specific programme , but our education programmes support such training and we are seeing some encouraging signs .
We would find it regrettable to depart from a harmonised formula when horizontal discussion is conducted within the interinstitutional group on agencies , in which Parliament participates .
What had to be avoided at all costs was for sanctions or compensation to be so high that they cause airlines not to take major technical incidents quite so seriously , in other words , using safety to offset the costs of denied boarding .
I also launched a public debate before making proposals on the CAP post @-@ 2013 reform .
Only a small minority of states had supported that version .
This is a particularly daring role reversal .
Too much violence , not enough talks , and a Palestinian state much reduced in size into the bargain .
What can we do to move Europe forward ?
For 39 years we have been legislating : on the shock of the arrival of Spain in 1986 , and of Denmark in 1993 , on g@@ ill@@ nets , dri@@ ft@@ nets , fishery agents , total allow@@ able catches , quotas , aid , fleet restructuring , and modernisation .
Sometimes it is necessary to kick up a fu@@ ss , to abandon the politics of peace and quiet and , at long last , provide an answer to the real problems of our citizens .
It is true that there is one question that is constantly raised , namely the International Criminal Tribunal and Serbia &apos; s cooperation with it .
I would say to you once again : the Directorate @-@ General for Transport has handled 5 6@@ 23 letters , which means that we can already identify certain trends .
The principal commitments made by the donors are as follows : better planning , three to five years in advance , of the aid countries hope to provide ; the use of administrations and organisations in partner countries ; swit@@ ching from political conditions imposed by third countries to conditions based on targets set by the developing countries themselves .
I also support the idea of a one @-@ stop shop introduced in the form of a joint body established by the management board of each freight corridor , offering applicants the opportunity to request a slot crossing at least one border in a single place and in a single operation .
I would like to come back to three points very briefly .
In the steel and alu@@ mini@@ um sectors and other energy @-@ intensive industries operating in a global market , on@@ costs will not be reflected in prices , but will certainly affect the only adjustment variable remaining : employment .
When we saw you last December , you told us that you were basically expecting 3 % inflation in 2008 and then things would calm down .
We must therefore be firm and clear on three points . We must work out whether the allocation of sums to large companies will result , above all else , in guaranteeing the permanence of jobs .
My group seeks to adapt this funding to the new realities of Europe , both in its objectives and its terms of reference .
The Barcelona Agreement signed by 27 countries , those of the European Union plus the 12 countries of the southern Mediterranean : Algeria , Cyprus , Egypt , Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , Malta , Morocco , the Palestinian Authority , Syria , Tunisia and Turkey .
Why does the European Union not support a series of financial commitments , which would enable interest rates to be reduced and which is an objective on which a consensus has been reached within the European Parliament ?
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them , while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups .
Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases , specifically restricted to organised crime , terrorism and drug trafficking .
We also adopted a report on the trafficking of human beings and another on the European protection order ; the rights of victims in other words .
As for the others , they will join us when they realise that this is the future .
There is a certain Head of State , and I heard him talk on the television one day , a European Head of State who said that he would take a k@@ ni@@ fe to the terrorists and do for every last one of them .
Parliament has also secured the removal of the division of the &apos; eye irritation &apos; category into sub @-@ categories , which would undoubtedly have led to an increase in the number of tests on animals without adding any real value .
Pre@@ v@@ ented from leaving their country of birth , intercep@@ ted at sea , unofficial channels , detention , rescue or dro@@ w@@ ning - and I would like to hear you say and say again that rescu@@ ing people at sea is a universal and fundamental duty , witness the case of the seven Tunisian fishermen , and that it is the very minimum that we should expect - and then possibly forced repatriation , endless wan@@ dering in hostile transit countries , plus serious violations of human rights and so on .
I can tell you that the MEPs were working until 2 a.m. last night and again this morning , and have reached an agreement on the CO2 emissions of cars .
These need to be carried out regularly .
Should we conclude that we have no prospect of success ?
We do not do this enough , that is true , even though , in my opinion , a great deal of progress has been made in this area .
The French army , for example , has not needed to defend its country since 1945 .
There is the general debate on which we all agree , and there is the immediate issue .
I am also thinking , obviously , of the problem of the institutionalised discrimination against the Kurdish people .
We are currently watching the sector become increasingly concentrated , to the point that the much lau@@ ded competition that you b@@ end our ears about is on the verge of becoming a monopolis@@ ation of the energy market by a handful of multinational companies .
Consequently , I would be grateful if you could also explain the next steps to us .
Currently , the Member States still create too many obstacles for this cooperation to operate satisfactorily and to be effective .
I also want to express our gratitude for the work done by the Temporary Committee on Policy Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es and Budgetary Me@@ ans of the Union , which you chaired , Mr President .
I also wished to draw attention to the financial resources to be put at the regulator &apos; s disposal .
The Council hopes to convert this priority into figures with a total appropriation 30 % higher than in 2000 .
Most of these installations have now been shut down and have become obsolete , and they have been maintained in a secure state pending decommissioning .
Madam President , I want to say something about Nigeria , where the murder of Mrs A@@ bio@@ la has dark@@ ened what was already a mur@@ ky political situation .
The set pension fund strategy essentially aims to drain savings away to@@ ward the financial markets .
That is why we will be supporting the proposal to reject the directive .
Another thing that concerns me is how this legislation will be put into practice by SMEs .
Second , the achievement of this aim undoubtedly involves opening up the markets to competition , the process of liberalisation and division into separate activities relating to energy transmission , production and distribution .
The action plan emphasises the notions of subsidiarity and of dynamic inter@@ play between the various actors in the Northern Dimension .
Having said that , it is the sixth &apos; no &apos; in nine referendums since the fall of the Berlin Wall .
We therefore need to take action quickly so that their qualifications are recognised .
To conclude , we would signal our commitment to respect for minorities , which is an indispensable basis for the peaceful settlement of these conflicts in Africa .
Now we shall proceed to the same vote on Mr Haarder .
.@@ Bi@@ zar@@ rely , a crucial aspect of the affair of our colleague , Mr Gollnisch , which was nonetheless present in the first three drafts of Mrs Wallis &quot; report , has disappeared in the final version .
The adaptation of our economies to the requirements of the single currency is a good example of that .
He was an old anti @-@ fascist militant , an old federalist , and I pay tribute to those Members of Parliament who voted for this draft during the sitting of 14 February 1984 .
That is not coordination , which is the coordination that should enable the maximum benefit to be derived from the euro zone .
Their purpose is to facilitate the provision of services across Europe .
Since excessive regulation cannot be a solution , the delegation has defended the amendment rejecting the Commission &apos; s proposal , as existing texts on this issue have not yet been applied in some Member States that are subject to infringement procedures .
If we are to make our policies more coherent , we must involve our partners .
We know now that the epidemic can only be overcome through long @-@ term commitment .
I would like to put the following question : is the weakening of our common currency solely due to the Greek crisis , or is the euro the target of direct attacks by those who are unhappy about its power and that of the Member States involved ?
This is therefore clearly one of the great responsibilities of Member States .
This is what the people of Pan@@ sh@@ ir are now expecting .
In as much as I too am the rapporteur for one of the reports on the Telecom package , I think it is important for Europe to make arrangements and propose to us programmes for ....
This House consu@@ mes 200 000 tonnes of CO2 each year .
There is , however , something strange in all of this : how did the idea of holding two separate debates instead of one joint debate come about in our agenda ?
I would remind you , as has already been mentioned , of the aim of this directive , which is road safety .
It will simply be a question of political will .
This question is entirely rhet@@ orical .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like , first of all , to join with all the others who have just spoken in congratulating Mr Parish on the work he has done and to say to you that I am completely in agreement with the objectives set out in this report .
Generally , where the developing countries are concerned , six years on from the creation of the WTO , the picture before us reveals a limited opening up of markets in the north , considerable difficulties in implementing agreements and persistent marginalisation from the workings of the WTO .
Clearly , we would like there to be less per@@ nick@@ ety bureaucracy and we would like to give business a bit of air .
Further progress is needed on debt cancellation , but a premium on democracy must be introduced and new sources of finance urgently sought : taxes on the movement of capital , on the arms trade , on CO2 emissions , it does not matter , all manner of things have been put forward .
Europe must ham@@ mer home this message tirelessly .
Beyond this specific case , should we not be working to impose the pre @-@ eminence of the precautionary principle over all other considerations in trade , both within the EU and with third countries ?
At a time when the Constitutional Treaty is dead and buried , following the &apos; no &apos; vote from a strange coalition of political forces not only in France but in the Netherlands too , and when the indi@@ gesti@@ ble piece of legislation known as the &apos; mini &apos; Treaty of Lisbon is being blocked in Ireland and possibly in the Czech Republic as well , we should prove that Europe is still functioning by relying on the huge area of enhanced cooperation .
From that point of view , it should be a lesson for us .
It is perhaps his right to say he has no answer , but he cannot be allowed to ignore justifiable parliamentary questions , that is not done !
By opening up our universities to the world , we are also opening them up to Europe .
As regards the euro and consumers , I agree with the proposal from Mr P√©rez Royo on dual price display , but I would like this to happen as soon as possible , and the system to be introduced in as short as period of time as possible .
The European Scientific Ste@@ ering Committee must express its views on the relevance of the French arguments because , on Monday , the ad hoc group , which ga@@ thers together European prion disease specialists , was not able to reach a unanimous conclusion and passed the results of its study to the European Scientific Committee .
This report is one of the annual exercises that remind us of the best possible way of ensuring respect for human rights within the European Union .
It is true , as Mr Barroso and Mr Lipietz have reminded us , that the Treaty gives precedence to the provision of public services in cases where such provision conflicts with the rules of competition .
Finally , do you not think that it is all the more urgent to deal with the issue of data protection under the third pillar , with a framework decision ?
The solution , obviously , is to give the Court of Auditors jurisdictional power and adequate human and material resources to take on this role .
The carrot and the stick .
The European Council &quot; s appeal for the EIB to enhance its R &#91; amp &#93; D efforts is , in this context , an innovative and pragmatic solution , if EUR 30 billion actually can be harnessed in this way .
Before the vote :
The question is open and in fact it must be demonstrated that there is real European added value .
I think natural solidarity , and in particular a strong family policy , should be actively supported alongside structured social security , to promote a more human , more flexible and less expensive approach .
In the motion for a resolution to be voted upon at noon tomorrow , the Committee on Development and Cooperation suggests that the following priorities should be adopted , aware as it is that it would scarcely be credible to continue along the path ma@@ pped out by the World Bank in 1993 in its report on Water Res@@ ources Management .
What authority will defend nature in the commercial decision @-@ making of the WTO , a body which has already shown that it gives scant consideration to environmental damage ?
The candidate countries unanimously backed the declarations of the General Affairs Council and the declarations made by the Heads of State and Government .
But , in order for it to come into force , it must be ratified by forty @-@ four specifically designated States amongst which there are the states that actually have nuclear capability , and the nuclear powers , but also those States known as &quot; threshold States &quot; , which are States that , because they have nuclear reactors in the civilian sector , are capable of developing military technology .
Germany has stayed at the top of the class , it has refused to cut down on production and today it is the world &apos; s leading exporter , even with the arrival of China and India on the international stage .
We learn simply that we must , and I quote , &quot; strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union and spell out the meaning of the principle of subsidiarity &apos; - a philosophy which , outlined in this way , remains highly ambiguous since it could result either in the enhancement of a super@@ - state , or the emergence of a Europe of nations .
This F@@ B@@ I of the sea will have the task of coordinating the control and inspection activities of Member States in the fisheries sector .
I believe that today , in the midst of this crisis , clear opportunities are there for the taking .
Regu@@ lar@@ ising the status of illegal immigrants en masse is the way to put a spoke in the wheels of all these dealers in human misery .
Nothing was done .
I believe that , in these conditions , rather than picking apart a directive until there is nothing left of it , it would be much better to stick to the version of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
The European Union has therefore reached a significant milestone , by acknowledging in its Constitutional Treaty that solidarity cannot be limited to its own territory and its own citizens , but should extend beyond its borders .
It is discrimination against the local authorities and civil organisations in the new Member States .
The kidnapp@@ ers of the French hostages are not demanding the withdrawal of troops , because the French Government refused to take part in the war .
Since then , much water has passed under the bridge , and we are now in a position to give an opinion on the report of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee .
These are the answers to your questions .
It would , therefore , be a matter of accepting Mrs Morgantini &apos; s oral amendment and completing it with the following part sentence : &apos; and to call upon the international community to ensure the actual implementation of this multinational force &apos; .
in writing . - Mrs Klamt &apos; s report on the conditions of entry and residence in the European Union of third country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment starts from a correct premise but arri@@ ves at the wrong conclusions .
One of you spoke about 2009 .
These responsibilities must be clearly defined and allocated , but also properly monitored .
I wish someone from the Council had been here this morning : we needed them to be here .
Even if it turns out that substantial amendments are proposed to these reports , the political message being sent to the countries of Central Europe will still run the risk of being a negative message .
I ask you not to overlook the other achievements of the European Council .
That is enough : we have gone too far .
That is a bit weak .
This will constitute a large amount of work for all the Member States , and will require a lot of energy and specialist expertise .
So we are starting to explore this whole issue , which affects tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hi@@ ps but also lifelong learning for workers .
Mr President , I believe I can say that there is no problem about providing a list of investigations launched by UCLAF .
Some say it was a balanced mandate , others that it was inadequate , but it was a mandate whose dynamic force we used to the full , and even almost exceeded .
My question , however , is , more specifically , the following : if Parliament were to vote for a significant increase in the &apos; human rights &apos; budget heading , would you be inclined to move on to an operational phase of the &apos; Vo@@ ice of Europe &apos; project ?
Its negative effects are well @-@ known and , coupled with the blocking of aid for new construction , it bol@@ sters the second @-@ hand market and dissu@@ ades young people from going into jobs connected with fishing .
We do not believe the idea of a lead supervis@@ or would satisfy all the Member States .
Europe &quot; s competitiveness is a constant concern .
Their destitution is terrible , in Azerbaijan , in Georgia and even in Armenia .
Madam President , the successive conferences on biodiversity protection , rather than offering solutions , are , at best , a way of keeping the rather pal@@ try balance sheet up to date in this area .
The second factor is the decline in fertility over recent decades , which followed the &apos; baby boom &apos; of the post @-@ war years and which means that today these &apos; baby bo@@ om@@ ers &apos; are s@@ wel@@ ling the 45 to 65 age group .
The unification of Europe must enable us to overcome all the tragedies of the twentieth century .
That , they will tell us , is what the Treaties say .
I therefore say &apos; yes &apos; to civic sportsmen and sport@@ s@@ women : they should be allowed to say what they want at the Olympic Games . I say &apos; yes &apos; to civic journalists : they should watch the athletes jumping , running , sw@@ im@@ ming , but also , with white , red , black and any other bann@@ ers , they should make Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men S@@ qu@@ are a place of freedom , where people can say what they choose .
We know that no such thing will happen and that , on the contrary , legal immigration is the fore@@ run@@ ner of full @-@ scale immigration .
&apos; whereas the war in Iraq , its various aspects and its consequences continue to be a sensitive issue for public opinion and governments in Europe and the United States &quot; .
Firstly , as regards consumers , I regret that the Commission proposal has not been kept as it was . I regret it has been broadened rather too far , in that it holds consumers , as - shall we say - citizens , every bit as responsible for piracy as industrialists .
As a French overseas member of this Parliament my attention is naturally drawn to the fate of the French territories and administrative authorities concerned , which are , and I am pleased to list them here , New Cal@@ e@@ donia , French Pol@@ y@@ nes@@ ia , the French Southern and An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic Territories , Wallis and Fu@@ tuna , Mayotte and Saint @-@ Pierre and Miquelon .
On the initiative of the Commission , the first European Union @-@ Latin America @-@ Caribbean ministerial dialogue on the environment was opened in March 2008 , as a pre@@ lude to the Lima Summit .
I think that together this forms a solid basis for a genuinely transparent , sincere and ongoing dialogue between our institutions .
First of all , I think that if we consider the reasons why electronic money is less developed here than in Hong Kong , it is undoubtedly because European citizens have become used to using their bank cards much more easily .
Let us adopt this resolution .
Egypt plays an important part in terms of its relationship with the United States and its constructive approach to Israel , but if its relationship with the EU is to deepen , Egypt must take steps towards democracy .
According to experts and specialists in child nutrition , milk is indeed essential to the proper intellectual and physical development of children , of all children .
This important body will be raised to the rank of institution and , in the political sphere , it is a leading force .
That is a realistic compromise between , on the one hand , Mrs Lienemann &apos; s initial position in favour of a zero level of discharges into water and , on the other , the position of the Council , which was opposed to any binding objective .
It is on this basis that the European Union and the ACP countries must from now on work towards eliminating misunderstandings , make progressive and constructive progress in the negotiations and reach agreements that are fully in favour of the development of the ACP countries .
Firstly , by organising the means of intervention better : it is Mr Barnier &apos; s idea to have a European civil protection force capable of intervening in support of the national forces .
Following a request from Iran , signed by a large number of countries , Reporters without Borders was excluded from the NGOs recognised by the UN .
This genocide resulted in the death of over one million people , which was equivalent to nearly two thirds of the country &quot; s largest minority .
Let me use my allotted time , Commissioner , to draw your attention to the fact - in my opinion , a serious one - that the legislation relating to credit rating agencies , which has now entered into force , has not been applied , and that the authorities to which these agencies submitted their files did not take steps to inform them of the requirements of the agreement .
So do not forget : renewables , yes , but renewables with energy savings .
Even in terms of food production , habits have been fo@@ isted on the populations of these countries by forcing them to consume rice or wheat @-@ based products , which they can only obtain on the world market , generating profit along the way for a handful of huge Western companies .
We must make clearly separate two issues .
We must undertake a thorough review of the strategy used by our institutions to communicate with the public .
They are leaving many of our farmers no other option but to launch themselves ill @-@ advis@@ edly and prematurely into introducing new and un@@ tried methods of crop cultivation and animal @-@ rearing , which have not been properly tested and which , therefore , may put public health at risk .
But a fundamental boundary has been over@@ stepped when sexually exploited children are also represented as &apos; workers &apos; .
To combat fundamentalist terrorism we need to completely restructure our own defence mechanisms .
These amendments have been partially fulfilled .
Furthermore , I believe that his arrest is not a snu@@ b towards the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia . Instead it is a relief , because it enables this people , this nation , who certainly have a very honourable and often glori@@ ous history , as well as an extremely troubled recent past , to turn the page once and for all on this extremely troubled recent past , at a time when the whole world is watching .
But we must strike the right balance in this approach based on solidarity , and that is what we have tried to do ; we need to distinguish between rich regions , poor regions in rich countries , and poor regions in poor countries , because they are not quite the same thing .
The regulations are extended , in appropriate forms , to the new audiovisual services .
You can count on the PPE to help work progress quickly .
In fact as the Scientific and Technical Committee on Fisheries has stressed , the measure would have considerable socio @-@ economic consequences for certain small fleets .
If transparency is being introduced , particularly regarding public funds , I feel that everyone should be able to access the information , without restrictions .
I therefore believe that the directive as it stands would leave the door open to every possible abuse and is still geared to satisfy strictly commercial interests .
Some might think , perhaps , that it is obvious .
Unfortunately , any hope we might have of more democratic conditions founders on what we hear of the representation on Parliament &apos; s delegations and committees .
Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that amendments to that treaty will enter into force after ratification by all Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements .
The commitment to leave behind the separated structures , which only very in@@ adequately prepare people with disabilities for integration and independence , in order to enable them to participate fully in society and to combat prejudice , has its price .
Unfortunately that has not happened , and that is why I shall be voting against this report .
The clarification of the scope of the VAT system for the supply of natural gas , heat and re@@ frig@@ eration will enable the Member States to apply reduced VAT rates to the supply of these goods as envisaged by the Directive .
I would like to inform my honourable friend that if he wishes to combat increases in health spending , he should tackle the real causes .
In particular , I supported four amendments that I consider essential not only for safeguarding the European wine @-@ growing industry , especially in Bur@@ gun@@ dy and Fran@@ che Com@@ t√© , but also for making it more competitive .
At the same time , I think it is useful to stress that this construction will not stand up by itself .
While promoting electronic commerce and the information society , the Commission intends at the beginning of 1998 to draft a proposal for a directive on the issuance of electronic money , which will be a response to the criteria I have just alluded to .
It is to dare to go beyond what is left un@@ said , the soo@@ thing proposals , the Community han@@ go@@ ver , and dare to call a spade a spade and a crisis a crisis .
Every day your Europe is being ec@@ lip@@ sed more and more in the face of the globalisation achieved by finance , whose centre of gravity is in the United States , and now it is through Europe , through the Commission , through the European Parliament that the most dubious regulations of this globalisation are being fo@@ isted on our fellow citizens .
Lastly , it was because of these three principles that we voted for Mrs Ainardi &quot; s proposals . The latter provide for social and environmental issues to be taken into account and for high safety requirements .
I am not the only one to think this as Mr Desama would have said the same if he had been able to speak . Our Dutch colleague , Mr van den Berg , also agrees as he asked me to say that in this case he has witnessed , in addition to a responsible attitude from the Belgians , ...
First human rights , and then of course the reference to Turkey .
The civil association R@@ AI@@ D AT@@ TAC Tunisia , the leaders of which were imprisoned at the beginning of the year , has still not been authorised .
It provides a stimulus large enough to have an impact in every Member State : around 1.5 % of European Union GDP represents a significant amount of money , if well spent .
We had spoken about this with Mr B√∂ge .
There is no doubt that the new French President supports the &apos; yes &apos; vote .
Those , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , are the three major challenges for the months and years ahead that I wanted to draw your attention to .
I am sorry to say this but we cannot go further because otherwise , it would immediately mess things up in other countries .
On the other hand , some of the restrictions introduced by the Commission must be removed .
Mr Brown , it is not enough to condemn protectionism abroad .
The rapporteur has gone to great lengths to obtain a compromise ; this text contained some good points , not least the idea that pension systems should guarantee all citizens a decent standard of living , that diversity should be respected , that inequalities between men and women are unacceptable and unjustifiable , that a life course approach should be taken and that older workers should be rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
Germany is the largest economy in Europe .
According to the thinking behind the financial regulation , the long @-@ term objective is to issue invitations , open to everyone , to submit proposals , with the famous &apos; earmarking &quot; , the method sometimes used now for allocating subsidies , being the exception .
I think it is desirable for all European languages to enjoy equal rights , not only in these Erasmus Mundus programmes , but also in all of the European institutions .
If Europe disap@@ points , euro@@ scepticism will increase .
Unfortunately , traditional accoun@@ tancy methods attach little importance to intangible assets .
There is no point , in my view , in solving one problem by creating 26 others .
Unless an elev@@ enth @-@ hour candidacy is received from Ku@@ wait or Nepal , at the instigation of the United States , we could well see Syria heading up the UN Human Rights Council on 20 May .
. Our opposition to the Brok report is consistent with our opposition to how the whole enlargement process has been conducted .
Even though the financing of the CAP is being safeguarded and the budget devoted to SMEs seems to be enhanced , the Galileo project , the trans @-@ European transport networks , research , regional policy , education and training and culture will be sacrificed .
On the latter point , I would emphasise the importance of the Commission &apos; s policy study analysing the effectiveness , impact and practical feasibility of a system of this type : we need to have access to an objective assessment of its usefulness and of its real , not just assumed , added value .
This post @-@ control system for seed and propag@@ ating material marketed in the Community is recognised as being an extremely important tool for the harmonisation of marketing by Member States .
And you tell us that you are going to use this new dialogue .
On several occasions , the general public has said that it does not understand the mass slaughter of animals when the virus poses no danger to humans .
Consequently , the vote to appoint the Commission was a mere formality , an &apos; administrative yes &apos; .
Wor@@ ds cannot express the horror of the situation or the atrocities suffered by the people of Palestine who are denied the most fundamental rights .
We have strong bilateral relationships with Algeria , Morocco , Tunisia and Egypt , too .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I also wish to congratulate Mrs Gomes on the quality of her work on an extremely sensitive and complex issue .
Report ( A5 @-@ 0@@ 100 / 1999 ) by Mr Virrankoski , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the supplementary estimates to Parliament &apos; s budget estimates for 2000
in writing . - I voted in favour of the compromise reached with the Council on 30 November concerning REACH , following in the foot@@ steps of the three large political groups ( the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe ) . I did this so that our fellow citizens might quickly have legislation - the entry into force of which is scheduled for 1 April 2007 - controlling the use of chemical substances in our sta@@ ple goods .
We can hope today that the G8 will also shoulder its responsibilities with the European countries that are going to push for measures to be taken against climate change .
That is akin to aggravated theft or at the very least to expropriation without compensation .
In the context of a crisis of confidence in a Europe that is apparently no longer able to offer its citizens a reformed economic model , a competitive model , a model that is fit to rise to the great challenges of the 21st century , the Heads of State or Government have thought it appropriate to reduce by EUR 150 million the amount of payment appropriations proposed by the Commission .
It does so to the advantage of the latter , outlining for each their prerogatives and obligations , which is one measure amongst others of good operation .
That is why we welcome the initiative by the Belgian Presidency to schedule an extraordinary and informal meeting of the European Council for next Friday and we are pleased to take part in today &apos; s debate in the European Parliament .
The first is the issue of the &apos; responsibility to protect &apos; .
Naturally , if the legal basis - which we shall be examining , as I said before - is such that we find ourselves partly within the first pillar , in such an eventu@@ ality the Council will have no problem in discussing the matter with Parliament , and I shall gladly come before the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs once again to discuss it in detail .
The same is true of trainees .
We must , by adopting a firm policy , do what we can to encourage those within the regime who wish to work towards a policy of democratisation , towards a policy of reconciliation .
May your positive intervention , Mr President , convince the Convention , the European Council and Europe as a whole to choose intelligence over stupidity , to opt for a federal constitution .
The reason why the European Union is now wholly opposed to ultra @-@ liberal globalisation is because everyone has realised that it has become globalisation &apos; s main sho@@ e@@ hor@@ n , including at the last WTO summit at Doha .
I have also been very alert to the comments made by some Members about the new Member States and about countries with a lower audiovisual production capacity or a small linguistic area .
In that respect , the Commission also had to embark upon a study with a view to sending information to the European Parliament and to examining any proposals that would be worth presenting .
The second reason is that the draft Statute included in this report adds provisions to the Treaty establishing the European Community , to the 1976 Act and to the Protocol on the privileges and im@@ munities of the European Communities - something it does not have the power to do .
The GALILEO programme is all the more important because it guarantees that the high technology and the activity of our industries will be maintained in the future , since 150 000 jobs will be created .
It is up to the Palestinian authorities , and to them alone , to decide who is eligible on the basis of their own criteria .
I would like to say that , above and beyond these three points , the most important thing for me is that we quickly build a politically solid Europe , to speed up enlargement in the East in order to strengthen democracy , to eliminate the residues of National Communism and to reassure democratic governments by giving them the possibility of association and then accession .
We have the political and economic resources to impose our choices and to ensure that they are respected .
That is why I call on you to vote in favour of this report .
This clearly demonstrates the fact not only that this regulation of the European institutions may be sideste@@ pped , but that , even when it is applied , it does not protect you@@ ths from employers &apos; thirst for profits .
There are economic and social implications .
This Friday is the International Day of Action on HIV and AIDS .
They are three states@@ men by virtue , frankly , of their age , but some would also say by virtue of their experience or their wisdom .
The report which we are to adopt does not reflect this ambition .
S@@ hor@@ t@@ falls in this field , or even the absence of such policies , will have perceptible effects , not only in the field of foreign policy as such , in Yugoslavia , the Middle East , Africa , or elsewhere , but also in the commercial field .
- The proposal for a regulation before us today seeks to provide an appropriate legal basis to enable the European Union to fund a number of bodies which have been set up by the international community following conflicts and which are responsible either for implementing certain peace agreements , as is the case in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , or for ensuring the interim civilian administration of certain regions , as is the case , at present , in Kosovo .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , Madam Vice @-@ President , on the issue of the Stability and Growth Pact , our group unequivocally backs the efforts of the Luxembourg Presidency and , in particular , supports the idea of a list of relevant factors , as indicated by Mr Juncker .
How could it have been otherwise , when the subject has virtually become a major stake in the internal policy of every Member State of the European Community ?
We must improve how the system works .
This is something that I consider to be important .
The second observation relates to the issue of retention .
Have the courage , instead , to protect European agriculture and stop letting the World Trade Organisation decide the fate of our farms .
They are the minimum standards satisfying the most people and it is advisable not to down@@ grade them , even if pressure is growing to reduce regulation .
The majority of the Commissioners @-@ designate - I do not say all - had no determination , vision or ambition .
It recommends a long @-@ term policy which specifically includes energy savings and the use of renewable energy sources .
The reality , then , is that it is preparing a future alter@@ ation to the States &apos; democratic legitimacy and changes the nature of the EU , which has up until now been a union of states representing their peoples .
There is , once again , a perceived lack of solidarity and a high degree of timidity .
We must move forward hand @-@ in @-@ hand and I will never forget that you are the representatives of the European people .
My final message is directly for the banks .
There are also ethical and philosophical implications .
- We are facing a terrifying danger , and that is forgetting .
The principle of subsidiarity will be held up to ridicule , as it has been for the past 12 years .
Let us take pride in those who do not wish for Europe to become a free trade area , and let us take pride in those who , like us and like millions of others , believe that Europe is a complex continent that deserves more than a free trade area .
So do we really need a third @-@ generation agreement with mixed enterprises involving a significant return for Morocco and privileged relations ?
Finally , Madam President , Europe , as a source of hope , calls out for that which is best in each people to be shared and po@@ ol@@ ed .
As for the general budget , in my opinion , I think that although it appears to have a degree of approval from the Council , I believe I am right in saying that the Swedish Presidency proposes to hold an initial informal discussion on the budget at the Research Council on 26 June .
We are proposing to introduce a bridging clause .
Of course , there is also this other mis@@ match between the solemn proclamation of great principles and the socio@@ political realities which , sadly , make human rights remain unheeded .
It seems to me , however , that the Commission must be cau@@ tioned against any attempt to down@@ grade our social security schemes in the name of so @-@ called European harmonization .
Roman lawyers had already given this type of reversed proof the name &quot; diabolical proof &apos; , since it is so difficult to establish .
Madam President , first of all I must congratulate the rapporteur on the effort he has put in in such a specialized field .
The proposed Agency will be yet another bureaucratic body .
The Commission cannot accept this , but we shall try to find a compromise .
Concerning the implementation of European solidarity , the Council backs the increase in aid to farmers , proposing a compensation of 6@@ 4.@@ 2 % of lost earnings instead of the 60 % initially proposed .
You will recall that this regulation trans@@ poses , at Community level , the security measures adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in December 2002 , particularly the IS@@ PS code on the security of ships and port facilities .
We trust the Feira European Council will acknowledge all the progress made .
They are wrong because prosperity is not generated by the European Union and its 80 000 pages of directives and regulations .
That is why I find it interesting that some of you - in particular Mr Corbett , and also Mr M√©ndez de Vigo , I am told - have made progress in finding a way out of this dead end .
Yet , what are these powers , before , during and after these natural disasters ?
I am afraid that in reality , in countries as lax as France in this regard , all this will not limit the influx of illegal immigration .
What this means , where France , for example , is concerned , is another step closer to the privatisation of √â@@ lec@@ tri@@ cit√© and G@@ az de France , a process that we reject entirely .
Whilst we undermine our own industry &apos; s fishing possibilities , other fishermen from third countries are coming in their place .
We must now bring this episode to a conclusion and , furthermore , my group believes that we must learn some strategic lessons from it for the future .
The third effect of budgetary expansion is the dispers@@ al of cash people have been ho@@ ar@@ ding , prior to the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January next year . No one ever mentions this , but it is nevertheless happening .
Once again , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from each political group - I can see Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt , but I am thinking of all my fellow Members and I cannot mention them all . I want to thank them because they all played an active role in and made a major contribution to the efforts to reach this political agreement with the Council on 21 December , which will be successfully concluded tomorrow .
Parliament , in its latest resolutions , clearly listed the conditions with which such an arrangement would have to comply for Cyprus to be able to fully meet its obligations as a Member of the EU .
This fear , which has been mentioned several times by many of my colleagues , led me to table an amendment to this effect , which was adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and which features in Mr Hatzidakis &apos; s excellent report .
The Council recognises that the human rights situation in the Middle East is a matter of concern .
A year on , studies have been conducted that even more clearly highlight the dangers of releasing GMOs .
This would not be too serious if significant progress had been made during the five previous years , but this is not the case .
Our objective at the European Council in Nice is to arrive at as comprehensive as possible an overview of the state of negotiations , in order to provide effective guidance for the work of future presidencies and to clearly sign@@ post the route to accession .
And so , those who pretend to believe that a few prudential rules and a few coordinators who have no real power can eradicate speculation , scandals and financial crises from the capitalist economy will be those who therefore vote in favour of this report .
There we have a genuine environmental policy .
The consequence of the well @-@ documented shortage in the training of medical staff - doctors , nurses , and so forth - in the EU is that Member States turn to doctors from developing countries , thereby exacerbating the shortage in those countries .
Firstly , I hope that Mrs Kuneva will continue her work , and I hope that she can get a draft horizontal directive adopted .
Rule 112 of our Rules of Procedure refers to Rule 60 ( 1 ) , &quot; A request that a debate on a proposal on which Parliament has been consulted pursuant to Rule 60 ( 1 ) be treated as urgent ... &quot;
If I may , a few days short of my six@@ tieth birth@@ day , try to put myself in the shoes of a young European , the advantages I might see in the European adventure might well be , among others , the greater ease with which I might learn foreign languages and the possibility of participating in school exchanges , intern@@ ships , sporting tour@@ nam@@ ents and cultural events - all this while crossing virtual frontiers and using a single currency . That is not something to be s@@ nee@@ zed at .
The EU is far from being out@@ done and that is why it should be able to benefit from its credibility and its &apos; good reputation &apos; in this regard , with a view to establishing social alliances with its main trading partners and promoting these at the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) and International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) .
I would like to make one final remark on the international role of the euro .
At the same time , efforts will continue or will be stepped up at national level in order to gradually reduce the early school @-@ leaving rate by 2020 , in accordance with the target set by the European Council .
So was Mr Bayrou .
The same cannot be said of the President of Catalonia .
That is my answer to Mr √ì Neachtain .
This summit will also have to evaluate the unexpected results of the Irish referendum on ratifying the Treaty of Nice .
The bulle@@ tin of the French Em@@ bas@@ sy , which I consulted yesterday on the Internet , says that growth is continual and that stability is guaranteed for prices , the currency and public finances .
Several countries demanded an increase in the number of members from the national parliaments , perhaps so that the ruling coalition could have better representation , perhaps to take into account sub @-@ national entities or perhaps because of the bi @-@ cam@@ eral system .
I would point out that we need to distinguish clearly between the resumption of negotiations and the holding of the European Union @-@ Russia Summit of 14 November .
One could therefore be forgiven for wondering if these amendments are simply demagogic .
Will it be the farmers ?
My colleague , Mrs Reding , is responsible for the proactive part and will now update you on our progress .
Does that mean that it has to forget its most fundamental principles ?
This is an issue which touches upon all areas and which all Commissioners must bear in mind , and this is why I myself will act as chairman of the group with Mr Frattini , Vice @-@ President of the Commission , as vice @-@ chairman .
In any event , we hope to achieve this in the short term by proposing , in forthcoming weeks and months , in the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference , the text for a proposal for an amendment to Article 191 which will complement this article , make it operational and more precise , and which will therefore provide a clear , sound , transparent and definitive legal basis for the organisation of political parties at European level .
Certainly , the Government of Ukraine claims that in order to close down Chernobyl , it is necessary to build new power stations as soon as possible .
This is why the Council will make a special effort with new technologies .
The governance of the structures that develop these accounting standards is a very important matter .
We must not overlook the human implications of these problems .
Allow me to quote in full the explanation of Fernand Herman , because it should not be forgotten by those who follow in our wake .
Wel@@ fare and retirement pensions would no longer be rights but would be commodities subject to the laws of the market .
However , I believe that nothing will be achieved without genuine economic coordination and economic governance .
The first is the lack of precision and the weakness of the Commission &apos; s projections .
I believe that is very important for what lies ahead .
He has himself made allusion , in his supplementary question , to the issue of the disappearance of objective 6 . This is the proposal of the Commission which , in its communication on Agenda 2000 , in the chapter relating to economic and social cohesion , proposes , for reasons of eligibility and efficiency , to reduce the number of current objectives to three .
In addition to the restrictive reading of Article 2@@ 86 , however , it would have been possible to take Article 2@@ 55 of the Treaty as a further legal basis in order to expand the scope of this regulation .
By way of conclusion , I would like to say that reason has always been a victim of hatred , violence and fear .
This finding has led the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to demand that the convocation of the new IGC ( responsible for carrying out the next revision of the Treaties ) should be based on a fundamentally different process , a process which is open and transparent .
France will strive to provide new impetus to this progress towards co @-@ development , making use of its experience in this area .
Thus the central site , installed in Strasbourg , where we are , has experienced some delays .
That would truly be an historic initiative , a first .
At the extraordinary session of 21 September , the Council decided that the fight against terrorism will , now more than ever , be a strategic priority of the European Union .
This report might well have passed un@@ noticed by the public .
We have to be able to find a way of providing greater flexibility , avoiding speculation and monopolies and making frequencies accessible to new services and new entrants .
You had to guide me through some difficult decisions .
Mr President , in December the European Court of Justice handed down a long @-@ awaited judgment that has very worrying implications for the protection of posted workers in Europe .
Furthermore , given that it preserves the vital acquis of French consumer law , such as the &apos; lat@@ ent defect &apos; guarantee , and the fact that all methods of payment are free of charge , I believe this new directive to be a step forward .
The rule of law in our democratic societies is at stake .
The rules of contractual autonomy , the rules on validity , defects of consent and publicity have been fixed in our civilisation since ancient times .
The accusations flying around on all sides in yesterday &apos; s debate - &apos; The Council is to blame ! &apos;
Secondly , what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available ?
We could also deal with this problem on the occasion of the next enlargement .
Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Elmar Brok , and all the rapporteurs who examined the files on the individual candidate countries .
However , we rejected the amendments which , on the pretext of maintaining balanced competition , bow to pressure from the lobbies - primarily the airline lobbies - and will do nothing more than delay the implementation of essential measures or will ensure that the measures taken will not meet the legitimate expectations of the public and the staff concerned .
We have all abolished it in Europe , but unfortunately that is not the case in other parts of the world .
It would only be necessary , for example , to label meat from the United Kingdom &apos; British beef &apos; for consumers - households or restaurants - to know exactly what they were buying .
Thank you , Mrs Hautala , for having done so much work , which was not easy .
the report by Carlos Coelho , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on migration to the second generation Schengen Information System ( decision ) ( 1@@ 20@@ 59 / 1 / 2008 - C6 @-@ 0@@ 188 / 2008 - , and
I therefore think that the logical step for me , as rapporteur , is to re @-@ table these amendments in the plenary .
If it is true , as the report states , that we have seen a return to growth , then it is all the more appalling that , throughout Europe , only a tiny minority benefits from it .
Finally , our fellow member has cited information which he was delighted to indicate was given to him by the B@@ BC .
However , it is important to have intelligent taxation , so that the ones paying are not transport SMEs , drivers and still less consumers , but large ship@@ pers and major customers such as the large @-@ scale distribution sector .
There is another , more technical reason , involving some subtle points .
Is it not the case that unemployment in the United Kingdom has been reduced to 5 % of the active population ?
I should like to say in particular to Mr Lage and his fellow Portuguese Members that I was very touched by their words of thanks .
The facts make this clear .
Two systems are involved here : exchange of information between tax authorities and withholding tax .
Here , as elsewhere , multi@@ cultur@@ alism has its limits .
Ad@@ mit that by underestimating the specific size of the European wheat crop , you made it difficult for contracts to be signed .
How then do we rationalise , manage and share access to these reserves in such a way that the communities concerned really derive benefit from them without seeing their environment v@@ and@@ alised ?
Through the Prime Minister , the French Government has indicated that an agreement of this kind cannot in any way challenge the freedom of governments to implement their choices .
On seeing these pictures , everyone wondered what freedom Rugova enjoyed , while &apos; protected &apos; by the Serb police , in a country that has been emp@@ tied of its inhabitants .
Then , at Feira in Portugal , on the occasion of the Council meeting in June 2000 , a clear call was made for the specific characteristics of sport to be taken into account in the application of Community policies .
It is unrealistic because everyone knows , and indeed everyone is saying , that there is a wide gap between the appropriations committed and the appropriations taken up .
This means that companies are only interested in illnesses that generate money .
The United Nations could set up a major diplomatic initiative in order to isolate North Korea completely .
It is important to reach agreement as soon as possible , and I raised the question just this morning with the President of the European Council , Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der .
Mr President , Commissioner Oreja has presented flexibility to us from one particular angle , solely as a means of moving still further towards integration .
I suggest , therefore , that I come back to Mr Burke later and the Council services will provide him with precise information on the 2009 budget as soon as they obtain it - I have been told that we only have incomplete information at present .
I would , however , ask you , ladies and gentlemen , whether it is normal for those amongst you who are most committed to Europe to be able to vote now alongside extremists who do not want Europe , members of the extreme right who are against Europe , people who are completely opposed to the advancement of our European project ...
Subject : Opening of dialogue in Cuba
That earned the US econom@@ ist , Gar@@ i Bec@@ ker , a Nobel Prize .
Do I need to remind you of the definition of this single market provided by the Commissioner in charge of monitoring it , Mr McCreevy ?
Mr Napolitano , the rapporteur , is proposing a number of specific measures which have been approved by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and which could , in my view , easily receive the unanimous approval of the Convention .
In that regard , I would also pay tribute to the work done by Dir@@ k Sterckx .
The Algerian authorities would thus be well advised to use other means to re @-@ establish the rule of law in Algeria and not to attack the powers of the press , one of the pillars of the new society they are preparing to build .
Indeed the vote in the committee was not unanimous .
Mr President , at this late stage in voting time , it is exasper@@ ating to have to point out that the House is incapable of applying the decisions that it takes .
Naturally , we are pleased that the European Parliament is being consulted again on the subject .
Can they not see the political necessity of inspiring confidence in Europe as a whole by demonstrating to the citizens of the small and future Member States that the Commission , in its role of guardian of the Treaty , is not strict with the small ones and weak with the big ones ?
He told us that he is going to start the task of rebuilding as soon as he has been s@@ worn in , which should happen on 28 July , Peru &apos; s national holiday .
Not sur@@ pris@@ ingly , this report contains a r@@ inging endorsement of the draft European Constitution , the effect of which would be , however , to remove the definition of fundamental human rights from the competence of each nation , and to shift it instead to European level , where no one is in control of anything any more .
New initiatives are , therefore , being taken , progress is being made , and I must say that , despite all the difficulties that exist , governments are moving in the direction described because they have understood the absolute need for such measures .
I am convinced that , in recent times , life has in fact resolved many points which are controversial , particularly on the part to be played by the united Europe in the debate on how the world &quot; s affairs should be managed .
Sanctions must be followed up and we must be able to guarantee consumers the highest level of safety in order to restore the public &apos; s confidence in their farmers and in their political leaders .
Lastly , I believe that we must hold a genuine political debate at European level on what we mean by services of general interest and on the rules that we wish to apply to them .
That gives us something else to think about in our future deliberations .
This resolution drew particular attention to the case of Mr K@@ h√©@@ ma√Øs Cham@@ mari , member of parliament , head of the Mouvement des D√©mo@@ crates Soci@@ alistes , who had been arrested and committed to the civil prison in Tunis .
That echoes an ambition that I stated during my hearing before this House for consumers to re@@ claim the domestic market through specific projects .
Therefore , I will vote for the resolution by Mr McCartin so that the Commission can negotiate with this industry to allow individuals and small businesses to rectify this &apos; error &apos; . It is to be hoped that they will do so without , yet again , having to pay for a problem that has been evident for a long time yet for which they are not responsible .
This is our position .
This means that whatever happens , she will make up the lost ground in terms of political and economic back@@ wardness in the near future , as she was doing at the turn of the century before the revolution put a stop to that progressive momentum .
To that , I would tend to say no , particularly if our actions are examined in general terms .
The aim of these amendments is to enhance the information given to citizens and to stimulate the debate on issues relating to the future of the European Union , pursuant to Declaration 23 of the Treaty of Nice .
Those who support the Schulz report are bound to be repro@@ ached with having created a dangerous precedent , to the extent that Parliament would thus have taken on the obligation to give its opinion on any future nomination that might be criticized in any way .
S@@ pending should create the necessary conditions for lasting growth , employment , security and solidarity .
For the past year , we have been ri@@ ding rou@@ gh@@ sh@@ od over the rule that , under the terms of Rule 24 of the Rules of Procedure , allows non @-@ attached Members to appoint their own representative .
For all these reasons , it was well worth adding this item to our agenda .
As regards drugs , it is needs that must dictate our strategy for action to deal with the worldwide issue of health and development .
To us this looks like two different types of visits , but that is not clear from the text and it would be advisable to clarify the matter .
We studied them and we can accept three of them , which are in line with the way we voted in committee .
The same applies , incidentally , to the difficult issue of the numer@@ us cl@@ au@@ sus , which threatens to arise more and more frequently as professionals become more and more mobile within the Community - something which , of course , we can only welcome .
We should work towards achieving three things .
The result of all this can be summarised in four points .
The loss of a sense of values in univers@@ alism is the direct cause of the increase in what must be called - for lack of a better word - &apos; identity @-@ ism &apos; , ethnic@@ ism , trib@@ alism and the most medi@@ ev@@ al of religi@@ osity .
Some are inevitable : 2004 is full of uncertainty , with the European elections , the renewal of the Commission and the Intergovernmental Conference , the outcome of which no one can know in advance .
Since the Commission was informed of Dell &apos; s strategy concerning the existence of two sites , when the prospect of choosing between them presented itself , I believe that a more proactive strategy by the Commission should have led to a negotiation with Dell aimed at the transformation of the Irish site , given that the company &apos; s strategy has been to turn a site manufacturing des@@ k@@ top computers , such as existed in Ireland , into a site manufacturing lap@@ top computers , such as currently exists in Poland .
We must also start to collectively think about children &apos; s living conditions in the various European countries particularly in urban areas , and initiate a form of collaboration as well as financial resources in order to help families in difficulty , particularly in the case of single @-@ parent families or of vulnerable parents .
I would also like to hear the Presidency speak about the efforts made or not made by the Member States to ensure that the European Union did not appear disorganised at this conference , a state of affairs that was particularly pitiful .
I also supported the reference to the need to improve the sexual and reproductive health of women both in Europe and globally , and the encouragement that needs to be given to fathers to share family responsibilities , by taking advantage of parental leave , for example .
I would like to congratulate Brice Hortefeux on his excellent work on the European immigration pact .
It is undeniably true that in this area Europe has definitely failed to keep up with international competition .
Yes , solutions must be found .
This report , which is the result of the un@@ rel@@ enting efforts of Mrs Aubert , to whom I pay tribute , is therefore terribly important for the entire sector and provides Parliament with a unique opportunity to distance itself from the Council and the Commission .
At a time when world peace is on the edge of a precip@@ ice , it would not be dis@@ honourable - quite the contrary - to refrain , despite the Hom@@ er@@ ic speeches and the money that has been spent , from an act which is so unjust , so contrary to human rights , and so dangerous .
Promoting the reconciliation of professional life and private life is the last achievement , but not the least . It enables our fellow citizens to achieve a balance that is essential for their well @-@ being .
We therefore believe that these projects must be looked into by the different innovation and research bodies that exist in the regions and also on a national level .
Unfortunately , the allocated amounts were not used correctly .
in writing . - Buil@@ dings are responsible for about 40 % of energy consumption and about 36 % of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union .
This would , of course , require a political will .
Some of them are still here .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis warmly , in particular because he has produced a genuinely realistic report , but some of his observations , which are rather disturbing , should be of particular concern to us .
This is the second thing that propaganda has achieved , namely to make us lose sight of one of the conditions for world order , that is a world of sovereign nations who cooperate with one another and are well @-@ balanced .
That was the first thing that they said .
Are you absolutely sure of that , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office ?
Similarly , defence of the natural principle of national or community preference can also find itself being pursued , condemned , in the name of political correctness , in the name of the thought police .
I must say that , in this field , which has already been widely discussed , the situation is absolutely unacceptable .
Although the agreement is interesting because it integrates the human rights dimension and consultation of civil society , it nevertheless deserved a more extensive debate on its possible impact , both positive and negative .
That gives us the right to raise the issue of how the institution to which you belong operates .
Of course , the rules of competition also apply to the mail , and do so precisely at the point where it enjoys a monopoly or acts as the provider of a reserved service .
The only known exception to this rule was the e@@ ph@@ em@@ eral Confederation of Independent States , which we inevitably think of when the concept of a federation of nation states comes up .
How many programmes will we need in order to cancel out the disastrous effect of President Chirac &quot; s visit to Tunisia , where he stated that there were no human rights problems , and , in the middle of a hunger strike by an eminent lawyer , that the main right is the right to eat ?
It is important for the regulations of the various countries of the European Union to be harmonised .
I voted in favour of this report , which proposes the introduction of a certain uniformity amongst Member States in terms of quality and the expert capabilities of classification societies , whose recognition will henceforth be the preserve of the shared responsibility of the Member S@@ ates and the European Commission .
These binding measures should involve not only the detention of dangerous ships but also the seizure of such vessels and their contents .
The WTO and the WTO conference together represent the slave market emb@@ ell@@ ished by Ricardo , Adam Smith and other fraudulent pre@@ ach@@ ers of the jungle Bi@@ ble .
This assessment alone will provide a basis for an appropriate consideration of the future of tobacco growing in Europe .
Likewise , I believe that it is important - thank@@ fully , you also emphasised it - to involve NGOs and African civil society in the process a lot more and a lot better ; I also mentioned dias@@ pora@@ s , but that relates to here .
Through this resolution , the European Parliament is strongly expressing its solidarity with the Syrian , Bah@@ ra@@ ini and Y@@ em@@ en@@ i citizens , who are showing great courage in demonstrating their aspirations while faced with government forces who are opening fire on un@@ armed civilians .
I think it is our duty to try to make a decision as quickly as possible .
Lastly , establishing the agencies throughout EU territory makes Europe closer to its citizens and permits a certain degree of decentralisation of EU activities .
With regard to the crisis which has affected a large part of Asia for several months , an issue which will certainly be discussed at the London Summit , it is important that the Union participates actively in the implementation of financial and economic measures to curb the recession mechanisms .
We are , of course , in favour of direct aid to projects on the ground .
I would next like to tell the PPE @-@ DE Group that my thanks go to the chairman of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , Mr Gargani , who contributed greatly to the positive outcome of the conciliation process .
On the contrary , I believe that by improving fraud prevention this office can guide us in the future in order to ensure greater openness and to eliminate criticisms like those which have been made recently . I continue to refute that the Commission has exerted or is exerting any pressure on UCLAF .
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Santini and Mrs Wallis , for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , for the quality of their work .
This very simple benchmark is still not being sufficiently recognised by G@@ Ps .
This astounding reversal of opinion needs to be studied seriously ; its causes must be analysed if we hope to get back on course .
We know how complicated the study of groundwater is , and we also know that , once a body of water is polluted , it remains so for years .
These two examples support our vision of the conflict .
It is the addition of ambitious measures relating to clean technologies , to energy efficiency in buildings and transport systems , and to the promotion of green jobs that will give rise to the hopes of tomorrow , hopes of an agreement at the forthcoming Canc√∫n Summit , greater hopes of a common world vision .
The legal framework does not , in fact , allow it to consult Parliament on strategy papers currently being studied within the offices of the Council .
It is by combining all of these efforts , and not by limiting ourselves to systematic police clam@@ p@@ downs only on motorists , that we will succeed in significantly reducing the number of deaths on our roads .
I also agree with you on the importance of providing points of single contact that are genuinely multilingual - an essential part of their added value - so that people can use them in their own language and can receive a response in their own language , including across borders , and so that we can therefore make this tool - the points of single contact - accessible , in particular , to small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
This point must be stressed , Mr President .
Migration is also focused on urban areas and it is there , too , that population changes have the greatest impact .
It would be very useful for me , as Commissioner for Sport , to have the specific characteristics of sport included , because I could at last ! create a programme specific to sport , which I alone am currently unable to do .
As the Commission has already had occasion to emphasise in the White Paper on governance , each of our institutions must , of course , concentrate on its essential tasks .
On the other hand , can this crisis , and the defence of the environment , be an opportunity for growth ?
Yet I am hearing that the euro zone will be a zone of stability .
The only means of creating jobs and ensuring genuine economic and social cohesion is to re@@ examine the issue of the single currency , which subjects economic policies and national budgets to the domination of the financial markets .
Those two amendments should be considered in conjunction with the debate that is beginning within the G20 on the risks posed to all the world &apos; s economies by the &apos; currency war &apos; and any national monetary initiatives that could throw exchange rates out of balance .
Yet again , the proposals that represent positive developments are not binding . Moreover , the report as a whole does not raise the standard of national legislations but levels them down .
These studies are published .
That is my first point and I shall wind up very quickly , too quickly for my liking , but I appreciate that Parliament has a timetable .
Some have said : &apos; Why should we elect you ?
It calls , however , in particular for a new dialogue , which must include the problems of development and of good governance .
Finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coast@@ guards who supervise the coasts of the United States .
Indeed , 16 out of 35 agencies now receive individual discharge from Parliament .
Reco@@ gn@@ ising the fundamental social and economic rights of immigrants legally present within the territory of the European Union and of new arri@@ vals will help improve their integration and will therefore lead to better social cohesion .
We might do well here to draw on the experience of the United States , which created a national control body - the Security and Ex@@ change Commission - by establishing a regulatory body responsible for harmonising the provisions of national regulations so as to allow secondary financial markets to develop .
Now , all that remains before us is the last home stretch , the final 10 % of the problems referred to by several honourable Members during these debates .
Mr President , would we really be exercising our power if we entered into a conciliation procedure , which we know will result in our having no directive ?
I must tell you that references to the situation of European farmers compared to the small farmers of developing countries present me with a moral problem .
As for the Citi@@ zen of Europe , no one has ever met him : in fact he does not exist .
It will probably result in a few more rejec@@ tions but we shall take it to the end .
Mr President , I asked for the floor five minutes ago , firstly in order to congratulate you on the way in which you have conducted the sitting .
Now is the time to send this entire b@@ attered region some strong political signals , such as a decision to pros@@ cri@@ be all recourse to war in future as a way of resolving the world &quot; s problems , or the implementation of the Quartet &quot; s commitments , that have never been kept , to restore the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people , or substantial aid for the creation of civil society - and I salute the representatives of civil society who were welcomed by my group yesterday - and a totally free and sovereign authority in Iraq .
the oral question to the Council by Mr Markov and Mr Sturdy , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Community and its Member States , of the one part , and the SADC EPA States , of the other part - B6 @-@ 020@@ 9 / 2009 ) ,
F@@ lo@@ ods and ecological catastrophes are becoming ever more frequent ; desertification is gathering pace , and it is against this background , with time running out , that we will go to Johannesburg in September .
The vote on these resolutions will take place on Wednesday , that is , tomorrow .
And I share the opinion of Jan Colom i Naval : a sum of one billion E@@ cus deserved a Chamber which did not look like a desert .
These authorities must be part of a legislative and regulatory framework in the public interest .
I believe that the European Parliament well understands that simply abolishing the publication of judicial and legal announcements in regional newspapers , for example , would have disastrous consequences .
Given that we have a willing partner , one with an institution charged with data protection , I really believe we have reasons for hoping that this agreement will be applied with complete respect for data protection .
First , the current regulation expires on 31 December 2011 .
I also used to wonder about an ad@@ vert for Iran ; at a time when public st@@ on@@ ings took place there , we used to allow ad@@ verts for that ser@@ ap@@ hic country .
In particular , it will be important to simplify and accelerate the allocation procedures , especially in favour of SMEs , and to encourage funding through multi @-@ funds and cross @-@ funding .
However , if you wish , I could send you such a list in writing .
Consumers want to be certain of the operators &apos; ability to monitor the origin of meat accurately .
We are asking that they should not be penalised financially .
I agree with what Mr Schulz said .
The recent Union troika which visited Burma ( Myanmar ) between 13 and 15 March expressed its hope that the negotiations under way between the National League for Democracy and the N@@ C@@ P@@ D would continue and reiterated our hope that this process would at last bring about tangible results .
The Commission agreed to provide a proposal for a Community air traffic controller licence quickly .
Although its activities in recent years have produced excellent results , it must nevertheless be noted that this programme is facing administrative problems connected to its cross @-@ border nature and to the fact that it is supported by a number of different sources of funding .
The Heads of State and Government made the Community patent a priority at Lisbon and it was due to come into being before the end of 2001 .
Mr President , the great challenges which await us - expansion , deepening of a European reality while respecting national identities by the new approach of subsidiarity , the safe@@ keeping of our agricultural systems , the construction of a more humane Europe in the field of employment , a more generous Europe - are such that we must accept them together .
It is unthinkable to see the development of a Europe of ever stricter health and environmental rules on the one hand , and of areas exempt from all legislation on the other .
Mr President , like all my fellow Members who spoke before me , I would pay tribute to the quality of the work done by Mrs Krehl , and I should like to join with her in emphasising the major importance of the objective of territorial cohesion , which I think is crucial to the future of our European Union .
Legisl@@ ators - and I have almost finished speaking now - cannot regulate everything , but they must occasionally remind everyone what their rights and duties are .
We are thereby affirming our will to innovate and to strengthen our universities so that they once again become the centres of excellence that they have the potential to be and so that they contribute to making a reality the Europe of knowledge , which still exists in theory only .
Culture is not just another commodity .
However , the measures adopted by the 14 Member States on 31 January , which are going to be re@@ assessed , or , at least , which are due to be re@@ assessed in the light of the report of the Wise Men , are of a strictly bilateral nature .
First of all , on 28 January , the Ecofin Council concluded a political agreement to extend the experimental reduced VAT rate on labour @-@ intensive services until 2010 .
In particular , it is of prime importance that testing and treatment are done as early as possible , and that anti @-@ retro@@ viral drugs are made available at an affordable price .
Indeed , while the causes have been identified : poverty , social exclusion , unemployment , the lack of border controls allowing the development of underground networks of all kinds of organised crime , violence against women , education , the explosion of pornography or the disappearance of moral reference points , the solutions proposed in this report are very vague , general and incomplete .
However , at least there was one way , Mr President , of solving this dispute and that was by voting .
I think that it is Parliament &apos; s duty to react robu@@ stly .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , first and foremost , I would like to say , dear Nicole , that I understand how you must be feeling today .
A reduction in VAT rates would also allow many establishments to adjust working hours .
But perhaps the opponents of the communist regime , the believers , Christians , Bu@@ ddhis@@ ts , and others , persecuted , would not here be considered as humans .
Why do we send intervention forces to combat ethnic cleansing for certain peoples and do nothing to protect the Palestinian people ?
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance has requested that the item on &quot; Venezuela &quot; be replaced by a new point on &quot; T@@ em@@ elin &quot; .
It will be passed on .
The amendments proposed by the PPE @-@ DE Group are no less regrettable .
In this connection , I am pleased with the progress we were already able to make , even before adoption of the draft budget at first reading by the Council , in bringing together the points of view of the institutions .
I am entirely open to any comments , ideas or suggestions on the subject .
So today , not long before the end of this mandate , we would really like to stress that Sierra Leone , one of the poorest countries in the world , which has really succeeded in establishing this Special Court to try those responsible for the atrocities , should be supported .
Mr President , Commissioner , you have a difficult task ahead of you because I can see that opinions will differ greatly on both sides .
The Union should be a credible player on the international stage but also a free partner of the United States within the Atlantic Alliance . That is the key message of this report , and that is why I shall support it .
Finally , the third proposal , which appears in Mr Sterckx &apos; s report , has the merit of covering domestic services , while providing for a system of temporary exemption .
If , within that period , Parliament adopts a resolution , the Commission will have to re @-@ examine its draft measures .
This attack comes on top of a series of grave events , all of which were religi@@ ously motivated .
Now that our people have rejected the superstate , has the time therefore not come to tell Europeans the truth ?
In 2004 , the European Commission opened up a discussion on a new form of European company , designed more specifically for small and medium @-@ sized undertakings : the European Private Company .
France intends , in this way , to show that it is still aware of its historic commitments and the European Parliament should have been able to support this act of responsibility .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we remember the WHO appeal launched on 5 October 2006 , challenging the international community to improve air quality .
We have analysed the mediator &apos; s recommendations and our analysis is that the quota of 25 000 tonnes in question will not have a significant impact on imports from the ACP countries or on imports from other countries which also benefit from generalised preferences .
If we refuse to work with moderate Islamists , however , we will just be stuck with the radicals and the extremists , and it is not just in Palestine that they will make their voices heard !
In his view , those seeking asylum , refugees and migrants all form part of European society both now and in the future .
Is he going to play the lotter@@ y or what ?
The European message has changed : it has become richer and more complex .
What must be done at national level ?
Matters would be made worse still if the negotiating mandate included investment among the WTO &apos; s competencies , as this would risk the revival of the Multi@@ lateral Agreement on Investment ( MAI ) , of infamous memory .
When a policy drives farmers to suicide , when it leads men to deliberately destroy the fruits of their lab@@ ours because that is no worse than what the policy is offering them , it is time to change the policy .
. Since part of paragraph 15 has been retained , I voted for the S@@ ten@@ mar@@ ck report on the European Parliament &apos; s preliminary draft estimates for 2003 .
Admittedly , the system could be improved : it must be made more open and the developing countries must be more fully integrated .
Two @-@ thirds of the way through , it is clear that many least developed countries ( LDCs ) will be unable to achieve any of the goals of eradicating poverty , of providing access to education and health care , and that most developing countries will be far from achieving them too .
I am keen to inform you that the current programme , the Euromed cultural programme , still has an allocation of EUR 15 million for this year .
We also want to see partnerships implemented with the countries of origin and transit , based above all on respect for both fundamental rights and the right of asylum .
Our group believes that identities need to be clearly defined and recognised before normal and constructive relations can be established with Turkey .
Firstly , the intransigent attitude of the Renault bosses should give some food for thought to a few francop@@ hile politicians who dream of attach@@ ing Wall@@ onia to France .
Let us do like the WTO then ; it works for the WTO .
HIV is to be treated as a transmissible but non @-@ contagi@@ ous disease , and any restrictions on freedom of access , travel and residence for HIV positive people , because of their HIV status , are counterproductive .
In addition , it places different areas on an equal footing . Both at a European level and at the level of each Member State , public authorities should take resolute action on railways .
In all these cases , if the software programs had been free , the whole of Africa could immediately have benefited from them , for instance in the fields of teaching or medicine .
It is true that , as far as the European budget is concerned , the worst offences are committed when we pour money outside the continent of Europe : EUR 10 million for Central Asia , EUR 14@@ .5 million for the displaced people of Latin America , EUR 4 million for human rights in South Africa and Timor etc . , etc . That would be all well and good if , at the same time , we were not planning to cut EUR 5 million from appropriations for our beekeepers who face competition from adulter@@ ated honey from abroad .
We have risen to the challenge and we are working towards an agreement at first reading .
Offici@@ ally , this fund enables the European Union to finance concrete actions to offset the effects of the crisis .
In particular , we approve of the ambition to achieve full employment as well as its ambition in terms of sound social and , above all , salary agreements .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to come back to the interparliamentary encounter between the Pan @-@ African and European Parliaments to comment on two points where a common vision is needed within a common strategy .
The rapid reaction force set up by the countries of Europe is a good idea , provided that its democratic control , its variable geometry and the freedom of engagement of the members are better respected than they are at the moment , as can already be said .
That concludes the agenda .
The presidencies succeed one another ; the problems remain .
3 .
I am very attached to this quest for read@@ ability , proximity and explanation by the Commission in the field for which I am responsible .
The same is true of the states which have maintained links with western powers by means of economic agreements of this type .
In my report , I develop the consequences of demographic change , i.e. the shr@@ inking of the active population , the growing number of elderly people , and the demographic imbalances between different regions of Europe .
I am thinking about Al@@ as@@ ka , for example .
In this context , we have taken several cooperation measures enabling us to put security measures in place , for example for the European Fo@@ ot@@ ball Cham@@ pion@@ ship which took place in Portugal last year .
Mr President , our group did not vote in favour of Mr Wynn &apos; s report granting the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget for 1994 .
Po@@ st @-@ market infrastructures do indeed play a fundamental part in the proper conclusion of transactions .
Finally , we have prepared a statement for the European Council on the specific economic , social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social functions in Europe .
The recovery plan is essentially a to@@ ol@@ box to promote restructuring .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report , which ensures greater transparency .
It has constructed a vast network of partnerships around the world with a clear commitment to re @-@ establishing relations .
In particular , the question of fairness of contributions to the Community budget was raised .
C@@ and@@ our is a mark of friendship and Europe takes a strong stance of talking about Mr Sakharov in the K@@ rem@@ lin .
This idea was approved by Parliament in 1997 in the wake of my report on assisting spouses in family businesses , but it still has not been embrac@@ ed by the Commission .
We agree with his conclusions , by the terms of which the discharge to be given to the Commission in respect of the clearance of the 1992 EAGGF accounts will be postponed and made subject to certain conditions .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we will not be able to say that we did not know about the tragedy unfolding in Chechnya .
I would like to mention a number of them : the commercial use of CO2 capture and storage , the doubling of the production capacity of the largest wind farms , the commercial maturity of photovolta@@ ic or ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ic solar energy , sustain@@ ably produced second @-@ generation biofuels , the introduction onto the public market of mechanisms allowing more efficient end use of energy in construction , transport and industry , the crucial advances in the energy efficiency of materials , bi@@ osci@@ ences and information technologies .
The fact that some of the problems in the Comoros have worsened and have been repeated is very probably because the existence of some populations with their own crises and their own problems , particularly on the island of An@@ jou@@ an but also on the island of Mo@@ h@@ √©l@@ i , was not taken sufficiently into account .
You say that we should continue op@@ en@@ cast mining in Europe because there is a supply problem .
Surely the doubly courageous fight of Algerian women should be recognised , since they are the main victims of terrorism yet , at the same time , still subjected to a family code which flouts their most basic rights ?
No prisoner has escaped or tried to do so .
There are other examples , and this is a very important undertaking .
Even if the Council and the Commission were to end up accepting the amendments tabled , however , and at the moment they are rejecting them and di@@ thering , that would not acqu@@ it the leaders of the European institutions of the massive responsibility for the propagation of BSE they incurred by refusing to take precautionary measures as soon as the threat represented by that endemic disease became tangible .
Indeed , the Commission will take into account the results of this mid @-@ term review of the fifth programme , as well as the results of the independent assessment of the last five years , in formulating the strategic guidelines for the future , i.e. for the preparation of the sixth programme .
The new Article 8@@ a , proposed by the rapporteur , does provide certain guarantees , but the wording of this clause must be tightened up in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and IT@@ U rules .
The deu@@ tsch@@ mark is fo@@ isted on Kosovo , and the law of the market prevails .
Well , far from finding peace again , the Timo@@ re@@ se are now suffering a real tragedy .
This debate is very useful because it underlines the political nature of the move towards greater security by showing Europeans , starting with the political authorities , where their responsibilities lie . It is their responsibility to consider from now on that the European Union is pre@@ destined .
Given that we will be represented at the WTO conference in Canc√∫n next week , I would first like to mention the connection with the General Agreement on Trade in Services .
In fact , and as a matter of principle , all passengers must be equal before the law .
Everything should therefore balance out in the end .
More and more , the work that needs to be done is that on combating climate change and on pursuing a coherent energy policy and a Europe that is not only more competitive but that also derives its strength from a sustainable economy marked by solidarity - all of which presupposes , of course , greater investment in innovation .
In the United States , a debate has been taking place in the wake of the Enron affair on the need to increase the resources allocated to the Securities and Ex@@ change Commission .
Apart from its repercussions on farmers &apos; incomes , this agreement in no way prepares for the next WTO negotiations , or perhaps , without saying so , it prepares for them too well .
We want to integrate countries in which agriculture and exports are very important into the European Union , even though they have not to date adopted the Community acquis .
Unfortunately , this potentially lethal counterfeiting is not widely known about and , in the majority of cases , goes almost un@@ re@@ marked .
To dare to say that the French 35 @-@ hour law is responsible for the fall in the euro because it has weakened European competitiveness overall is an intellectual lie , pure and simple .
Mr President , there is essentially nothing surprising about the situation today .
The result of this collective step forward is undeniably constructive , because it leads to three important ideas , and I can tell you , on behalf of the Commission , that this is how we regard them , and I shall now comment briefly on each one .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like a different voice to be heard in this Chamber .
For all these reasons and more besides , I cannot vote in favour of this initiative to create what I would describe as just yet another labyr@@ in@@ th@@ ine system .
As you can see , and we cannot get into a discussion on this , I too looked at what my predecessors did in similar situations because case law does , righ@@ tfully , exist .
If Europe now arouses fears among a growing number of our fellow citizens , it is because its institutions have not sufficiently borne in mind their worries about a seemingly uncertain and menac@@ ing future .
The report highlights a number of factors that exacerbated the situation : livestock farming and the agri @-@ food sector were subject to the demands of importers and exporters and the race for world market domination ; European sanitary directives were not transposed into national legislation ; veterinary border controls were sometimes insufficient , despite the tremend@@ ously high value of the interests at risk ; and there has been a continuous reduction in the number of veterinary sur@@ geons .
We are living in exceptional times , and they call for exceptional measures .
Very little has been done .
Therefore , we can and we must be inven@@ tive , we must be intelligent and we must say things clearly .
. The &apos; European Cap@@ itals of Culture &quot; programme was launched in 1985 with the aim of bringing European citizens closer together .
In fact , I wanted to specify that for Europe the ACP group is not currently a real partner in the political dialogue , and that this dialogue lacks content and visibility .
Napolitano report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 23 / 2002 )
The next item is the report by Mrs Napoletano , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the Barcelona Process : Union for the Mediterranean .
Mr President , I too congratulate the rapporteur on his report . This report is about the future - which makes a change from the debates we were having earlier - and , in particular , about relations between the Council , the Commission and the European Parliament with a view to greater democratisation of our institutions .
In my view , therefore , cancelling third world debt , Commissioner , and helping development with a good governance policy appear to be solutions that we must not disregard if we want to have a fairer and more humane immigration policy .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , Belarus is at a crossroads .
In@@ sufficient information has been provided for farmers ; risk criteria have been used very in@@ frequently ; the management , control and reduction system is too complicated ; insufficient consideration has been given to cases of minor non @-@ compliance ; control rates are not harmonised ; prior notification of controls poses a problem .
Thirdly , and this is the question that I believe needs to be discussed most urgently , the need for coordinated action to stimulate the global economy and minimise the consequences of the crisis for the jobs and purchasing power of our fellow citizens .
Parliament really does have the will to coordinate legislation .
After the electoral fraud last year which allowed General Eyadema to hold on to power , we are right to be worried about the democratic intentions of this regime .
Objec@@ tors tell us that it will only be effective if it is global , but make a start we must , as some countries have done with the tax on flight tickets .
Small @-@ scale corruption will only disappear with economic development .
The decoupling of aid : here too , we have found a position that , in my view , is balanced .
Generally speaking , the fundamental question that the new , and rapidly deteriorating , economic circumstances raise and indeed force us to consider is , in my view , the following : what sort of political creativity can we come up with in order to avoid serious tension arising in all our societies even between some of the Member States , and , more importantly , with the candidate countries ?
The welfare of animals in general and of laying hens in particular is a serious business .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what strikes a new Member , such as myself , on joining the European Parliament , and the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , is that there is no coherent vision with regard to culture in Europe .
The Heads of State and Government did not make our task any easier . It was a mandate under which we were unable to create new rights or develop any of the Union &apos; s responsibilities , and which some parties sought to interpret as a straightforward licence to trans@@ cri@@ be certain articles from the European Convention on Human Rights .
If the EU @-@ Africa summit is not to be in vain , it should succeed in confronting real problems .
However , in its current wording , we cannot vote for this , since it is too restrictive and limits supervision to the parent company alone .
It imposes a different attitude towards ageing .
By voting in favour of this resolution , we are saying loud and clear that we wish to put a stop to the difference in treatment suffered by homosexuals on EU soil and to see them guaranteed the same rights .
It is also reasonable that the agency should produce regular reports on the results of its actions .
Thus , in France and Italy , we have a commitment to reduce working hours .
The Echelon system , as some colleagues have clearly explained , particularly Mr Sainjon , is a system for intercep@@ ting computer and telephone communications which covers the entire world , and which allows the Americans to carry out global surveillance .
We should push each other in a certain direction , and this means dialogue between murderers .
Mr President , the situation in Angola is extremely serious , and the resumption of the civil war is particularly worrying .
Those of us who are local council@@ lors living in the day @-@ to @-@ day world of relocation , and the upro@@ oting , the collapse of the structure of areas , the massive job losses , the economic and social destabili@@ zation it causes , will not recognize it in this simplistic and nai@@ vely idylli@@ c report .
I myself believe that this complexity , or at least part of it , should be assumed and explained by each of our institutions , because this complex aspect is the price we have to pay in order to have a Europe which is united without being , at the same time , uniform .
I did so for many reasons , not least because some people are levelling particularly unfair accusations against the candidate .
What can I say about your personal qualities and your already long record in the quest for European integration ?
Thus , the European maritime administrations will be able to set an example .
The technical details are to be fin@@ alized at the Dublin Council , which is a concern raised in the motion for a resolution .
The question of food prices has been raised and it is true that the rise in food prices will certainly affect Latin America , where over a third of the population is already living in poverty .
Or@@ d@@ inary people expect Europe to be attentive to their concerns , and companies expect Europe to implement a policy that will counter widespread social dumping .
This Anglo @-@ Saxon model is a model of the invisible hand , but it is really the visible hand of capitalism .
That is no longer tolerable given the high degree of integration we have achieved , with the launch of the euro and the arrival of a multipolar world .
We have to evaluate it objectively and luci@@ dly and imagine what it will be like during the new period from 2007 to 2013 or 2011 .
The questions are also professional .
Madam President , on looking at the Council conclusions , I am struck by something .
Since this is a guarantee , it should be interpreted in a broader sense .
In the context of an agreement with the United States , the rapporteur emphasised the extent to which this country lacked any legally binding standard on personal data protection .
If the question should eventually arise as to whether the provisions of paragraph 19 are to be proposed and trans@@ cri@@ bed into international reality , then we shall discuss the matter again , but as far as the Treaty on European Union is concerned , this hypothetical situation cannot be taken into consideration at this stage .
Our National Assembly has just adopted in second reading an immigration bill providing that any foreigner who leaves French territory must hand in his residence permit to the police services .
To mention only a few issues , let us turn first to the question of the financing of terrorism .
They are the conversion into specific negotiation documents of political guidelines that were drawn up in December 2000 , following discussions with the other European institutions - the Council and Parliament .
1957 @-@ 2007 .
Public television is not a monopoly and should not be one .
This does not mean that those in charge must be above ordinary mort@@ als .
Mr President , I would like to emphasise the quality of the work carried out by your three committees : the Committee on Legal Affairs - Mr Casini is here ; the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs - Mr L√≥pez A@@ guil@@ ar is here ; and also the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
Mr President , Mrs Leh@@ tom@@ √§ki , Mr Barroso , we are deeply dist@@ ressed and outraged by the assassination of Anna Polit@@ kov@@ sk@@ aya , and we have many questions about the reasons that led to this crime being carried out .
It is precisely in order to prevent the Internet from becoming a lawless area that the Democratic Movement &apos; s delegation considers that termin@@ ating Internet access should not be an administrative decision but a judicial decision .
This strategy is disastrous for Georgia , for the Caucasus and for Europe .
Although science shows that the use of adult stem cells rend@@ ers the use of embryonic cells pointless , scientific thinking is determined to violate the &apos; sanc@@ ti@@ ty of life &apos; by promoting the exploitation of the human embryo .
It is clear that nothing has been done .
In other words , this will involve assessing , for each individual case , the need for such a clause .
This does not mean that basic research and research in general should not be pursued in areas other than implementing ITER , as you rightly stressed , for example on J@@ E@@ T and other types of to@@ k@@ ama@@ k , such as the st@@ el@@ lar@@ ator .
Finally , for reasons of fair competition with third countries , I consider it is justified to compensate for the removal of Article 23 on price leadership by the possibility of imposing restrictions , when a third country with which an agreement has been signed does not recognise the same duties .
What results has the GSP + shown ?
Competition between them over processing transactions will intensify as the European financial market becomes more integrated .
A tele@@ gram from the Agence France @-@ P@@ resse dated yesterday 17 September inform@@ s us that according to the leaders of the three opposition parties - Ford @-@ Kenya , Ford @-@ Asi@@ li and the democratic party - acts of violence are being committed by Islamic extremists in the region of M@@ omb@@ asa on the Indian Ocean and are spreading terror by burning homes and tourist centres because alcohol is consumed there .
We should have done so a long time ago , but we have finally got round to it today .
As far as developing countries are concerned , the European Union is already achieving a great deal in the area of health with the development fund , and this is a topic to which the Commission will continue to pay full attention in the future .
The Socialists condemn this violence and do not recognise the power in place as having any legitimacy .
We must look again at the unacceptable issues in relation to responsibility - because , if the rules of ordinary law concerning responsibility were applied , we would not have these problems . We must also look again at the application of rules of ordinary law concerning the right of European citizens to information , which , under present conditions , the system that has been introduced clearly does not safeguard .
Parliament is in fact divided , in part .
It also hopes that Parliament will continue to take part in international meetings .
The Member States will have to show themselves worthy of each others &apos; confidence and the confidence of the Commission , the guarantor of the Treaties , by the care they take in exercising the controls for which they are responsible .
What I want to say is that all those who support the idea of a European monitoring centre agree on its mission and its form .
Now then is the time for straight talking before things once again spiral out of control and thus give another chance to those who fish in troubled waters .
The European Union needs to strive for radical changes in the World Trade Organisation and to work more closely with the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) so as to return to cooperation systems that include variable customs duties at the border .
The first aim is to restore our seas and oceans to a good ecological status .
We therefore need to have a forward @-@ looking vision and not just appease our consciences by saying : the debt is reduced or cancelled ; now let them get on with it .
In the short term , however , one of its unavoidable effects has been a severe drop in GDP , of 8 % this year , which may have serious social consequences .
However , the efforts that have been made in this project are , I think , up to the task .
Not only will the review of the Television without Frontiers Directive not take place , but what is more , at the same time , other parties are proposing to set up a television channel in Europe for broadcasting films .
With the creation of this young state , what was previously considered an internal matter for Sudan has become an international affair .
It would thus im@@ pel us towards a standardised Europe , the like of which most political leaders claim they reject .
The primary challenges are security , reaching inhabitants in distress and respect for humanitarian principles .
Mr President , if I have understood you correctly , you are inviting me to reply to the oral question .
Similarly , I do not agree with Amendment No 4 , which was rejected and which eliminated what is known as &apos; development risk &apos; , nor , finally , with Amendment No 7 , which aimed to eliminate the limitation period of 10 years from the date on which the product is put on the market .
Rural development , the technological mastery of fields and of the environment , the gradual increasing of yields , the fight against diseases - all are possibilities to be exploited with methods which are modern and more natural and , above all , easier to control .
I therefore agree that in general we should recognise the significance of these migratory phenomena by giving them greater consideration when we are formulating the European Union &apos; s external policy .
Priority must be given to the social , rather than military , budgets .
In countries still subject to a high degree of corruption , where the legal frameworks are still un@@ reliable and democracy is uncertain , the World Bank unfortunately is doing nothing to encourage sustainable development .
The fact that this is not discussed is not , therefore , a problem in itself .
I should point out that 3 % of the Burmese GNP comes from this forced labour .
I turn now to Mrs Wallis , who very much emphasised this need to modernise the way in which justice works , and it is true that the action plan that has just been adopted under the French Presidency is of huge interest to the Czech Presidency .
On the climate change package , we were strong and we took the lead , and it is true that , even if it was not enough , as we were told at the time , the &apos; 3@@ x@@ 20 &apos; was just right .
A directive exists on transparency , which establishes the deadlines for setting the price and for the reimbursement for medicines .
This applies to the fields of police and justice and to the field of common foreign and security policy .
That is why I voted in favour of this resolution , which seeks to ensure that the strategic nature of the issue is recognised .
He had gained a favourable impression from his meeting , which augu@@ rs well for the negotiations , due to start on 30 October , being conducted in a constructive spirit .
The same goes for another Commissioner , that is , the Commissioner nominated by the Hungarian Government .
The European Parliament barely even defends what is an unsatisfactory social status quo and has confined itself to perpetu@@ ating the image of a bureaucratic Europe in the pocket of major financial interests .
It also recognises that national governments have the right to define general interest , but it is the Commission and , in the final analysis , the Court that determine the extent to which derogations may be made .
And lastly , Article 7a is not entirely unambiguous - although , contrary to what Mrs Roth just said , it was accompanied by an explanatory statement - and in any event , it must be interpreted sensi@@ bly .
However , recent events in Bahrain have given rise to concerns as to whether the report is sufficiently up @-@ to @-@ date .
Lastly , this decision , if approved under the conditions that I have just mentioned , will have to be accompanied by significantly stricter controls to combat illegal fishing .
Firstly , you say that there is no point in calling into question the foundations of Economic and Monetary Union .
We need to make things quite clear here : we do have the tools , at Community level , to combat discrimination .
Yet , in &apos; real life &quot; , it is in fact large companies &quot; attempts to maximise their profits that cru@@ sh small subcontractors .
The results achieved to date are positive but , as yet , insufficient .
This proposed directive concerns national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants and comes under the framework directive on air quality .
We do not think that this v@@ indic@@ tive resolution - which is viru@@ l@@ ently anti @-@ American in its form , f@@ lawless in its substance ( 4 and 13 : what a brilliant idea - the secret services are to make their operations public ! ) and often un@@ readable - improves our image among Europeans .
The third issue that we must address as part of our new efforts is European and national laws .
I have not been a Member long enough to know what Rule allows the French Socialists to join in the praise for your work on behalf of us all .
The model proposed by the Friedrich report allows one vote per member within the Governing Council , thereby giving the impression that it respects equality between the Member States .
I am , of course , thinking of the cultural dimension , which has been pointed out , but also of spectrum use for public service purposes - we should actually have a discussion about civil protection services - and indeed for military purposes .
Furthermore , this lack of transparency allows national or private lobbies to prevail over the Community or general interest .
Consequently , I am asking the MEPs from the PPE and UEN to subscribe to the serious attitude we need to adopt on this matter and with regard to the Uzbek people , and support our motion for a resolution , which says nothing more than the truth about the human rights situation in Uzbekistan .
The Belgian Presidency strengthened the role of employment policies in the Europe 2020 strategy , it ensured that these policies would have a place in the new economic governance of Europe , and I believe that it also created the foundations for the social dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy , not only the fight against poverty , but also social cohesion .
Since , however , we are completely opposed to the motivation of this approach , we did not vote in favour of it either .
I would like to conclude with a few words on the general philosophy that underlies this proposal : our group supported the free provision of services , and in particular of cross @-@ border services .
The report by my colleague Mrs Roure falls firmly within this second category , since the protection of personal data is one of its key components .
Temporary workers have more accidents than other workers and suffer more harassment .
Next , we should take care not to make access to capital for firms , especially the smallest ones , even more complicated .
Through these requirements and these desires expressed by the European Parliament , it is indeed a question of developing the Union into a real political community .
I hope that the French Presidency will take due account of this issue , which we consider to be extremely important .
As far as we are concerned , we are ready for a debate that leaves no stone un@@ turned , whether it focuses on the crimes of Stalin@@ ism , on the German @-@ Soviet Pact of ble@@ ak memory , or further still on the history of the Baltic States .
Two guidelines call explicitly on the Member States and the social partners to work towards this .
Now , if pilotage has been , on the surface of it , preserved from unbridled competition , the freedom given to each state seems to us to be too great and to contradict the notion of public service , a characteristic that the services in question are acknowledged as poss@@ essing , whether by the states themselves or by the Court of Justice of the European Union .
Furthermore , the fact that a mechanism exists in the United States for granting space segment licences will give rise to discrimination against systems of non @-@ US origin .
It means 3@@ 10 million added to be added to reserves .
Secondly , the Commission has not seen fit to publish the amount of anti@@ vir@@ als currently available in each of the Member States .
There are plenty of previous examples of companies in difficulties being told to axe hundreds of jobs , failing which they will have to pay back the aid they need to survive .
In this area , we analysed all the processes , as I have already explained and the Commission launched a new infringement procedure against Italy in July 1999 .
We must allow the Commission to present a systematic analysis of the evolution of the European economy before breaking it down country by country .
As you frequently remind us , common foreign policy must fulfil the global objectives of the European Union which are defined , in particular , in Article 3 of the Treaty , and where the elimination of poverty features promin@@ ently .
( The vote took place ) The result of this vote according to the election officers here behind me is 2@@ 54 votes .
Moreover , in my report , I invite the European Commission to present some very ambitious legislative proposals for the creation of a European protection force , and I am pleased at the recent communication by the Commission on strengthening the European Union &apos; s disaster response capabilities .
For a parliament to want to become a kind of governing assembly would not be compatible with the high principle of democracy .
On the same subject , the Commission is hoping to strengthen the visibility of the European Community &apos; s numerous cultural actions .
I had addressed a written question ...
Mr President , I note here the fairness with which you chair these debates .
You cannot be a member of the Schengen area and regularise without informing the other countries because regularisation in one country has an impact on all the others in the Schengen area .
But how can we possibly think that these efforts suffice , when these pre@@ cep@@ ts of times gone by , which victi@@ mise and condemn millions of citizens from the day they are born , continue to apply ?
That did not mean that we voted in favour , however , because in reality the report does not stand up against the exploitation of the Congo , but solely against the exploitation that it describes as illegal .
Within the EU , national legislation varies from one Member State to another .
These are the reasons for the high quality of the report you compiled , which was adopted unanimously by the Parliamentary Committee on Transport and Tourism .
Ph@@ ilosop@@ h@@ y and history teach us that any compromise of the respect for the human being leads ines@@ capa@@ bly to its negation .
Can Italy , following police violence in Genoa , or Sweden , after police violence in Gothenburg , give Israel appropriate lessons in maintaining public order ?
This commitment now needs to be translated into reality , because that is not always the case .
With regard to energy , the G@@ CC is the European Union &apos; s leading oil supplier , so the EU is highly dependent on these countries , but their oil reserves are d@@ wind@@ ling and they are preparing their transition thanks to the development of renewable energy .
Re@@ thinking our fight against terrorism means dealing with its roots in poverty , exclusion , discrimination , in a word , all injustice .
He has proved himself on the energy and climate package and he has enabled Europe to become the world &apos; s pioneer in the fight against global warming .
The situation is really extremely serious .
Techn@@ ically , of course , he is proposing , as always , the great mass , the sixteen regulations on wine , por@@ k , f@@ lax , etc , with price free@@ zes at the centre and a reduction in compensatory amounts for major crops , i.e. 7 % less for cereals , 4 % less for oil seeds , 26 % for set @-@ asi@@ des , proposals all made to make cereal farmers bear the costs of mistakes made by British industrialists .
Furthermore , as regards fundamental research , it is absolutely necessary that there is a clearer proposal on this field , in the Seventh Framework Programme , that also takes into consideration the current debate in the scientific community on the European Research Council .
Besides , we know that empi@@ ri@@ cally dividing the adult dose to treat children has already led to tragedy in the past .
In order to combat fundamentalist terrorism , we should mainly focus our efforts on increased assistance to all supporters of moderate and tolerant Islam , whether they be in power or in opposition .
The Commission will take all the initiatives required for an ongoing and fruitful dialogue at all levels , including amongst the Presidents of the institutions , in order to draw up a common plan that will allow for the necessary decisions to be taken .
We act as a lever for implementing these measures and we ensure that we work with the banking sector to improve its competence by training bankers to develop these techniques .
As I recall , a year ago we were all very happy - even pleased with ourselves .
Madam President , I would like a little attention from our colleagues , because my intervention is actually based on Article 108 of the regulation concerning a personal detail .
Because they think that OLAF is an excuse to recruit yet another team of officials , costing more than the cost of the fraud itself .
Concerning the question about the European Union and its dis@@ interested approach to basic research , I do not feel that this is the case .
I have referred the matter back to the compet@@ ency of the Commission .
Perhaps we need to wait for complete chaos or for the euro to disappear .
That is why I shall vote in its favour .
Our partners in Latin America ask us : how did you pull it off ?
I am therefore very pleased about the reports on customs codification by our fellow Members and friends , Mrs Fourtou and Mr Audy , particularly because , since 19@@ 19 in the case of Germany , 19@@ 34 @-@ 35 for France , 1938 for Mexico , and so on , we had lost our codi@@ fying ambition .
This is why the Europe of free movement is a Europe that deprives people who are permanent residents in favour of nom@@ ads .
By this we mean expenditure for the implementation of the Kyoto Agreement .
For example , at our last meeting of the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg , I personally informed each minister , in writing , of Parliament &apos; s position regarding each of the items we had to discuss within the Council .
These are two distinct notions , because , according to econom@@ etri@@ cs , monetary decisions have a delayed reaction on actual developments of something in the region of 12 to 18 months .
The timid approach that is the root of many obstacles in the field of free movement of persons must give way to a wider vision that focuses on the requirements of the vast area of freedom , security and justice to which a great majority of us aspire .
Until these conditions are consolidated by the WTO , they are not considered obligatory from the point of view of the WTO and , consequently , countries which , for one reason or another , have been obliged to accept or have accepted conditions of this type from the IMF may use this advantage in the WTO negotiations .
For the Russian state to be able to exist at all , for it to be able to play its proper role , it must , above all , have a financial basis and clear law .
I believe that we share the same interest and , as for the joint EU @-@ Mexico parliamentary committee , we can also see that it is in operation and its next meeting will take place at the end of March .
The best solution would be before the start of the Belgian Presidency , since our assistants work in Belgium .
How strange that the Commission should lose its instin@@ ct for self @-@ preservation just as Europe is integrating .
This is why the Member States must sign or ratify the protocol on this fund as quickly as possible .
Secondly , Spain and Poland &quot; s opposition over the method of calculating the qualified majority was in fact motivated by profound differences , which were shared by other States although they did not say so openly : the rejection of a unitary Europe run supranation@@ ally by a coop@@ ted elite .
The banks will also be tested on the basis of an upper capital threshold , core tier one .
This illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of our debate , in which we have bit@@ ten off more than we can che@@ w . We should therefore focus on these two subjects .
In this context , we must welcome the agreement on wines which has been made between the European Union and the United States and which concludes the first phase of negotiations that were begun 20 years ago .
We do not want to hear once again , Mr President , that Europe must have a foreign policy .
( The President noted that there was no objection to the oral amendment )
There must be periodic campaigns targeted at specific populations or consumers in general in order to highlight aspects relating to , for instance , food safety , traceability , nutritional quality , the specific characteristics of production methods , or indeed the efforts made to promote animal welfare .
Rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , last March I already had occasion to say that as a Frenchman , I was and still am in favour of a highly voluntarist policy on energy .
All of this is in violation of the Treaties themselves , and in violation of the Act of 1976 , which provides for the election of MEPs by direct universal suffrage .
As my colleague Mr Souchet highlighted in his speech , our group voted in favour of all the amendments tabled to this report , except for Amendments Nos 12 , 13 and 15 by the Committee on the Environment .
The very existence of the oldest human rights le@@ ague in Africa and the Arab @-@ speaking world , the Tunisian League , is under threat , despite being recognised by President Ben Ali .
In the opposite corner are those who regard public service and competition as incompatible .
We are aware , from the speeches made by President Chirac in this place in July , that at least three major topics stand out , namely the simplification of the Treaties , the sharing of jurisdiction between European , national and regional levels , what I might term the rights of states in the American expression ( Section 10 of the American Constitution ) , and , thirdly , the balance between the institutions - though here we should especially , perhaps , consider the role of the national parliaments - i.e. how is our institution to be managed in future .
This target was recognised by the European Parliament and by the Council .
In this respect , I would like to draw attention to two specific points , which I think are extremely indicative of the spirit and the methods which pre@@ dominate within the Union &apos; s institutions .
The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Somalia .
It is because the European Union &quot; s products will be based to a greater extent on technology , know @-@ how and eco @-@ innovation that they will find their place in the world markets .
- Mr President , Commissioner , what our fellow citizens require is high quality information and they are waiting for us to take the initiative and to tell them clearly how things stand .
Last June , for various reasons and in spite of reservations on the situation in the country regarding political stability and respect for human rights , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party approved the implementation of this agreement .
I do not want them all to be put on the same footing .
Mr President , I should like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to all my colleagues who were involved in this report ; this truly is a collective piece of work .
I am not calling here for American @-@ style deficits ...
These institutional dig@@ ressions are not meant to reassure the citizens , who cannot make sense of it .
Nor is it legitimate to per@@ vert parliamentary procedures in the way that this motion of censure does , to use sophis@@ try and insinu@@ ation and impu@@ g@@ n people &quot; s motives without any evidence .
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series .
While it is crucial for the European Union &apos; s expenditure to be guided by the United Nations , these difficulties lead to the conclusion that the European Union must equip itself with an autonomous , integrated structure with the means to deal with tasks as complex as a humanitarian emergency .
To this end , our policy on support for European research should give priority to these areas .
Mrs O@@ vi@@ ir , your fan club has stayed to the end .
I am also particularly pleased to learn that Mr N@@ gar@@ le@@ j@@ y Yor@@ ong@@ ar is in Strasbourg at the moment and may have met some of you , but I am obviously still concerned about the fate of I@@ b@@ ni Ou@@ mar Ma@@ ham@@ at Saleh , who is still missing .
But decisions taken in the past should not prevent all political reflection in the present per se .
The States must mobilise themselves against the hate that is re @-@ emerging on their soil .
Everyone - including you , Commissioner , and the European Commission as a whole - recognises the undeniable benefits of organic farming , in terms of the environment , biodiversity and health , but also in terms of employment and rural development .
Negotiations will have to involve Mr Zak@@ ay@@ ev , they will have to involve discussing his proposals and recognising him , and it is only right that the European Union should recognise him and prompt him to abandon and denounce terrorism ; he has to be treated as a political partner , as an enemy with whom it is necessary to negotiate .
That is why I voted against Amendment No 15@@ 5 .
I cannot forget Mr Manuel Barroso and the fact that it is under the impetus of Europe - and Nicolas Sarkozy in particular - that the G20 has been called upon to help restore order to a financial system which has lost the plot .
Without breaking the poverty cycle , in other words without stopping the pillaging of poor countries and the impoverishment of their working populations , even the most well @-@ intentioned speeches will remain speeches , and millions of children in poor countries will continue to be deprived of even a minimum education .
The new regulation makes provision for , among other things : ‚Ä¢ a legal basis between Frontex and the liaison officers ; ‚Ä¢ better use of IC@@ ON@@ et and ; ‚Ä¢ increased rationalisation of the reporting systems pertaining to the network &apos; s activities .
Next , from an economic and financial point of view , the Commission has indeed retained a differentiated strategy , taking into account the extreme diversity among the overseas countries and territories , but I deplore the fact that the amount of aid is essentially fixed based on GNP per inhabitant .
That is why I can announce now that on 26 November 2001 , the first European meeting dedicated to teaching and disabilities will be held at the Senate in Paris , in conjunction with the European A@@ cad@@ emy of Medic@@ ine .
That has been the effect of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
The international framework for regulating the financial sector must be completed , so that it can aid investment , growth and employment .
Madam President , Mr Juncker , Mr Trichet , ladies and gentlemen , it is neither paradoxical nor contradictory to endorse the conclusions of the excellent reports that have been submitted to us and to support the courageous and determined action of the French Government to carry out the necessary reforms and to promote growth .
These programmes , the Socrates and Youth for Europe III programmes , do of course expire at the end of 1999 , so it is therefore not at all certain that young Turks would in fact participate . However , voting in favour of this step does at least mean acting on principle and improving relations in sectors that are essential for Turkey &apos; s future , that is , education and youth .
Similarly for the countries of the third world , the question is knowing whether they will still be able to escape the clu@@ t@@ ches of the me@@ ga @-@ multinationals produced by the me@@ ga @-@ mergers and stay in control of their own development .
You spoke about coherence .
We , on the contrary , call upon the Council to curb these proposals and to reject them whenever they are lax . We once again regret that , on 1 May , the Commission will acquire a monopoly on initiatives in these matters .
These language teachers have worked for the Commission for decades . They have trained various Commissioners in the languages of the various countries , and yet they are being k@@ ic@@ ked out .
In continuation of the REACH regulations , which impose strict controls on the use of chemicals in our consumer goods , I have therefore voted today for an unconditional ban on the use of any toxic substances in the manufacture of toys .
It turns out that there are still two delicate points for us to consider in these negotiations .
On the other hand , we have embarked , together with the NGO liaison committee , on a very thorough debate concerning practical , pragmatic ways of increasing the efficiency both of the Commission and the NGOs .
Thus , Amendments 43 , 44 and 52 really pose problems for me , and I cannot accept them .
Now , it is obvious that this is certainly not about a new directive on services .
We think that , in fact , the proposal in that paragraph to give the poorest small developing countries the chance to receive the proceeds of fines imposed on large developing countries by the WTO is a request that the European Parliament should support .
While seeking to eradicate terrorism , as you have said , Madam President , we must simultaneously make our territories safer in order to better protect our people .
There are other examples too .
Because , apart from the three institutional questions , which are already part of the IGC &apos; s mandate , nobody in the context of the Amsterdam assessment has been able to tell us if the solutions that we had arrived at concerning the operation of this strengthened cooperation were satisfactory .
in writing . - At a time when Europe is faced with a major economic crisis , adopting this report will make it possible to revit@@ alise the services sector by asking Member States to accept a reduced rate of VAT of 5 % on labour @-@ intensive services and locally supplied services .
Lastly , I am not convinced that the wholesale liberalism of the agreement allows for harmonious development of the economies of this State .
I shall conclude with a splendid phrase that I found on a wall in the Basque country and that , I believe , is attributable to G@@ and@@ hi : &apos; There is no path to peace .
How do you intend to get our WTO partners to accept them ?
Globalisation , often discredited , only in fact affects a severely limited number of countries .
What are we to do ?
Fortunately , the risk of inconsistency in such a basis for exclusion was removed by the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
in writing . - I would like to congratulate Mrs Morgan for the initiative she has taken in drawing up a report on the Green Paper presented by the Commission on a European strategy for sustainable , competitive and secure energy .
The European Union has been aware since the beginning of the 1980s , of the need to give the developing countries practical assistance in the fight against HIV @-@ AIDS , putting respect for the people affected , in particular the most vulnerable , at the centre of its concerns .
There is therefore a need to reaffirm the a@@ xi@@ om that we are in a market economy , not a market society .
On these four issues , then , which are simplification of the Treaties , the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the debate on powers and the place of national parliaments in the European architecture , let us be careful not to undermine the Community acquis or weaken the Community method by tackling them in an inappropriate manner .
This , at least , will provide our President with the basis of a clear , explicit and strong intervention to make at the European Council today .
We need to provide determined leadership and reinforced consensus to bring Europe forward together .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President of the Court of Auditors , ladies and gentlemen , this new report from the Court of Auditors which we have just received is of interest to the Committee on Budgetary Control because it makes a number of points concerning the problems of managing the Community budget , while at the same time warning us against the narrow interpretations that could be extracted from the crude exploitation of certain figures .
That means that its beneficiaries must be able to use it easily .
That has now been achieved with EC@@ R@@ IS , which demonstrates that the new technologies are facilitating the day @-@ to @-@ day operation of justice in the Union .
I subscribe to the view expressed in your report that it would be absolutely inappropriate to adopt uniform definitions at the Community level .
So it would be difficult to think of a meal in which bees did not play an important role .
It has never worked in the past , and it will not work in the future !
Two key problems have been overlooked in this report , even though , in the long term , they will determine whether or not the French fishing fleet stays : the unfair competition from non @-@ EU fishing vessels that do not comply with all of the restrictions imposed on our fishermen in matters concerning legislation , control and monitoring , and the cost of fuel ever since Brussels called on France to do away with the fund for the prevention of risks to fishing , or fuel fund .
I am aware of the discussion to which Mr Brok alluded just now , according to which the duties of the High Representative ought to have been allocated to a Vice @-@ President of the Commission .
The Union cannot live hand @-@ to @-@ mouth : it has to have this long @-@ term perspective .
We want to see today &apos; s resolution concentrate exclusively on the problem of Niger .
Hence the need for common principles for recording taxes and social contributions within the Fifteen .
I formulate the problem in these terms , which is how it must be formulated .
Nevertheless the solution , in the end , will depend on the joint capacity of Algerians and Europeans to give back hope to the youth of that country , on the one hand through introducing the necessary social reforms which are required at a socio @-@ economic level , and on the other hand by reinforcing the links which unite them in partnership .
Until this work has been communicated to the Council by the Commission , I am obliged to tell you that we will have to wait for this moment .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - Mr President , Mr Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , I am fortunate to have the opportunity , once again , to talk to this House and , as such , I should like to thank you , on behalf of the Presidency , for the progress made in the field of justice .
No one has asked this question .
Third , Haiti &apos; s development will have to be assessed on the basis of criteria of relevance , effectiveness , efficiency and sustainability .
At this early stage , we would denounce the misappropriation of these funds to benefit the children of wealthy farm owners .
The rapporteur also highlights an incident which occurred at the Belgian Si@@ ren@@ e office , where personal data was stolen .
Great men of State , such as Yitzhak Rabin , understood this , but the Israeli peace forces , who are a credit to that country , are marginalised by the current regime .
Madam President , honourable Members , the Council would obviously like to reiterate that the free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the treaty and secondary legislation deri@@ ving from it , and that this includes the right for citizens of the European Union to live and work in another Member State .
However , I fully understand the motivations behind some of Parliament &apos; s amendments - and moreover the Commission supports these too - particularly the need to improve the degree of citizen participation in European elections and the European make @-@ up of elections to the European Parliament .
We must put a stop to this cowardice .
He repro@@ aches us for having devised the Constitution before having carried out the revolution .
The burden of new procedures will give rise to a whole host of disputes , and the management costs will increase as a result of legal uncertainty .
Thanks to this motion for a resolution , which has found broad consensus , Parliament is taking a firm position .
President Prodi and Mrs Wallstr√∂m went with Mr Verheugen to Prague , and Mr Fischler was also able to observe the extent of the damage in his own country .
You raised the question of the legal bases .
I should like to say to you , as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , that I am delighted to observe that the conditions are in place today for the adoption of this text .
In the face of crisis , Europe has shown that it really exists and has demonstrated its added value .
The creation of the European currency was supposed to stimulate growth , promote employment and strengthen the Union in relation to its main competitors .
Neither the independence of Kosovo nor the arrest of Mr Kar@@ adz@@ ic has caused unrest in the country .
Mr President , I have two questions for the Commissioner .
As an MEP , it was therefore my responsibility to reject an agreement such as this , which runs counter to the idea I have of a great Europe .
( Parliament rejected the request to refer the report back to Committee )
Mr President , I wish to make an oral explanation of vote in order to formally protest against Amendment No 10@@ 05 to the budget , which has just been voted and which provides for the creation of a new budget item entitled &apos; Con@@ tribu@@ tions to European political parties &apos; - obviously to be understood as financial .
I hope , in fact , to provide , in the best possible way , the answers European ports are waiting for , whether in relation to the transparency of tariffs or to the use of infrastructure , to recourse to State aid or , more globally , to the integration of the ports into the intermodal chain .
Because of the dual problem of competitiveness and safety , it is thus important , first of all , to suspend the authorization to import genetically modified products into the European Union , because the national authorities of Member States are not all in agreement and a large majority is even opposed to this .
A Union rolling @-@ stock register will be set up , making it possible to identify the rolling stock , its renewal and ageing , in the same way that this is still carried out , albeit im@@ perfectly , for the maritime fleet .
This facility came about thanks to the political will of our three institutions , and its rapid , effective implementation will clearly require this same shared will .
It would be wrong to draw general conclusions from them .
It was my group that asked for an item concerning the suspension of European Union aid to Palestine to be included on the agenda .
For some , it was a question of reducing the power of the Commission .
Such a basis can be a hazardous one in all sorts of ways , all the more so in view of the character of the &apos; new man &apos; that the &apos; European citizen &apos; is , which is marked by obli@@ vious barbarism , as demonstrated by the refusal of the members of the Convention to make reference in their text to the historic role played by the Christian faith in the real constitution of Europe .
From now on they will be unable to make do with such a feeble budget as the one we are being offered .
The European Union was only pretending to follow the logic of peace .
If we attempt to create a Europe of 25 Member States as the rapporteur suggests , everything will gr@@ ind to a halt .
For example , they would do well to examine how effectively the veterinary controls function in their respective countries .
Firstly , it helps ensure social cohesion thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which lays down rules relating to civic , political and social rights .
I doubt it , if you do not mind me saying so , Commissioner .
Is this acceptable ?
. This resolution proposes to create a new budget to be used for combating mortality during pregnancy and child@@ birth in the poor countries of the world .
We take a very strong line on this , believing that solutions which avoid forcing central banks to out@@ source the management of their accounts would not be good ones .
I@@ de@@ ally , businesses , which are major investors , should have a strategy which goes beyond the horizon of their short @-@ term profits and which would combine economic expansion , social progress and sustainable development .
That was our strategy at first reading , and it won us virtually unanimous support .
I should therefore like to thank you for the European Parliament &apos; s important and comprehensive support of the Commission &apos; s communications on FRONTEX .
For the consumer , the quality of products needs reinforcing , and the taxpayer needs to be reassured that public money is being wisely spent . And our fellow citizens need to be reassured that we are safeguarding regional balances and promoting sustainable development .
In the first place , we can relieve , or indeed cancel , their debts .
One in four people over the age of 65 could be affected in 2020 .
So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter , especially the worrying things which we are discussing , particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain , generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely &apos; sp@@ ic@@ y &apos; matters which we need to go into .
I welcome this report , which makes this argument for public health as indispensable for the common good .
If there are specific problems , then the two @-@ year period may be extended for a further year , but the Member State must incorporate the procedure in full .
This is one of the provisions which we will , of course , be incorporating in our legislative proposal .
An annual conference on economic and employment policy could make a contribution here by checking what results have been achieved and proposing adjustments to employment policies , if necessary with binding quantitative criteria .
The casu@@ alisation of male and female workers is at the heart of the oligarchy &apos; s domination logic , in Europe as elsewhere .
&quot; What has to become democratic is the whole process , from pin@@ pointing the basic problem to implementing and assessing the solution . &quot;
It is true that , as Mr Albertini has said , his report comes at just the right moment .
If it is a game , a wh@@ im , you can say no , but it is business as usual .
On the other hand , and this is in accordance with the position being supported by France , I welcome the fact that the resolution recalls that Turkey &apos; s accession continues to depend on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and on the EU &apos; s capacity for further integration .
Equality between men and women must also be included in all policies in the form of specific and sustainable measures , particularly in the areas of education , training and vocational guidance .
Even so , we must be conscious of the fact that introducing the single currency raises a number of questions about the way it is implemented .
Personally , being heavily involved in following the work of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media and , above all , that of the Conciliation Committee , I am very happy to see this report brought to a conclusion but very sad to note the rigid attitude of Member States who , whilst having fine words to say on the theme of culture as a factor of identity and in the development of jobs , refuse to invest in the theme .
In my opinion , Parliament is misguided in wanting to facilitate these initiatives as much as possible , particularly in reducing the number of Member States from which the signatures must come .
That is quite simply false , and I shall give you a few examples to illustrate my point .
Ex@@ amples of this include the A@@ en@@ e@@ as programme , which funded over 100 projects from 2004 to 2006 , or the Migration and Asylum programme that succeeded it , which was allocated a budget of EUR 20@@ 5 million for the period 2007 @-@ 2010 .
The Taliban have regrou@@ ped in southern Afghanistan and near the border with Pakistan , where they will go to any lengths to try to save , at whatever price , the rem@@ n@@ ants of their power and capacity to inflict harm .
I must put your mind completely at rest , Mr Schulz : the Identi@@ ty , Tradition and So@@ ve@@ reign@@ ty Group most assu@@ re@@ dly does have political content and complies entirely with Parliament &apos; s Rules of Procedure and the case law of the European Court of Justice .
The Commission has taken note of the request to define optional reserved terms , such as &apos; farm &apos; or &apos; mountain &apos; .
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul .
On the contrary , the review of legislation on pesticides and plant health protection should strengthen the free circulation of products , with mutual recognition of product appro@@ vals in the same zone and more rational procedures for approving active ingredients at European level , all of which should help to modernise European agriculture and improve the protection of our consumers and citizens .
amendments requiring the Member States to take measures to prevent the contamination of traditional crops by GMO crops ( Com@@ promise Amendments Nos 44 and 45 ) ;
The Court of Justice does indeed have problems .
One must call a spade a spade .
In such conditions , what value can be attached to promises - in any case extremely vague ones - that it will not happen again ?
On the subject of the budget , I feel firstly that it is vital that all players in the agricultural economy and rural development , the main guarantors of environmental protection , reduce useless administrative burdens so that they can focus on their main activity , which is continuing to achieve the quality agriculture we expect , and environment @-@ friendly agriculture at that .
You are building ca@@ st@@ les in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers .
I think that if the burden were spread over the Union as a whole it would not be too severe , and this is what we need to do to tackle the root of the problem .
In a situation in which bee colonies are becoming weaker and suffering excessive mortality , it is necessary to analyse all of the factors causing this increased bee mortality and to propose a plan of action to remedy this disastrous trend .
This is not the first time we have debated this matter .
When Parliament &apos; s resolutions refer to the clause , or call for appropriate measures to be taken , the Council should take heed of these calls and assess whether they are appropriate .
This is why I would again stress that for our policy on legal immigration and integration , as set by the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference , we need to apply the principles of qualified majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament .
Opening up to the world market , on the other hand , will expose it to the law of the jungle and to the plundering of the natural resources of Africa , wood , oil , minerals , the flora and even the fauna , by multinationals .
The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals .
These are unprecedented times , which require all of us - Commission , Council and Parliament - to rise to the occasion .
Some might say it is simply a coincidence that this crisis is taking place now that the Sta@@ be@@ x system has disappeared from the Cotonou agreement .
I voted in favour of this report because technical measures are very important in that they determine the activities of fishermen and have an impact on the future of fisheries resources .
This is why , from all points of view - passenger safety , energy saving and environmental quality - SESAR is an absolutely vital project .
Instead of planning a reduction in agricultural expenditure , which would be a blow to France and the southern countries , and which our group has opposed , why not look for new sources of financing , for example by taxing capital transactions ?
It tells us that implementing a tax at European level alone would be disastrous for our financial sector .
The Council wanted to increase this limit to 65 hours .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the signing of this agreement , as it is going to contribute to the political and economic stability , not just of this particular country , but of the Balkans as a whole .
As for outside the EU , you talked about this and I agree with your diagnosis .
The Council , in turn , was right to leave aside the misguided , poorly assemb@@ led projects tabled by the Commission and instead take practical , operational decisions .
After this united effort , the world &apos; s rich nations , together with the governments of these countries , must draw up a plan for rebuilding this area and go beyond cancelling debts .
This committee is becoming increasingly important due to its close ties with the citizens . As enlargement approaches , the committee &apos; s work should continue .
On the contrary , we know that they are just as effective as other medicines . Making such products available , however , could only be one aspect of cur@@ ing disease and fighting the epidemics we are trying to curb .
But I do pay tribute to the efforts of the European Commission and the European Union : it is true that , in relative terms , they have tried harder than other countries have .
The consequences of the decisions we take will weigh heavily , socially and economically .
Fern√°ndez Mart√≠n report ( A5 @-@ 02@@ 16 / 2000 )
The rapporteur &apos; s original idea - like that of Mrs Lindeperg , whose report results from the same logic , despite the fact that they belong to different political groups - is that in view of the present difficulties in these areas , the policies can no longer be dealt with at national level alone .
At the moment , when the world is being threatened by deflation and the situation is being aggravated by the tendency of some countries to hastily cut their VAT rate as part of a Key@@ nes@@ ian policy , it is obvious that setting this target of 2 % is no longer just for show .
Mr President , I am pleased to see Parliament , in the form of Mrs Fourtou &apos; s report , prepared to undertake an extensive campaign against counterfeiting and piracy within the internal market .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the harm caused by credit rating agencies is now plain to see .
The current bans are more than sufficient .
I shall vote against it and I also condemn it .
That is a particular , clear , concrete result of your action .
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign ext@@ ol@@ ling the benefits of a federal Europe .
We must now move on to actions .
The effectiveness of the measures which will be decreed depends on us being consistent , but we must bear in mind that however coercive they are , these measures cannot be totally imper@@ me@@ able .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - I think that , as far as transparency is concerned , these agreements should be highly transparent .
Pl@@ ur@@ alism is essential in the information society , but not in a form which consists of two speeds , one being direct control by the PSE and the PPE , and the other being a vague monthly report on the body &apos; s activities , intended for the other political groups .
First , on the single currency .
I see here some familiar faces , some less familiar , and a number of issues which are apparently still recurring .
The draft European Pact on Immigration and Asylum , which will be debated in October , is a step in the right direction , and I congratulate the EU ministers on their response this week to the draft prepared by Brice Hortefeux . You have our support , Mr Hortefeux .
The second topic is climate change .
Having said that , I think you are right , Madam President , to declare it admissible because the vote this amendment involves is not a vote for or against the explanatory statement , but is simply intended to highlight the distance between that explanatory statement and the resolution .
What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publ@@ ish@@ ers are persecuted , as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appe@@ al , in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd , arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean @-@ Olivier Vi@@ out , the smu@@ g expression of strait@@ j@@ ack@@ eted thinking and intellectual conform@@ ism ?
It is extremely difficult to rewrite treaties which have been negotiated , sometimes down to the last comm@@ a , and the next item in our debate provides an elo@@ quent example of this .
. This Charter is a good thing , and even a success , in that it has been implemented in 35 countries .
In fact , in France , in 1997 , 83 % of applications for asylum were rejected . These included applications from Algerian victims of terrorism and from Kurds who were the victims of oppression that was as severe as that now experienced by the people of Kosovo .
There obviously remain points on which Romania ought to continue to make progress .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , approximately 80 % of the antibiotics produced around the world intended for animals are administered in animal feed .
In both cases , use is made of so @-@ called open networks whose authenti@@ cation , integrity and confidentiality must be assured .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you tell us things and you make hypothetical statements such as : &apos; the fight against terrorism has to be conducted with respect for basic human rights &apos; .
Finally , by voting &apos; no &apos; did the Irish want to turn over a new leaf as far as European integration is concerned and were they expressing a negative opinion on the accession of a country like Croatia ?
We shall be voting in favour of the amendments seeking to supplement the report by giving it a more political , more positive sl@@ ant , and we shall naturally with@@ hold our vote if the main amendments are rejected .
In other words , when reason fails , we must invoke legal , or even criminal , liability .
Admittedly , these budgets would probably prove to be very high .
In 2004 , the Turkish Cypriot community clearly expressed its desire to have a future within the EU .
She has studied the proposals with great care , and she has taken the trouble to consult with the many parties concerned . That approach has been an asset in defining and optimising the implementation of this programme .
The enlarged , reunified Europe , the land of freedom , the land of human rights , has the duty to comply with its future Constitution .
We should look at these broad issues of implementation together and explore constructive ways of dealing with them .
Evidently , SIS II will be a key tool in the Common Space of Freedom , Security and Justice and , to that end , it is clearly essential that this system should be operational as soon as possible .
Because the United States said so , or to deliver that country from obscurantism and violence ?
European electronic toll services are not a priority in this field .
Fortunately this report will not change the face of things .
But what will happen in a much enlarged Europe , where disparities are even greater than they are at present in social terms and budgetary matters ?
No less serious are the accusations made by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch against countries within the European Union the Netherlands , the United Kingdom , Germany , Austria and Sweden who do not hesitate to return alleged terrorists to countries such as Syria , Egypt or Uzbekistan , where the risk that they will be tortured or m@@ ist@@ re@@ ated is very high .
We are told that &apos; it is complicated &apos; .
The Commission wants to emphasise that the issues covered by the Code are not directly within its remit , but it is following these developments very closely and will continue to keep a close eye on them .
The form and scope of the next framework programme will , however , also depend upon the available funds which , as the honourable Member will appreciate , will depend in the first place upon the results of the discussions under way concerning the financial perspectives .
We must engage in dialogue to tackle the fundamental reasons why people risk their lives to cross the oceans in search of a better life in Europe .
The Council has so far resor@@ ted too sel@@ dom to common actions and positions and has demonstrated obvious sl@@ oth .
We cannot expect the IGC to remove all these obstacles and it would therefore be wise at least to see this Treaty as a precur@@ sor to the institutional reforms of the year 2000 .
Which country will experience the greatest demographic problems by the year 2020 , without even daring to talk about 2050 ?
Some of us still recall the time when hydro@@ electric dam@@ s burst .
Consequently , this German law whose defence is being claimed in this case is based in the tradition of the Third Re@@ ich .
Our colleagues here see rac@@ ists and fasc@@ ists everywhere .
But the solution is not supranational integration of immigration policy based on false priorities .
It related to the attitude which you adopted 10 years ago following the Asian crisis : an attitude which you today consider was insufficiently firm towards those who thought that these were passing problems .
We must wholly condemn and punish these practices .
It is doubtful , however , whether this will result in better application of this scrutiny in the future , if only because of the Commission &apos; s secret desire to prevent Parliament from holding consultations on the measures it plans to implement .
Despite this changing context , President Barroso cl@@ ings to the existing integrated guidelines as though they were engra@@ ved in Portuguese mar@@ ble .
Pro@@ duction must be improved , and the budget of the CAP must be used to reorganise this policy .
or the democratic route , by creating a body at the heart of the European Union , as in Great Britain and the United States , which is the equivalent of the British &quot; National Ac@@ counting Office &quot; ( NA@@ O ) or the American &quot; General Ac@@ counting Office &quot; ( G@@ AO ) .
Its response was comprehensive , and that is the added value which European action brings : the Union has asserted itself as an effective and credible , in fact , vital partner , on which the United States and third countries can rely in the fight against terrorism .
In that context , let me take advantage of Mr Michel &apos; s presence and congratulate him on his diplomatic activity over the past weeks , which , I believe , is bound to produce positive results in terms of establishing a very broad coalition against terrorism and its supporters .
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995 @-@ 1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .
Mr Commissioner , I have clearly understood the relative optimism that you demonstrate with regard to the consequences of the Asian crisis on the European economy .
Most of the European Parliament &apos; s amendments to the text of the common position are real improvements and can therefore be accepted by the Commission .
Mr Guardans , Mr Medina and Mr M@@ av@@ rom@@ mati@@ s have made that point very well indeed , and I agree with them .
The system is up and running , however , and Parliament has endorsed it several times .
And developments in recent months have meant that many European countries are further away from reaching this goal .
This raises a question of principles - what sort of Europe do we want ?
Resolution 4@@ 78 affirms that all measures taken to modify the status of the city are null and void .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to comment on the extent to which we in this House are still , even today , not entirely in agreement , which is quite a positive point .
That is why regional conflict @-@ management mechanisms have been set up and must continue to be examined and developed , with the help of the European Union . They must gradually take on responsibility for measures in the field , as part of a common strategy , coordinated between the Member States and the ACP countries themselves , and it is up to our Parliament to continue to define these measures and to play a more active part in monitoring their implementation .
&quot; Of course , &quot; I said . &quot; Be patient .
The news stories we see every day have become an inescapable fact of society .
Whilst the han@@ ged men of Ch@@ ic@@ ago died in 18@@ 86 for an eight @-@ hour working day and a 40 @-@ hour working week , here we have , at the beginning of the 21st century , the great social innovation of the European Union , which should seek to raise the ceiling on the maximum weekly working time from 48 hours to 65 hours , or indeed above that in the event of individual or collective agreements , with the reference period for calculating the maximum weekly working time increased from four to 12 months .
It congratulates you as an individual , in the light of your cour@@ te@@ ousness and other human qualities and also in the hope of your impartial management of this Parliament that we are forming .
Instead , the proposed resolution seems to primarily deplore , without daring to say so clearly , the fact that a European country took an initiative without continually remaining in the ranks of those who issued friendly calls .
Propos@@ als on tariffs , which were furthermore of a high quality , were exchanged .
I take advantage of this occasion to congratulate her on her commitment to European television and to thank her for the attention she has clearly given to professionals from the sector .
In short , Commissioner , you have been rather hasty .
This text does now afford us a more comprehensive overview of the Commission &apos; s implementation of the 1998 budget , but at the price of a political conflict dominated by a feeling of frustration .
And I would like to say unambiguously that , if any State does not want to join Europol , then the others should do so and go ahead without it .
We should also , for example , give small , less powerful boats access to reserved areas to be used as their main resource .
All I would say is that our role is to listen to the growing worries - and the word is weak - in a number of States in relation to the reforms undertaken in the name of the Bologna process .
The use of the words &apos; migration flows &apos; sets the tone : it gives the impression that migrants are commodities or inv@@ ad@@ ers .
It is therefore not only a question of attacking Mr McCreevy &quot; s zeal , but also of opposing the harmful provisions themselves of the .
Similarly , I can only oppose a carbon tax at every level , as it would invari@@ ably penalise the least well @-@ off citizens , as seen with Mr Sarkozy &apos; s unjust and unpopular project .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on rising food prices , because no one can be content with the situation that has prevailed for months and which is primarily affecting small @-@ scale farmers and consumers .
Take , for example , the impact assessment that the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Gender Equality commissioned for the purposes of the directive on maternity leave .
The Union &apos; s necessary competitiveness should be improved , that goes without saying , but wage cuts and social expenditure cuts should not be the only ad@@ ju@@ stable variable .
In this regard , I believe that it is very important that we continue the work that Parliament has already embarked on .
In these conditions , emotions come into play , and that is why we wanted to ask this question .
We hope the European agricultural sector will be reassured that we shall continue to fight for support to allow them to continue to provide the services it rend@@ ers to society . We shall also strive to protect our quality products by defending our designations of origin .
That is the one point on which there is general consensus , and on this I agree with Mr Watson . That much is clear .
I welcome the existing initiatives and , in particular , the European Forest F@@ ire Information System - the pilot project .
This Community governed by the rule of law is the foundation of a market that has become increasingly important as the years have gone by .
Europe has a duty to be a model .
For its part , the European Parliament has been consulted .
At a time when differences in national laws restrict cross @-@ border trade substantially , especially for SMEs , introducing a framework for European contract law is a real step forward that we should support .
I therefore believe that our approach to immigration , especially with our Mediterranean neighbours , must form part of a much more global approach .
Giving the pharmaceutical companies the option of communicating information on their products will not make it possible to eradicate erroneous information , but will authorise advertising on prescription @-@ only medicines .
The real problem does not arise from the ionisation process itself as much as from the use to which it is put .
It is unacceptable that European Union funds devoted or allocated to human rights organisations in some countries should be blocked by their governments ; I believe the President of Parliament brought this home forcefully when visiting one of those countries .
Furthermore , the digital media sector could achieve 20 % annual growth over the next decade .
Finally , I would like to thank Professor Tsatsos for having mentioned the connection between these proposals and the role of the European Parliament .
The situation being as it is , I would have preferred the common position to be rejected in the same way that I prefer good hand@@ made chocolate to an industrial product which is currently un@@ verifiable .
This is quite simply because the capital flows that concern us start out in the European Union , then may move elsewhere , only to return to the European Union .
However , if , after ten years , this directive needs a &apos; fac@@ eli@@ ft &apos; in order to adapt to the evolution of the markets , to the increasingly sophisticated financial products available , I remain concerned about the fate of the older funds , which do not meet the new demands .
A number of amendments even ratify the employers &apos; point of view on the flexibility offered by this form of insecure employment . Clearly , temporary employment makes it possible to dismiss workers overnight , without even being obliged to implement a social plan or pay compensation .
Before now the European records system did not function effectively .
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy &apos; s report , the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention , the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and , finally , the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes , on the basis of a real partnership .
Whilst regretting this situation , Parliament &apos; s delegation accepted the amount specified in the common position , subject to a joint declaration by the three institutions relating to the Commission proposal for the adoption of a new framework programme in the field of public health after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
This responsibility is a historical one , primarily , and is related to the commitments made by Member States to the countries where the bulk of the tropical forest is located .
Thank you to all of you .
No one today knows the intentions of the future leaders of the Israelis and the Palestinians .
I shall present these proposals to you at the second plenary session of January .
We need to show increased solidarity with these countries and with their population .
En@@ shr@@ ined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948 , freedom of expression and information is recognised as a fundamental right .
There have already been more than a thousand deaths , and the number of people affected is increasing all the time , even though specialists say that the measures to prevent the disease from proving fatal are relatively simple to take .
. The rapporteur proposes the rigorous separation of traditional and GMO crops .
The second difficulty , after environment , is agriculture , which is still a very sensitive subject .
I believe that the presence by your side of a strong Commission making its contribution to the development of that mandate is equally essential .
The airlines will undoubtedly do well out of it , but the air traffic control staff and passenger safety will not .
These two texts , therefore , allow us to show the face of an open European Union , welcoming the citizens of third countries , who may thus legally take up residence and work at whatever level at which they are qualified , and , needless to say , in full enj@@ oyment of their rights .
With regard to the Member States , not only do they fail to intervene to put a stop to these increases , they also profit from them through fuel taxes , which is yet another indirect tax , as unfair as VAT , because it hits the richest and the poorest in the same way .
The Ra@@ fa@@ h Wall , with its symbolic significance , is part of this blind urge man has to be free .
There is no use crying over the ruins or critici@@ zing the brutality of certain announcements of plant closures , involving mass redundancies .
What is more , we have this great and wonderful plan to enlarge towards the East , even though we fear that our Polish or Hungarian friends might not be on the same level as us .
States do need to manage their budgets according to good house@@ keeping rules , not by revitalisation through public expenditure , which is a short @-@ term sweeten@@ er but never a lasting solution .
Community solidarity should be expressed at this level .
We are going to follow this review very closely with our international partners , and also within the context of our support for the institutional reform of the judicial sector .
I am quite aware that this was not exactly the question you were asked , but nevertheless it seems to me to be important , if we are making progress on the social rights of homosexuals in the European institutions , for us to ensure that the current policies of all of the European institutions are consistent with this .
This process should be pursued by future presidencies .
By means of this vote , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats broke an earlier compromise with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that protected health services by keeping them outside the scope of the &apos; Services &apos; Directive .
Over@@ hau@@ l taxation , and you will reduce working time .
Mr President , honourable Members , Mr Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , I would like to thank the European Parliament for raising this question today because it allows me to draw attention once again , Minister , to the fact that trans @-@ European transport networks are the key to the Lisbon strategy and to growth in Europe .
This ide@@ alism is all very well from an intellectual point of view but it will not save the planet , which in any case is not in real danger as such .
They want us to believe that the transport of radioactive materials is not a matter for the nuclear industry and that we , the Group of the Greens , are in the wrong debate . I should like to see an end to this hypocrisy !
The two other reports are also mar@@ red by such ideological attitudes .
We cannot let the market impose laws and criteria that make production the be @-@ all and end @-@ all .
Should they at last put an end to the state of emergency in which their country has been for over 30 years ?
Too many elderly people , and more often than not women , have lag@@ ged behind in finding decent employment and decent salaries throughout their professional life .
Nor is it apparent that the calculation of State aids and compensation , whether legitimate or not , should be made the subject of a debate .
The difficulties in tackling this subject stem from the fact that we are treating both universities and technical establishments of higher education in the same way .
I am glad that , for once , the European institutions are taking up an idea which comes from the smallest country in the European Community .
And what will be the result of all this ?
The prospect of uniting nations around a common political project , on a democratic basis and in order to promote the prosperity and welfare of the various peoples is an ex@@ hilar@@ ating one .
Mr President , under the good influence of certain Member States , the Council &apos; s draft budget forms part of a rigorous approach to public finances that should be highlighted .
To create a European financial market could be a move in the wrong direction because of the finances of unstable and discriminatory markets or an obsession with financial assets .
Any form of coalition can constitute an interim measure with a view to fresh elections that are free , democratic and transparent , as stated by the candidate opposing Mr Mugabe .
- Mr President , I should like , as one Member has already done , to draw your attention to a letter that has been sent to the various Inf@@ o @-@ Po@@ ints Europe , informing them that they are to lose their funding from the Commission .
This specifically applies to the issue of governance , to what we are going to do in terms of shareholder liability - we are working from a long @-@ term perspective - and to what we want to do , as I was saying earlier to Mrs Ferreira , with regard to bank resolution .
We , the Commission , are convinced that , in the case of water , we have good reason to address requests to third countries with regard to water supply .
I did not deny the existence of the gas chambers , nor did I play down their significance .
With regard to the joint financing of aid programmes proposed by Member States under Article 30 of Regulation EC / 12@@ 57 / 99 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guid@@ ance and Guarantee Fund ( EAGGF ) , I would further stress that the Commission is prepared to be extremely flexible .
It is a very wide @-@ ranging response and we shall present other proposals , some of which , indeed , we have already presented .
Overall , the Commission &apos; s proposals can be considered as a step in the right direction and they are a satisfactory response to local needs .
None has so far emerged from the discussions taking place in Geneva , because of the American position .
- Rail transport today stands at the heart of the public service deregulation and liberalisation projects being implemented by the European Union .
Lastly , we have proposed to double the amount of funding , but not at the expense of agriculture or of the Structural Funds .
First lesson : our agriculture , with all frontiers open , is in danger of sli@@ ding down the slip@@ per@@ y sl@@ ope of levelling down , whereas , in accordance with the spirit of Article 100@@ a , we should set a high standard of quality for ourselves .
It has nothing to do with me , if the rules of the game have been explained time and time again and you still do not know what they are even today !
This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and , once it is implemented , will replace the financial protocols which have now expired .
This is all the more so because the European Parliament wanted to extend the profits of this fund to &apos; small labour markets &apos; where redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local economy .
That is our position .
Indeed , this text reconciles economic , social , political and institutional dimensions in order to ensure that trade between the two geographical areas also benefits the most disadvantaged populations and contributes to the sustainable development of the sub@@ continent .
I do not know what the exact English translation is , but I believe the English concept of &apos; public interest &apos; is much wider and much more vague than the French expression &apos; ordre public &apos; .
The aim of this directive was , firstly , to define a common evaluation procedure of active substances for both existing and new pesticides , and , secondly , to establish a positive list of authorised substances , which are deemed to be acceptable for health and the environment .
This is a movement that aspires to a different kind of globalisation , which is beginning to create a globalisation of solidarity and which is calling for a globalisation of rights .
If we fail to admit that we , who sit in the same Parliament , have the right , the duty to see what is happening in one of the Member States , how can we tell dictatorships in distant countries that we defend a universal idea , which is so very important for the defence of women &apos; s rights , in particular ?
These products would not have been subject to the full tests that provide the same guarantees as those carried out on animals .
I shall therefore be voting against this motion for a resolution , which I regard as a motion that ignores human beings and proposes measures with traumatic and brutal consequences for the fisheries chain .
In this respect , I would like to point out that we are also going to meet in Paris on 5 October with all the European athletes who took part in the Olympic Games .
From now on , high @-@ level representatives will be able to convey the Union &apos; s message in the highest international body .
By way of example , the joint manual and joint consular instructions have become regulations , and new proposals under the third pillar complement or replace the equivalent provisions of the Schengen Convention , which have been assigned to this pillar .
The crux of this regulation lies not in Article 5 , but in Article 3 , which sets out the basic principle that the parties are independent , and Article 4 , which contains the rules on the law applicable in cases where the parties have not chosen which should apply .
I would like in particular to draw your attention to Amendment No 2@@ 74 on the production of natural sweet wines .
Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate Mr Wijkman and thank him for being so open to dialogue and willing to listen to the amendments put forward in the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
In a number of cases the Member States have had highly encouraging experience of this , through a gradual process of decentr@@ alization of employment .
The reports that we are looking at today are about expanding the Centre to Norway and to the 13 candidate countries .
Re@@ turning to the disastrous Blair House agreements , which have allowed America to dominate the oilseed sector completely , this should be a fundamental concern of a Commission that truly wants to defend European interests .
There is also the problem of social welfare cover according to local law .
We therefore categorically reject Mrs Jackson &apos; s proposal to link payments from the Structural Funds to the transposing by Member States of EU environmental legislation .
We have always wanted and always wished for a strong Commission .
This crude materi@@ alism , sometimes attributed to Marx@@ ists , has now been adopted by cynical capitalists whose only aim is to extend the rule of trade regardless of social needs .
The wait @-@ and @-@ see policy , the stand@@ sti@@ l@@ ls and the prevaric@@ ations are therefore truly disastrous for the future of the Mediterranean .
I do not think there is any justification for adopting the dis@@ gr@@ un@@ tled attitude you have shown towards the secular ideal in recital G of your report . Today &apos; s Europe is rooted in that ideal , which stands out with great clarity , to my mind , in the Charter of Fundamental Rights we have accepted .
They have therefore gone further than the Thessaloniki declaration of 2003 , which talked about the great challenge represented by the integration of the five countries of the Balkans and their eventual accession to the Union .
I knew , Mr President , that I would find an ally in the European Parliament .
Mr President , the increase in the number of asylum seekers over the last few years is causing grave problems for Member States , which are having serious difficulty in coping with the situation .
While agreeing with many of the statements made in the report , the Members of Lutte ouvri√®re will abstain in protest at the immense hypocrisy which characterises the activities of the European Parliament when it claims to be combating poverty .
As such , of course , this question is not strictly speaking within the Commission &apos; s competence .
At its extraordinary summit in Johannesburg , on 10 November , the SADC also stated its readiness , if need be , to send a peace @-@ keeping force to the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Mr President , the report &apos; s estimated 28 % pay differential between men and women is particularly revolting because in many cases even men are not paid nearly enough to make a decent living in the twenty @-@ first century .
Secondly , the geographical distribution criteria will be respected in order to achieve as balanced a representation as possible .
We will again try and demonstrate the financial waste that it represents as soon as it is back on the table of the EP Committee on Budgets .
We have a text that has potential for the development of the industry - and therefore for keeping and creating jobs - and for users .
I say to you that the Union can no longer stand id@@ ly by .
In addition to this , since 2007 the EU has maintained a dialogue on human rights within the framework of the Cooperation Agreement with Pakistan , which makes provision for a regular dialogue on governance and human rights .
We allowed an open debate in the Security Council where the concerns as to the legality of this proposition could be expressed .
The Commission has committed itself to guaranteeing reciprocity in the implementation of the agreement on visas , equal treatment regarding registration procedures and free movement within Russia .
The Commission proposes to put an end to the use of these substances in eight specific fields , and the Committee on the Environment , on that basis , proposes that the area of application be extended to include co @-@ formul@@ ants in pesticides as well as active substances and co @-@ formul@@ ants in bi@@ oci@@ des .
The figures speak for themselves .
I want a Europe that allows for the emergence of new economic models .
The likelihood of break@@ downs and ou@@ tages grows with the geographical complexity of the network .
I would also like to say that , in the austerity measures , which the Commissioner has just spoken about , it was obviously important to consider the measures to be taken in order to ensure that austerity does not make people even poorer .
I am referring here to the open method of coordination , a wonderful expression , meaning that it is the Member States , not the Union , that decides , and that all that one does is compare results from the various Member States .
I believe we must adopt a partnership approach and try to find solutions for ordered , controlled but legal immigration , which , once people arrive in Europe , will allow them to be integrated and participate fully in life in our society .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , Mr President of the Commission , it is already three months since work on the IGC opened officially in Turin and we are forced to recognize that we find ourselves in a blocked situation .
Finally , the rapporteur &apos; s proposal that total aid should be increased to ECU 500 per hectare seems a good compromise between the Commission &apos; s proposal and the demands made by certain Member States who would like to see the premiums virtually doubled .
Furthermore , the text submitted to us at second reading is not acceptable and the subsequent proposals of Commissioner Bolkestein and the amendments voted for by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs do not sufficiently improve the balance of the text .
Instead , we incorporated our programme , the Belgian programme with its five priorities , into the European agenda , into the programme of the Commission , into the momentum generated by the Heads of State or Government at the level of the European Council , into the programme of the troika with our Spanish and Hungarian colleagues .
Why not paralyse the Association Agreement as we courageously did before in South Africa against the apartheid ?
I am simply trying to explain to you the limits of what we can usefully do , because the problem is , in fact , one of doing things that are of use .
I must warmly congratulate Mrs Izquierdo Rojo on her excellent own @-@ initiative report , compiled as a result of the hearing on women and fundamentalism held on 23 January 2001 .
in writing . - I voted for the own @-@ initiative report by my German colleague , Klaus @-@ Heiner Lehne , on a simplified business environment for companies in the areas of company law , accounting and auditing , in response to the European Commission &apos; s communication on the subject .
This passage reminds me of another extract from five years ago , which stated that the mandate of the Commission at that time had been characterised by progress in several fields in order to prepare for the future with the necessary confidence and resources .
But is it not time , whilst totally respecting the choice of couples and families - let me repeat that I am in no way in favour of any kind of pressure - to realize that a family policy would be infinitely more economic from all points of view and that we would avoid a great deal of social expenditure further down the line ?
Experience shows that what were once effective aids to military action can turn into serious obstacles to a political solution .
So it is easy to see that , without control , the ECB will be all @-@ powerful .
The third theme relates to the measures specifically aimed at preventing terrorist activities .
They are implementing reforms that have often gone against the major ti@@ des of public opinion .
I shall , however , focus my attention on the problem of fraud and irregularities .
We must also examine the effectiveness of aid and the use of public funds and promote equality between men and women .
The Council has added an annex with a virtual shopping list of individual exemptions and derogations so that each of the 15 Member States can find what they want in the list and can therefore agree to the text .
A detailed summary of the report is available in three languages at the entr@@ ance to the Chamber . The first part of the report which I am presenting gives , for the first time , a snapshot of the European Union in terms of cohesion for the 27 countries of the Union post @-@ enlargement .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would just like to emphasise , in this matter , how capable the Community institutions are of reacting in order to effectively resolve the problems of our fellow citizens .
Freedom of expression and , hence , freedom of the press , are some of the most important fundamental rights .
The hearing was conducive to constructive and dis@@ passionate debate .
Poverty means much more than simply being out of work , and those who experience extreme poverty on a daily basis are not just looking for a job ; they want proper access to existing rights .
Ladies and gentlemen , in relation to the date we are commemor@@ ating today a quote occurred to me from a great Portuguese author , A@@ gu@@ s@@ tina B@@ ess@@ a Luis .
Quite probably , our points of view and our positions will not always be the same . There will probably be differences of opinion , that would be only normal .
Nor can we remain silent over the distressing problem of the refugee camps in B@@ hu@@ tan , to which I am particularly sensitive , having visited them last year as a member of the delegation , and hope that the positive actions which were embarked upon to solve this problem are pursued with the same vigour .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would also like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Gr√§@@ ss@@ le , for her important work within the framework of these reports , which enhance the plans for a financial regulation for executive agencies .
Besides , we know the death penalty is not a deterrent , it is quite unacceptable for countries claiming to be civilised ( like the United States ) to continue applying it in a wholesale and systematic manner , running an immense risk of making irreparable legal mistakes .
These texts may also suffer somewhat from the fact that they come to us mainly from Italy , the first country really to have a firm grasp of this whole issue .
But certain problems continue to be in@@ trac@@ table , even if things are moving in the right direction .
Despite the investment of considerable sums of money , the citizen as consumer risks being the victim of permanent confusion .
I encourage the services of the European Commission together with the Member States to recognise the work done by women that is not yet officially recognised , and to do so irrespective of the social status of these women .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Council , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , it is fortunate that the desire of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats for Europe in 2008 to be effective and able to respond to the concerns of its citizens coincides with the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union .
I have no great enthusiasm for the way they are being treated , I must say , by Algeria and in the camps with which I am familiar .
As we are all aware , a recession is defined as negative growth for two con@@ secu@@ tive six @-@ month periods . According to Mr von Wogau , we must now wait six months to see if we are really in a recession .
Firstly , enlargement of the Union may not be the highest priority of the next six months , but it is probably in this field that your geographic situation , your history and your political experience can help us to overcome many obstacles .
We are now being asked to allow a short delay , in order to improve it further .
However , Point 7 of Mr Imbeni &apos; s report , in which he proposes to report on the public bodies of third countries , which hinder human rights projects , seems rather dispu@@ table to me .
In our thinking there is no contradiction between cohesion on one side and competitiveness on the other , on the contrary .
It must not be possible to condemn a state for applying the precautionary principle , for protecting its environment , or for rejecting imports proved to be produced by child labour .
I am asking Members to vote in favour of Amendment 36 to encourage student mobility .
I hope that Europe will take this problem seriously and deal forcefully with speculators .
Nor must you count on my we@@ ariness to stop me ham@@ mer@@ ing out evidence which , although on the face of it appears dogmatic , should be blatantly obvious to everyone : The WTO is a machine that should by swit@@ ched off before it goes any further , instead of carrying on as if there were no problem apart from the stun@@ ning failure that was Seattle .
It is no longer a report , it is a catalogue .
The Commission cannot , however , accept , as they stand , Amendments 5 , 7 and 37 which propose giving each Member State the competence to legislate on the appropriateness , or otherwise , of employers assessing the risks in the case of exposure to natural sources of radiation .
As can be seen in its explanatory statement , this report appears , in substance , to be trying to keep everyone happy : the Commission , which is implementing the deregulation ; the Member States which are - for the time being - responsible for ensuring safety ; the major airlines , upon whom there is no question of imposing overly restrictive - and , above all , excessively costly - regulations ; the low cost airlines , upon whom the report is seeking to impose certain minimum standards , as long as these do not affect their profits ?
Everyone here has condemned the Commission &apos; s declaration as lacking in ambition .
However , it is not enough on its own .
On the nature of reforms , we consider that reform of the Commission and of the weighting of votes is good , but that it is the whole of the balance , political , institutional and administrative , that must be revised within the perspective of a substantial enlargement .
I should like cordi@@ ally to respond to Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , who was asking us just now whether anyone was concerned about these issues a year ago .
In the resolution of 11 March 1994 , and later in the resolutions regarding Cairo and International Fam@@ ily Year we in this Parliament voted for genuine liberty , freedom of choice , for women in matters of family planning .
It is not a matter therefore of interfering in this process .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , what does the future of the Union depend on ?
This debate was of great interest to the Commission but it was also somewhat limited since neither the Commission nor yourselves had yet defined precise positions and proposals .
Where is the Security Council &apos; s resolution ?
We therefore have the means to act in order to guarantee that there really will be a second stage towards our ultimate aim .
But a third solution has emerged from the negotiations which might allow everyone &apos; s concerns to be taken into account .
I understand why Mr Bullmann says that growth is actually taking place but that we must not rest on our lau@@ rels .
