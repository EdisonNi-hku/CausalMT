Mr President , I should like to thank you for visiting the Scottish Parliament last week .
Through petitions European citizens can raise their voice , can hold their government accountable .
I may wish to vote on some occasions but on this occasion I merely wish my presence to be noted .
Protec@@ ting consumers &amp; apos ; interests and ensuring food security must remain here our first priorities .
This report therefore makes a valuable contribution in this regard .
We need to give them certainty and encourage development and investment .
The recently adopted data protection directive , the report from the European Parliament on the proposed information security policy , the eEurope 2005 Action Plan and the plans to establish a European cyber security unit will further lay down the modalities for future work in the area of network and information security .
I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and , in particular , the two rapporteurs Mr Lehne and Mr Klinz for their excellent work on this file .
This has been raised several times .
Mr President , I wish to echo the disappointment expressed by P@@ au@@ line Green when she responded on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists at the beginning of this debate .
I believe that a deep reason for these doubts is that the European Union does not appear to give sufficient priority to offering practical solutions which make a difference to some of the issues of greatest concern .
Please do not believe that all our problems are over .
Our Prime Minister made very clear , on behalf of the Presidency , not just the significant achievement relating to Turkish accession - about which I will say more in a moment - but also the importance of sequ@@ encing the debate about the future of Europe with the issue related to future financing of Europe .
These would not be for Member States to have more debt or to cover excessive debt - because we have a problem with excessive debt in Europe - but specifically to fund some important infrastructure projects , mainly with the support of the European Investment Bank - as you correctly said .
Both of them should apply pragmatism to ensure that a strong , effective , coherent diplomacy can be created across the breadth of policy .
Those are the central elements in the report .
As we are all aware , the initial decision to hold an inquiry was not without its difficulties .
I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has announced that the European Union is going to meet with the US authorities to discuss unfair competition , but that is a grossly inadequate response to the current crisis in the aviation industry .
I would therefore like to remind you of the objectives that were envisaged when we put forward this recast of the hygiene rules .
But , as I said , there should be this balance and people should be aware of where this balance should be struck .
I myself have often witnessed positive developments , for instance in 2000 , when I was chairperson of the OECD .
I welcome the fact that the Convention recognises the distinctive nature of cultural goods and services as trans@@ mit@@ ters of values and identity and it establishes that they transcend their commercial dimension legiti@@ mis@@ ing thus domestic and international cultural policies .
We need to overcome the differences that exist between regulators and make sure that we speak with one voice .
It is a priority for us all that the Constitution should enter into force .
Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ological sites and traditional homes have been destroyed to enable these high@@ ways to be built .
I look forward to working with you on your reports in the future and showing you similar understanding and support .
I would remind the honourable Member that Article 2 of the European Union @-@ Israel Israel Association Agreement states that : &amp; apos ; Relations between the Parties , as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself , shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles , which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement . &amp; apos ;
We all know this is essential for our vision of competitive , secure and sustainable energy for Europe .
If Europe is not ambitious here , I am very much afraid that we will lose the growing markets of this century to our competitors .
One example is conflict prevention , which may involve issues that are not part of the normal diplomatic agenda .
We do not accept the remainder of Amendment No 20 .
I would like to take this opportunity to support the common position and Mr K@@ il@@ li@@ lea &amp; apos ; s reports and commend them to the House .
Last year the Court of Justice decided that the citizens of the European Union have a right of access to healthcare in all Member States .
Nevertheless competition policy can and does make an essential contribution to the maintenance and development of media pluralism both in traditional television and other broadcasting markets and the new media .
The situation is completely unclear for the local people .
These are significant parts in the Union .
Indeed it is going to have to recruit the best people in a very competitive market .
There have been signals from several Member States lately - including from France - that they may reconsider their negative position .
Mr President , I agree with everyone who has spoken tonight .
Mr President , this is a third and , I believe also slightly unnecessary , proposal that has come from the Kingdom of Spain .
This is not what should necessarily be happening in a European Parliament report .
The European Council will also approve the Baltic Sea Strategy .
Ac@@ cep@@ tance of this package in the vote tomorrow will enable a highly ambitious and innovative policy to come into force .
Only short @-@ term term measures of this kind can be justified .
Schengen brought with it an increase in the possibility of trafficking in illegal goods and people across borders .
Despite around half a century of commercial operation of nuclear reactors , the solution to the long @-@ term term management of nuclear waste remains un@@ solved .
The US Administration showed a great deal of understanding because they also realised that the introduction of such measures would be a unilateral step and so would be contrary to our bilateral and multilateral approach .
The Commission listened to the concerns of the Member States and in late August presented the measures which have just been adopted by the Council .
It is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this .
I very much support the emphasis of the Commission statement , though I generally believe that many people in the Basque country would consider that it does not go far enough to meet their concerns .
To be fair , there is much that is sensible in this report .
This is an example of how the European Union does need to take a considered look at the advances in equipment .
Our priorities in this enlarged Europe must be to have more and better jobs : not to talk , but to .
However , the Minutes state that , in response to both Questi@@ ons Nos 46 and 51 , Mrs Thors was allowed to ask two supplementary questions .
Further discussion in the working party did not lead to changes in this conclusion .
As the Chair of this Parliament &amp; apos ; s Working Group on Innovation , Access to Me@@ dici@@ ne and Poverty @-@ related related Dis@@ eases , I think it is vital to focus our efforts on research and innovation if we are to meet the Millennium Development Goals .
On the one hand , we are still developing our knowledge of the deep oceans and face so much uncertainty that the full application of the precautionary approach is warranted .
The Committee will consider the need for an increase of the retention requirement , taking into account international developments .
The encouraging response to the Green Paper , however , gives confidence that we can achieve it .
Therefore , we must closely monitor third @-@ country country actions against our exports and intervene to minimise the negative impact of such actions on our companies .
But we can only imagine the trau@@ ma that she has suffered with a death sentence hanging over her head throughout the past year .
However , many of Malta &amp; apos ; s administrative , legal and fiscal structures have already been aligned to European Union standards .
Would that humanity could only see the fu@@ ti@@ lity of such wars .
She wants this type of work to be recognised as an occupation in its own right and is calling for European rules to be established on the rights of these workers - at present the situation varies from country to country .
The report expresses Europe &amp; apos ; s wish to reduce the Union &amp; apos ; s innovation deficit and achieve the goal set at Lisbon and , hence , does a great deal to help improve the EU &amp; apos ; s overall competitiveness .
It also has to be made absolutely sure - and this is what we have to find out - that our aid will not go to the terrorists .
We are still awaiting this Commission proposal , in line with Directive 97 / 67 / EC , which means that the articles relating to liberalisation of the previous directive may no longer apply .
I note with satisfaction that Mr Medina Ortega &amp; apos ; s report largely supports the approach proposed by the Commission .
I think you agree , Madam President , that Parliament has not covered itself in gl@@ ory with its tied result today .
One could argue that much of this framework agreement only clarifies existing provisions under the present EU Treaties .
Can I also say that this House constantly ru@@ shes to introduce regulation .
We cannot afford to close our eyes to the reality .
I welcome PNR systems as one part of our approach to counter@@ terrorism but , to the same degree , believe that we must be flexible in our approach when negotiating with third countries .
As I said in my opening remarks , I stand ready to keep this Parliament informed of developments , and I am sure that also goes for the future presidencies , not least in relation to the future in @-@ depth depth review agreed by the Council last week .
Finally , reinforcing economic governance is absolutely essential in order to reinforce the credibility of the euro and I do indeed count on your support when you vote on the resolution on Europe 2020 and on reinforcing economic governance .
I am asking , therefore , whether the President of Parliament would be prepared to look at ways in which improvements could be made , for example , by consultations prior to voting or by adjusting the order in which votes are taken .
Let us not turn 3 October into a black Monday for Europe , and let us vote against accession .
That is the point in time when we must take a decision and not now , as one or two Members seem to think , in order to gain some short @-@ term term political capital .
Mr President , I want to draw to your attention the fact that the agriculture debates will be starting in a few minutes . The amendments to two of the reports are still not available in English .
I hope the Commission will be able to make further funds available during budgetary discussions next week .
We need a study on this issue before we move to any further legislation .
I am prepared to present them to you in person when the time comes - not just in plenary but , if necessary , in the relevant committee .
So the security of Europe is directly connected to the Middle East .
I also commit myself and my staff to trying to move forward , to doing more of the same and to doing more of what I am asked to do .
Finally , there is a group of seven amendments that we cannot accept because they take away the flexibility necessary for the implementation of the programme or because they duplicate provisions of the common position .
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question .
Will it endeavour to give the European Union a new élan in proposing the necessary policy measures ?
Well , I agree .
According to the comitology agreement , there are not sufficient grounds for the Council to reserve the implementing powers for itself rather than deleg@@ ating them to the Commission .
in writing . - Mr Dr@@ ag@@ hi should be congratulated on his appointment , and I believe he is a very able candidate .
Health and safety legislation should be brought forward only if medical and scientific evidence demonstrates the need for it , as is the case for an amendment to Directive 2000 / 54 / EC on biological agents , to protect health workers from need@@ les@@ tick injuries .
Real steps are being taken to invest more in innovation , to make life easier for new and growing businesses , to help citizens prepare for change .
Mr President , I am not one to be carried away by much of the hy@@ st@@ eria over energy and climate change , but pursuing renewable energy has to be emin@@ ently sensible .
It is for us to unite around the best deal possible .
Mr President , the recent breakdown of the ceasefire in Nepal and the ensu@@ ing violence have led to a huge loss of life and injury .
We advise that this be done through animal welfare measures regarding poultry .
Could you please advise me which DG will prepare this report in 2009 ?
I want to look at the challenges that are inherent in the Lisbon process for Parliament , the Commission and , indeed , all three institutions .
I am pleased to see that this is also reflected in the outcome of the discussions between the EU institutions .
Although we acknowledge the proposal for a Nuclear Weapons Convention , Britain is concerned that we do not risk at this time diver@@ ting attention from , or undermining , the NPT and so warmly welcome the European Parliament resolution to restate our backing as a Parliament to this Treaty .
Thirdly , given the considerable functional overlap , has the Commission considered merging them ?
I will not go into all the other details of the implementation , but the question of purpose and justification needs to be answered before anything else , because the claim that it has been so useful in the fight against terrorism has not been substanti@@ ated to date : we are still waiting for evidence , and I would very much like to have that .
While the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda is largely a matter for the Member States , I am nevertheless pleased that the strategic guidelines set out an ambitious programme for growth and jobs , which we hope will be realised throughout the European Union .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for his words about the report .
Madam President , I would like to take this opportunity of thanking my friend and colleague Mr McCartin for his lesson in history .
Mr President , firstly I would like to pay tribute to Mr Katiforis for his work for the Greek Presidency within the Convention .
We cannot justify to the European taxpayers that more than EUR 2 billion is outstanding and for which we cannot put into place a manageable follow@@ up system .
Mr President , no sooner had Sudan emerged from 21 years of bloo@@ dy civil war between the Islam@@ ist Government of Sudan and the Christian / Anim@@ ist south , finally ended by the comprehensive peace agreement signed in Nairobi this January , than another appalling humanitarian situation emerged in Darfur in February 2003 , whose importance internationally must be reinforced now that attention may be dri@@ f@@ ting away following the tsunami in South @-@ East East Asia .
They recognise that consideration should be given to the means of combating more effectively the broadcasting of such material in the context of the revision of the Tele@@ vision Without Fronti@@ ers Directive , notably the adaptation of this instrument to the most recent technological developments .
The EU and the applicant states have much to prepare before enlargement can take place .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for the way in which he has worked so cooperatively with the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs on this .
Cardiff saw the first assessment of the national action plans for employment drawn up by each government .
The position of the EU should stay firmly on the side of those who are striving for freedom and who relentlessly support free elections .
Finally , on the two issues which do not relate to competition but have a bearing on prices , tax and the euro , I will not go beyond the answer I gave on the issue of the UK , cars and the euro .
My constituent , Dr M@@ igu@@ el @-@ Á@@ n@@ g@@ el Á@@ n@@ g@@ el M@@ ei@@ z@@ oso , faces extradition to Spain , not for a crime he is accused of committing , but rather to face investigation for a crime that he , allegedly , might decide to commit in the future .
However , I want to pay a sincere tribute to those who work in the institutions and have made the registers and access to documents a reality .
Equally , the idea that Turkey must join the EU in order to be transformed is incomprehensible .
Above all , it should serve as well as possible the important environmental objectives it pur@@ ports to achieve .
The transfer of quotas among Member States should not be allowed .
On 11 February , the European Parliament again rejected the interim agreement and a week prior to that , Parliament &amp; apos ; s Civil Liberties Committee rejected the deal .
I am not ignoring the bilateral agenda .
It is , of course , the strength of our petition system that it allows individuals to bring such events to our attention when the European institutions or legal framework have not assisted as they would have wished or expected .
Recent events have shown that citizens are becoming increasingly frustrated with the inability of politicians to deal with the effects of globalisation and other aspects of corporate life .
My congratulations go to all of those concerned in the work to date .
I particularly commend the rapporteur for encouraging the authorities in Bi@@ H to pursue wanted war crimes perpetrators and bring them to justice .
Whatever happened to the comments made here this very morning that this is an amending House ?
Mr President , own @-@ initiative initiative reports are usually just hot air , but if adopted they are an expression of the political will of the European Parliament .
The Turkish Foreign Minister yesterday said that were the European Union to open negotiations with Cyprus , then Turkey could not support the attendance of R@@ au@@ f Den@@ k@@ ta@@ sh in the second round of meetings designed to solve the Cyprus problem .
Secondly , a minor change is also needed in paragraph 19 in the ver@@ b ten@@ ses .
One , in response to Mr Lagendijk , it is true that some of the money going into the quick @-@ start start projects supported by the European Union was money from the 1998 and 1999 budgets .
Madam President , this White Paper between ourselves is worth more than all the recent gran@@ d@@ standing speeches of national leaders , because it combin@@ es clarity of purpose with a substantial degree of self @-@ criticism criticism .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like to thank you for your comments and the valuable views you expressed during the debate .
We must also look at our banking system and take the necessary action in order to ensure that banks are in a position to finance the economy appropriately , particularly SMEs .
We have a duty to respond to their plight .
Al@@ most ten years ago Israel and the Palestinians laid the foundation for a peaceful settlement of the Arab / Israeli conflict by recognising each other &amp; apos ; s right to exist and by concluding the Oslo Accord which helped to establish a Palestinian governmental structure for the first time ever .
Motion for a resolution ( B5 @-@ 0037 0037 / 2001 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Security and Defence Policy , on relations between the European Union and the Democratic People &amp; apos ; s Republic of Korea
That is why we need the reform because , to be honest with you , if we do not have any fish stocks then fishermen in the Mediterranean and all other European waters will have no future .
However , at the end of the day , they are prepared to live with them because they know they are restoring confidence .
This must be understood , not just by the Council of Ministers and the European Council , but also by the Court of Justice .
I saw this in India on a delegation visit and it is very important that we invest more in water management and make sure that it does not become an impediment to the educational progress of young girls and women .
It has , among other things , proposed reduced VAT rates for green products and services aimed at improving the energy efficiency of buildings in particular .
There is a question mark over whether the occup@@ ants of those posts should be engaged to such an extent in such a political battle while holding those offices .
Our oral question is in fact an expression of regret that the Council is not entering into these negotiations .
No doubt about that , we are completely on your side .
We must also recognise that grave damage has been done to consumer confidence and that must be restored .
It is very important that we do this to underpin civil dialogue .
So I ask my colleagues , and particularly my good friend the rapporteur , to let this vitally important piece of legislation proceed this week , so that agreement with the Council can be reached .
All this is valid when we talk about this problem .
What action does the Commission have in mind to foster an environment that spu@@ rs private companies to invest in research , and particularly in applied research , and encourages banks to finance investment in research and innovation ?
He has managed to incorporate most of the legislation that went through the Committee on the Environment , which is important .
It is Mrs Stauner &amp; apos ; s own explanation but it is the motion for resolution that we the Parliament have to decide on .
The European courts do not think that is reasonable and that is contained in this compromise .
The EU should use all means to secure the democratic character of the elections .
They would fundamentally undermine the capital standards for our industry .
It is very clear what they are saying .
. - Mr President , I know that the Commission proposal is based on the best of good intentions and we support good intentions in the wake of the awful tsunami disaster .
Yet homo@@ gen@@ ising EU law on the issue would undermine British competence in this area and also open up further channels for EU businesses to exploit the British market as they may be able to circumvent EU law .
Its government sends promising students to the EU to train , but once the training is complete they either do not return or when they do they find that their highly technical training relates very poorly to work in set@@ tings with little equipment and few drugs .
Mr President , I am pleased to see that Parliament endorses the approach proposed by the Commission .
This report approaches those problems in fundamentally the wrong way .
We cannot abolish visas unless we have very strict criteria .
However , the provision of high @-@ quality quality water resources is of huge importance in all geographical zones of the EU and issues such as water loss through inefficiency and stresses matter to us all .
They are weapons of dialogue that we use every day of the week in turning post - Communist states into Member States of the European Union or wider Europe neighbours , away from totalitarianism and tyran@@ ny and towards democracy .
I would like to make a few comments because I am sure that some Members of this Parliament did not listen to my first speech , when I talked about the soft fruit sector .
in writing . - I voted for this report not because I believe it makes the major step forward we need in tackling air quality , but because it is at least some advance , despite the attempt of some in Parliament to weaken this protection .
I would like to make three remarks .
I would refer you also to the fact - I have said this in other fora - that Director @-@ General General Lam@@ ou@@ re@@ u@@ x has made statements on nuclear energy which vastly exceed the brief of the Commission .
In this context , in November last year we invited the European banking industry to develop a European Code of Conduct by mid @-@ 2008 2008 .
Mr President , I am delighted this resolution has been adopted by Parliament in recognition of the problem that exists with additionality .
I hope that the Commission will take that up .
Concerning the fisheries agreement , again , this is a very specific question . However , I seem to remember that this issue was mentioned several times in previous enlargement negotiations .
The Convention is working on the idea of a politically united Europe without internal borders .
I find that unacceptable .
Is it within the next month ?
Nonetheless , the Commission will support the agreement between Parliament and the Council , if it is endorsed by your vote .
These measures have to be taken immediately and the process of monitoring should thereafter be continuous .
Mr President , I wanted to point out an important matter of principle .
There should be a high level of expertise and unitary case @-@ law law right from the start .
The Commission intends to present a new framework for SME policy in the second half of this year .
I should like to ask the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office and Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner Waldner why this is so .
As regards the toughness of Commission enforcement procedures , steady incre@@ mental reforms have already speeded up case handling .
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy , but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system .
It is a political tool in the advancement of an integrated Europe . It should be seen for what it is .
Mrs Lynne highlighted a couple of points that need to be re @-@ emphasised emphasised , for instance , for a peace process to be successful , all parties have to be involved in it .
Ironically enough , however , the advent of peace means that the attention given to the area is likely to decline quite ste@@ ep@@ ly , despite the fact that many of the underlying problems have by no means been resolved .
The Council is deser@@ ving of our thanks and our congratulations for those three things .
By now at least 20 countries have put in place measures affecting exports of importance to the European Union . We have counted over 4@@ 50 restrictions affecting various raw materials .
I am perhaps a little more cautious about it than some Members are .
Can he answer the last part of my question which is under what circumstances , should the appeal go the other way in the United States , would the Commission withdraw and ensure that the panel is not revi@@ ved ?
It is still possible for Member States to have additional requirements , but these should be covered by the single fee proposed for the new electronic platform .
It is because some Member States have tried to mud@@ dle through instead of reforming their ways .
We have proposed a wide range of financial market regulation measures .
I therefore thank him and the House for supporting this useful and progressive proposal as an investment in stable democracy in yet another part of our continent .
Concerning the revision of the market policy , I agree with the draft report that the new market policy of the CFP should revisit the instruments of the current common market organisation .
For that reason , I wish to say how delighted I am to be here today , to thank you for your cooperation and to wish the new Parliament well , in particular the newly elected Members .
We believe the IGC should concentrate on the essential institutional reforms .
in writing . - It is known that the report stresses the fact that forests should be seen as a major contributor to climate change mitigation and adaptation , rendering necessary the reinforcement of the EU strategy for combating the factors causing their deterioration , e.g. p@@ ests , forest fires , etc . Moreover , the report focused on establishing a general context concerning forest protection , namely subsidiarity , diversity of threats according to different forest types , the central role of Sustainable Fo@@ rest Management and the importance of forests for competitiveness and employment .
It is imperative that we think seriously about how to foster and strengthen the transatlantic relationship today .
I was in Nice as a civil servant when he defended a stronger Europe , easier decision @-@ making making and qualified majority voting .
In line with the principle of shared management , the Member States are responsible for selecting operations for financing under the structural funds .
Instead , we should focus on terrorist groups and other criminal elements that are either sitting on stock@@ pil@@ es of weapons or continuing to obtain them from various sources .
on behalf of the S &amp; amp ; D Group . - Mr President , let me commend my colleagues , Mr Lu@@ han and Ms M@@ ă@@ n@@ escu , for their excellent work .
We need to take this area of law outside the remit of a few specialists who may be able to charge a lot for it .
In conclusion , I would like to emphasise again the importance of good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in the forthcoming codecision procedure for the adoption of the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law .
Lastly , with regard to a series of amendments seeking clarification , greater transparency , etc . , on questions such as the application of the Aarhus Convention , cross @-@ border border projects , specific reference to the impact of climate change on biodiversity , the role of the Commission in supporting integration , etc . , my view is that these amendments could be acceptable to the Commission in principle , subject to some drafting changes .
We have upgraded transport systems and , as a result of all of this , our trade is working very well , but , if we stop it , obviously competition will be gone in the market at home , etc .
What exactly is it proposing to do ?
on behalf of the S &amp; amp ; D Group . - Mr President , today in the Chamber we are clearly hearing a very strong cross @-@ party party request for the Council to do everything possible to make refugee resettlement a reality .
The approval process for the Commission does not end here .
By maintaining price stability , it is our firm belief monetary policy makes the best contribution it can to achieving a high level of output and employment in the medium @-@ term term .
It must be hoped that agreement can be reached on that occasion .
But , as I said to the honourable Member , discussions have just started ; they are making good progress but they have not been finalised yet .
Mr President , you often come in for a lot of fla@@ k on these occasions and I think it is only right that on some occasions you should receive some compliments as well .
This is an important report .
It will present its conclusions before the end of this year .
I do want to reassure you that both the Presidency and the Commission have listened extremely carefully to your views and , as the Presidency said , we will take account of the debate here and communicate it to the Ministers on Friday .
Well , this just shows that when we can galvan@@ ise sufficient political will - and I pay tribute to the NGOs which have helped us to do so - then impossible things become possible , and I am delighted that they do .
in writing . - The common fisheries policy is deeply flawed , and has been extremely detrimental to the British economy and to the environment .
Rather than just promoting sustainability and energy efficiency , we need to utilise the funds to create new ways of creating energy to make cities even more self @-@ sufficient sufficient , rather than importing fuel or building nuclear power stations , as we were saying previously .
Again I agree and , in particular , I would like to point out that some specific guidelines and frameworks in the area of state aid are almost explicitly aimed at sustainable development , for example those aimed at supporting renewable energies , employment creation and research and development .
These decisions have consequences for the Palestinians and the Lebanese , as we have seen .
I also believe it is important that we keep control over decisions concerning our tax affairs and social security matters .
I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur and the parliamentary committees which worked very hard and very rapidly .
I was proud of the EU when it imposed sanctions on Austria when the new coalition formed because of the views and actions of the Freedom Party : a party whose policies have xenophobia running through them like B@@ lack@@ pool through rock ; a leader who has pra@@ ised H@@ it@@ ler and the W@@ af@@ f@@ en S@@ S , refused to condemn terrorist bombings against Roma and congratulates N@@ az@@ i war veter@@ ans for keeping to their principles .
I regret , Commissioner , that you did not fulfil your task .
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework .
Do they have any say if , for example , Poland were to join with specific derogations which , as far as the EFTA countries were concerned , undermined the EEA agreement ?
I thank the rapporteur and the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath Plath , for their judici@@ ous and efficient handling of this important file and for their very constructive and cooperative attitude during this second reading .
Without Arab unity it will be very difficult to make progress in Gaza and in the wider Middle East peace process .
In the area of access to justice we need mutual recognition to be accompanied by common minimum standards and it would have been good to see something about the rights of people to get bail when they are criminal defendants in a state other than their own .
Robert Por@@ t@@ man asked why the European Parliament was there and what the Members were doing .
Let me remind you of how the European mandate was determined .
Thank you , Commissioner , and thank you to all speakers in this important debate on a particularly relevant topic .
As the Commission has emphasised in its recent submission to the European Convention , we think that the separation between the three pillars causes numerous difficulties and should therefore be abandoned .
Member States will be required to notify sites if they have not already done so within an agreed timetable , and to guarantee formally that they will not undertake action leading to the deterioration of potential Natura 2000 sites .
We do not want to damage the EU air transport industry and the public &amp; quot ; s reasonable expectation of cheaper air travel .
I am very happy to note that overall Parliament and the Commission have reached similar conclusions on EU @-@ China China relations over the past three years and how they should develop in future .
De@@ ta@@ iled analysis and argu@@ mentation on this matter can be found , for example , in the Commission &amp; apos ; s EMU @ 10 report of 2008 .
In addition we can positively consider the second part of the amendment regarding the derogations on distance .
There have been a number of issues raised today .
While any declaration from the Commission in this context is non @-@ binding binding , it may play a role in the purpose of interpretation of the ECJ on this subject , if per@@ chance this legislation , which has already s@@ pan@@ ned two legisl@@ atures , gets a fourth reading at the Court in Luxembourg , as was my concern from the start .
Only a political solution and national reconciliation can restore civil peace and enable economic activity to resume .
Mr President , I should like to say at the outset that I welcome without reservation Mr I@@ mb@@ en@@ i &amp; apos ; s extremely constructive report .
A number of speakers raised particular issues to which I should like to respond .
I have put this question to the Commission on a number of occasions .
While we are critical of human rights violations around the world , we must apply the same scrutiny to what is going on within the borders of the European Union .
It was interesting to hear what the Commission said in relation to modern agriculture that these residues are an unavoidable factor .
The establishment of a free trade area would have dramatic consequences for working people in the region .
The EU of 25 should declare such acts absolutely unacceptable , especially by the country currently holding the Presidency of the Council of Europe .
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90 / 4@@ 24 .
So I appreciate , after all those years , what a consequ@@ ential step it has been to build the only multinational parliament in the world elected by universal suffrage .
You cannot combat terrorism with anti @-@ terror terror laws that create the same feelings of insecurity .
I want to underline to you that the Council has always reiterated its commitment to combating terrorism effectively , using all legal means available , because terrorism itself is a threat to a system of values based on the rule of law .
That is the course we shall pursue and I am grateful to Parliament for its support for it .
I would like to thank Parliament , because I think it has made a great contribution to this .
I hope our groups in this House can work together effectively to try to strike the correct balance and achieve that consensus and I hope that , at the end of the consultation period , the College of the Commission will take note of that and produce a balanced consensual package .
As a second step , following the establishment of the three new European financial supervisory agencies , the regulation of credit rating agencies will be strengthened by the introduction of centralised supervision by the European Supervisory Markets Authority .
Could I say to Mr Wa@@ ide@@ lich that I am grateful for the comment that he made in his supplementary .
The EU position on settlements is clear : settlements are illegal , they constitute an obstacle to peace , and they threaten to make a two @-@ state state solution impossible .
We believe that dialogue is the most promising means to exert a positive influence on Israel .
The Human Rights Con@@ tact Group has already brought together representatives of non @-@ governmental governmental organisations , Members of Parliament , civil servants from the EU institutions and others to discuss key concerns for Geneva .
Much will depend on whether the exclusion is due to restrictive practice or whether it is a unilateral exclusion .
With respect to Amendments 19 and 33 , which ask for the inser@@ tion of provisions for financial support for temporary fishing bans and for fishermen affected by the prohibition of certain fishing gear , the Commission believes that these proposals are not appropriate here , either because there are already rules on these matters under Community legislation and / or because these issues are to be dealt with in the framework of the European fisheries fund proposal .
Some , including the Commission , estimate it to be about EUR 20 billion per year .
On the figures , this is an ongoing discussion .
That really must be taken seriously .
I do not believe that there is a faith amongst people in the Member States that in fact what we r@@ he@@ tor@@ ically commit ourselves to we are prepared financially to commit ourselves to .
It follows that the Commission does not accept Amendment No 27 .
It is not about the European Parliament being sidelined .
In my regular contacts with both Georgia and Russia , I am indeed urging pragmatism and an end to the setting of mutually exclusive conditions : these will not work .
We have huge concerns about that .
The Commission will therefore continue to work for a comprehensive and balanced Doha deal .
In addition to the recitals , the text of the guidelines has been reinforced in key areas of importance to Parliament .
Mr President , most people speaking here today talk about how &amp; apos ; the precautionary principle must be respected , but ... &amp; apos ; .
I would ask the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office whether she would take into consideration the initiative taken by both Ireland and the UK in relation to technical conservation measures and see that some effort is made by all countries to try to ensure that the smaller fish are not taken on board .
It is against this background that I invite you to look at the present proposal .
It is not sufficient that we should simply say everybody is welcome , because I believe there is a limit to the matters of EU enlargement and this should be thought about now .
. Mr President , the Commissioner is of course new to this saga , but unfortunately for many of our constituents , both in the UK and elsewhere , this is a long @-@ running running tragedy that , as we have seen , dates back to the 1970s .
That is why we have very recently come up with the SET Plan and we are also urging Member States to devote more resources to financing green technologies , in other words , all the technology that can enable us to become a more sustainable , greener economy .
The@@ reby Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation within the framework of world history , and its capacity for creative political imagination for its future development .
I thank Ms H@@ all for her wide @-@ ranging ranging report and I commend it to colleagues .
We continue to have very serious problems with countries that have not signed the Hague Convention and where there are still a number of abduction cases .
I am confident this will be endorsed by the European Council this week , although the precise cont@@ ours will have to be worked out over the coming weeks .
The motion for a Parliamentary Resolution aims to promote increased legislative intervention across Member States that pos@@ s@@ ess such acts by considering their mutual recognition and application in specific areas .
As a general means of improving the situation , we propose that authorities in Member States should produce action plans in close consultation with the public .
I recommend we approve this report .
I regret the withdrawal of the American delegation . This certainly did not do it a particular service in view of its own record on racism in its own country .
That is curious for a report that has been ready for a year and a half and has been envisaged for some time that it be taken in conjunction with this main report of mine , the general revision .
Member of the Commission . - The Commission is still of the opinion that there is a window of opportunity for a positive outcome of the Doha negotiations in the very close future , as I mentioned in my previous answer .
So this is the way to go and this is what we are trying to do .
At the same time , the EU is providing support in order to improve governance and promote reforms in the field of justice through cooperation and technical assistance .
I am going to reply to the Members &amp; apos ; proposals through my comments and my justification for rejection or approval of the amendments .
For these reasons - the lack of transparency and the lack of safety for consumers - I recommend rejection of this compromise .
May I suggest a compromise that was used by your fellow Vice @-@ President President , Alejo Vidal @-@ Quadras Quadras , the last time that this happened , which is to allow people to make explanations of vote one person after another , which speeded up proceedings very considerably .
Member of the Commission . - In reply to Mr Pap@@ as@@ tamkos , let me refer to the report in 2005 .
Our pensions proposals , mean@@ while , fulfil our undertaking to guarantee the long @-@ term term actuarial balance of the system and , naturally , existing pension rights will be honoured .
In the current global circumstances , Europe cannot afford to do that .
I am sure the honourable Member from Northern Ireland who placed this question heard me unequivocally answer the question that he has put .
First of all , the democratic principles : pursuing constitutional reform , where reform of the rules governing political parties is essential in view of the experiences of last year , this year and previous years , when we have seen the pitfalls of the constitutional framework of Turkey in this regard , as pointed out by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe .
Given the substantial lead @-@ in in time for the equipment of posts and training , there is real urgency to adopt this regulation as soon as possible .
in writing . - I voted for this resolution , which approves the appointment of A@@ dam Far@@ k@@ as as Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority ( European Ban@@ king Authority ) .
One of the outstanding issues is setting the rights of ethnic and religious minorities - Kurds , Christians , A@@ lev@@ ists and others .
I am , of course , in favour of measures that would genuinely enhance security .
We cannot condone any violence , including the recent suicide attack which has been referred to .
The EQ@@ F has very much been built on a consensus and we have sought to carry stakeholders with us throughout the process .
. The British Conservative delegation strongly supports genuine human rights and the need for the UN Commission on Human Rights to take a robust position to overcome abuses in many parts of the world .
Another question that has been repeatedly touched upon is child labour . I think it is fair to make a distinction between child labour in manufacturing and child labour in agriculture .
In the face of Gad@@ da@@ fi &amp; apos ; s retaliation against his people , the EU must exercise the responsibility to protect by helping to enforce a no @-@ fly fly zone , as envisaged by the Arab League , the O@@ IC and the African Union , and the other measures decided on by the Security Council , with all means available , including CSDP assets - please note , Mrs Ashton - namely , to enforce the arms embargo .
This is a truly unacceptable state of affairs .
Respec@@ ting &amp; apos ; - and I stress this - &amp; apos ; respecting the role of the different institutions and the need to meet Europe &amp; apos ; s objectives , the European Council will discuss at its next meeting how to ensure that spending at the European level can make an appropriate contribution to this work &amp; apos ; .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like to start by thanking Mr S@@ z@@ á@@ jer for the very high quality report because we in the Commission appreciate very much the support Parliament has indicated for the horizontal approach to the delegated acts .
My final point is a criticism of the Council , not merely of the fact it is not present today but of the fact that - just as the UK Independence Party was doing a second or two ago - it is trying to create the illusion that everything is the fault of the Commission or the other EU institutions .
She has not , alas , been able to stay with us for the end of the debate , but I will examine the point that she made and we will certainly ensure that the delegation to which she referred gets as much help as is required .
We think a light regulation is the way forward but , I repeat , if we do not get satisfactory progress through that means , we will demand a directive and request legal intervention in this area .
Madam President , the European Union is a solution in search of a problem .
The broad sweep of history is on the side of the European Union .
These issues need to be addressed and those responsible brought to justice .
We could and should do our work better .
The only way forward is to create flo@@ ating structures , ad hoc teams , the horizontal , interoper@@ able sharing of information and cross @-@ agency agency and cross @-@ state state cooperation , and to empower Europol and Eurojust .
I need your guidance , as I know it is late procedurally , Mr President , but we need to be sure that what we do and vote on today makes sense and is fac@@ tually correct .
This House is not the place to condemn or approve actions of other Hou@@ ses .
These are electoral reform and other concrete actions towards respect for democratic values , the rule of law , human rights and fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression and of the media , and freedom of assembly and political association .
I will discuss with Ministers on Monday the political framework in which the European Union will be ready to address the most pressing needs , but of course , today , I am very interested to hear the views of the honourable Members on this matter .
The Austrian Presidency has proven over the last few months that when you deal with a particular issue in a certain way you can achieve success .
In the fight for security from terrorism , we have rightly pro@@ claimed that we are defending fundamental values but , if we compromise individual rights in the pursuit of security , we will have sacrific@@ ed some of what we hold so dear .
I should confirm that the compromise amendments are - should you decide to keep them on the table - acceptable to the Commission .
We have a whole series of inter@@ locking problems with the whole question of a free market and the idea of protecting the interests of those who are dependent on fisheries in a particular area .
Secondly , I think - and this has been said by Mr López before - politicians have no business interfering in Court rulings .
Ireland needs to govern for Ireland , and is guided by the WHO .
The implementation of the guidelines on the &amp; apos ; open coordination method &amp; apos ; is the correct way forward , as it involves national parliaments fully in the discussions and adoption of national employment plans .
We still remain on stand @-@ by by at the moment .
There are two basic reasons for this : firstly , terrorism does not stop at borders and , secondly , terrorism is a global threat : it can happen - and indeed has happened - anywhere in the world .
I am sure I am not alone in receiving correspondence from many constituents worried that an unforeseen consequence of this policy could be the deci@@ m@@ ation of tropical rain@@ forest to make way for biofuel mono@@ cultivation .
Madam President , I am conscious that this report is very controversial and that striking a compromise within this House can , at times , become extremely difficult , yet we should still try to keep our debates balanced and factual .
At the same time , I am from the part that believes that we need defined sustainability criteria and we will do this in this directive , because the counter @-@ argument argument could be that there already is water legislation , waste legislation and soil legislation .
As a long @-@ term term perspective , we have to say that the current offensive clearly contributes to a weakening of trust between Palestinians and Israelis .
There is an assumption that low commodity costs are going to continue , often on the back of the world &amp; apos ; s poorest countries ; that we can trade in countries where we force open markets when social infrastructure and a sound public sector are not in place ; that we need to be@@ ware the si@@ ren of reciprocity if it is not amongst equals .
This might be very difficult , but by agreeing to the formal opening of negotiations the Council will send a clear message to the Turkish Government that we expect it to work assiduously to achieve the steps necessary for eventual membership .
The EU has many areas where we have tried to decouple growth from transport , energy use , whatever , and it has long been decou@@ pled from jobs .
Tar@@ gets and limited reference points must be established which will maintain the fish stock at a high enough level that the risk of stock depletion or collapse is in@@ significant .
This is a historic day for Northern Ireland and given your interest and support for the peace process , would you , on behalf of all Members of Parliament , send a strong message of support for the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement , wishing all the elected members well in their work of building peace for the communities of Northern Ireland .
Finally , as Mrs Malmström has said , democracy building is much more than about elections : it is about building plur@@ alist civil society .
I am sorry to repeat myself , but it is very important to stress that the CFR will be a to@@ ol@@ box by nature , and Parliament will be fully involved in the decision on which parts of the text are to be translated .
All parties must pursue a path of positive engagement , as set out by the Quartet , which includes talks with the new Palestinian Authority .
The requirement concerning the termination of unauthorised rele@@ ases also clarifies the need for a consistent response .
The Commission undertakes to take into account the spirit of Amendment No 5 .
A development I cannot support as a sovereign@@ ist .
Mr President , I am grateful to the honourable lady .
Inter@@ religious dialogue should not only be an intellectual and the@@ ological exercise , it can also activ@@ ate the silent majority to look for a common strategy on how to find harmony and peace .
Mr President , I am pleased to see so many members of the public here today because , as everyone up there can see , there are very few people down here at this time of night .
But how do you get innovation ?
In the light of this experience , and also in view of the results of the debate in the Council health group so far , I believe that it would save a lot of crucial time if the Council and Parliament did not seek to re @-@ open open this debate , but instead stayed with the blood solution , as a number of speakers have already said .
We want these commitments fl@@ es@@ h@@ ed out by a Commission action plan on renewable energies .
There are some differences in our approach to these matters , but I hope that the summit will send a positive message about the need to pursue our efforts together notably in tackling sensitive questions such as access to affordable drugs including ti@@ ered pricing .
What I said to the President of the Commission a couple of months ago was : &amp; apos ; Please do not over@@ sell what the European Council decided in December 2008 .
Of course mistakes were made .
I hope that Europe &amp; apos ; s anti @-@ terror terror laws will not end up doing the same .
Mr President , I tried to revert to the minutes before you moved on . Yesterday I was the last speaker before the vote and there was pan@@ demoni@@ um in this House with people walking in and out .
Whilst I hear what my colleague , Mrs Har@@ d@@ staff , has said , we hope that our colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will listen to what we say about the need to encourage consumer confidence in foodstuffs , which is also in the interests of the primary producers themselves .
If you are trying to keep the link between Parliament , Commission , Council and the people , you must try hard to get a quick solution to this .
In such a light , it is crucial for Europe to understand that it needs to implement its harder instruments of power .
We need to ensure technical innovation and we also need to encourage and put forward a strategy to combat social exclusion and gender inclusion .
Mr President , this is an instrument that has huge potential and could deliver an important democratic signal to Europe .
It is crucial if we are going to have a global market and a globally competitive market within the European Union that we move forward on international harmonization .
We need to provide this predictability , and in this scenario specific measures should perhaps be introduced during a transitional period in order to make the milk quota system much more flexible than it is today .
In addition to the fine balance attained , I am very satisfied to see the increased assistance for SMEs , the promotion of alternatives to animal testing , community @-@ wide wide labelling , and creation of an EU agency to manage the technical , scientific and administrative aspects of the REACH system at Community level .
The resolution rightly emphasises that sufficient funding , monitoring and NGO and civil society involvement will be vital if the V@@ P@@ As are to achieve their aims .
Had we waited 15 years ago , and hesi@@ tated in taking decisions as politicians , we would have failed .
The key issue will be the interaction between the two centres of decision making , NATO and the EU , and the impact of this on the transatlantic relationship .
This includes the right to negotiate , conclude and enforce collective agreements and to take collective action , and must not infringe upon the autonomy of social partners when exercising these fundamental rights in pursuit of social interests and the protection of workers .
But , at the same time , let us be honest .
I would argue quite strongly that we have achieved a very fair and reasonable balance of interests .
When it was agreed upon in 2002 , it was with the understanding from all sides that this measure , which would have the effect of EU citizens standing trial and being held in prison in another Member State , would be swiftly followed by measures guaranteeing their fair trial rights and guaranteeing there would be no mis@@ carri@@ ages of justice .
We should also recognise that , in seeking some sort of balance between trade issues and environmental protection , ILO standards etc , the pen@@ du@@ lum can often swing too far one way and we end up with these taking precedence over trade and condemning poor countries to even more poverty because we make it difficult for entrepreneurs in those countries to develop capacities .
I am confident that , if the European Union increased its involvement in Iraq by contributing funds , human resources and know @-@ how how in state @-@ building building , the deterioration of the country could be avoided .
Mr President , concerning the Minutes , item 2 : yesterday I brought up the subject of Norwegian salmon dumping .
During his time in office he has emphasised the Rule of Law , taking fundamental rights seriously and applying basic principles of good administration , such as transparency , responsibility and respect for citizens .
We have made that progress because we have worked together in a way which has extended stability to the region and underpinned those who are prepared brav@@ ely to argue and work for economic and political reform .
Citizens have a Treaty right to petition Parliament about whether rules are being respected .
In conclusion , the Commission welcomes the report and the many useful and constructive amendments contained therein .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I am speaking today on behalf of my colleague , Li@@ z Lynne , who is the shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group on this directive , since she cannot be with us today due to problems with flights to Strasbourg .
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents .
Last week , the Council took an important step with the adoption on 29 April of the regulation on a regime under Article 2 of Protocol 10 of the Act of Accession .
I am very glad that representatives of the Council are here .
Let us help the pockets of poverty ; one programme , one region , yes , but targeted help from Objective II within the region at below NUTS III level .
Given that this is only a first phase agreement , it was key to have some clear perspectives for the second and more ambitious phase .
Clearly , because international investment is an area that is extremely competitive , one of the things that will happen is that , although it is an OECD agreement , there will be severe pressure on other nations looking for international investment to become signatories as well .
Linked to that is the development programme that the Commission is working on to try and support the economy in Somalia so that it improves .
If we cannot rely on the Azerbai@@ j@@ ani Government to stay true to its commitment to democracy , human rights and the rule of the law through the various agreements it has itself signed with the EU , then Europe cannot consider Azerbaijan to be a credible partner at all ; this is also true of trade relations .
Mr Cunha &amp; apos ; s report would probably mean a second reform and we could not accept it .
( The President noted that there was no opposition to the tabling of this oral amendment )
Member of the Commission . - Part of the programme is to focus attention on people contact , with young people and with students .
rapporteur . - Mr President , Commissioners , dear colleagues - also those who are leaving the room right now - this report was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ( ECON ) and it is the fruit of a joint effort of all political groups .
It was adopted by a large majority in committee and some of the supporters of the Conservatives and Christian Democrats may not appreciate their failure to be part of that majority .
Incre@@ as@@ ingly , it comes from beyond our borders and the response of our institutions has been uncertain .
I note in terms of the future that the legislative proposal for regional policy from 2007 explicitly embr@@ aces an urban dimension and , within the competitiveness and employment objective for which my region will qualify , there is a commitment to concentrate on areas which have the most serious problems .
I think the exchange from that has been very valuable .
I hope this kind of support will maintain this very important committee .
We need reinforced and rigorous economic governance to achieve stable and sustainable growth , which is critical for the employment and welfare of our citizens .
The initiative &amp; quot ; s secretariat is hou@@ sed within the Commission .
Lastly , as I have already stated , it is correct to say that the European Fisheries Fund provides for Member States to allocate public aid so as to restructure fishing fleets in line with MSY strategies .
As I indicated in my speech I would much prefer that we kept to the original Commission text unless the Commission gave us some extremely compelling reasons for those two changes .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I can tell you that the ce@@ real market outlook is clearly at the forefront of our minds , as we are in a situation where the prices have shown unprecedented growth in the recent months .
At the same time , the Commission recognises the importance of ensuring the timely provision to citizens of a full and clear evaluation of the outcome of work done with the Member States in EU Pilot , and it is committed to ensuring that complainants have an opportunity to comment on the outcome .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank everyone for all the comments .
Thank you again for your comments .
That is exactly what I am here for : to learn from your suggestions and your criticisms so as to be able to carry forward the work of the Ombudsman , the better to serve citizens in the future .
Recently , group leaders from Parliament went to visit the Head of State of a democratic country , the Czech Republic .
First , a network of judicial authorities and personnel to ease cross @-@ border border procedures in civil and commercial matters .
You can rest assured that all Commission departments are mobilised in their particular areas to investigate what can be done in this regard .
Our debate on future financing must also consider how we can enhance the priority which we attach to promoting the principle of sustainability in respect of future growth and development .
We can all recall that the Kyoto Accord sets down a timetable for the reduction in the level of the use of greenhouse gases .
To begin with , and the Commission has done this fairly well - after promp@@ ting by Parliament - key barriers had to be removed and benchmarks set for their removal .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Yes , Madam President , I never make anything not on behalf of my political group !
That is why I have studied the events which prompted criticism and unease on the part of Members of Parliament over the question of better regulation .
This is also important in order to protect the rights of individuals .
The strengthened oversight of remedies by the Commission , supported by BER@@ EC , will consolidate the single market by improving the consistency and the quality of implementation of the framework across Europe and ensure that operators have a level playing field .
This will give a further boost to our relations .
This Commissioner &amp; apos ; s role would be to promote the dialogue about that philosophy and to help create a world in which there is no longer any war or any conflict .
We should not underestimate the length of the journey that we are beginning today by starting on this legislation .
I also want to see maximum regional flexibility permitted within the regulation .
As regards the new amendments which have been re@@ submitted after the committee vote , I am not in favour of Mr Tannock &amp; apos ; s Amendment No 1 , but I approve Amendments Nos 2 to 9 .
Ad@@ di@@ tional financing depends at present on the don@@ ating and receiving Member States .
Paragraph 10 states that the distribu@@ tive tr@@ ades , small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises , suffer disproportionately from over @-@ regulation regulation as a result both of European Community directives and of national regulations .
The Ukraine does not wish to increase its dependence of supplies from Russia and therefore it wished to complete the reactors at K@@ h@@ mel@@ n@@ it@@ ski and R@@ ov@@ no and in their eyes we have been rather slow in operating the memorandum of understanding that was concluded in 1995 .
Before I set out the Commission &amp; apos ; s position regarding the amendments voted through by Parliament on 16 September , I hope you will allow me to stress that the Commission has tried to examine Parliament &amp; apos ; s suggestions in the same spirit that I am sure Parliament made them : how we can best deliver our collective European effort on the ground in Kosovo and in the region as a whole .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to say a few words about the long @-@ term term anch@@ ov@@ y plan , but I would first like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Bilbao , and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries , for their work on this proposal .
The European Parliamentary Labour Party is pleased to have been able to inject a degree of balance and impartiality into this report , which was severely lacking in the first draft presented to Committee .
For these reasons , I must support the rapporteur in her conclusions and have decided to vote in favour of the report .
I feel we must exercise extreme caution in any decisions relating to this area .
In order to answer that question , it was necessary to obtain information from the US side , in particular as regards the use of the data and the conditions under which they would be processed .
I have been the rapporteur on a substantial number of Directives concerning the liberalisation of the telecommunications industry and I , and my colleagues , have acted in good faith in this work and had assumed that the former Commissioner Bangemann had done the same .
The two previous speakers would seem to accept the opposite .
Perhaps we need to look at funding under rural development or the common agricultural policy and establish a hardship fund to look after cases like this which are there and which need assistance .
Everybody will calm down as the medium @-@ term term review becomes clearer , but that is a message we need you to take back to the governments .
The si@@ ck@@ ening crimes she suffered are made all the more shocking by the bizarre details of this case : the cro@@ wd of one thousand people ; the venu@@ e of a sta@@ dium , as though it was some kind of spec@@ ta@@ tor sport ; the truc@@ k@@ load of stones or@@ dered speci@@ ally for the purpose ; the gun@@ men who fi@@ red at people trying , to their credit , to save this poor gir@@ l &amp; apos ; s life .
These are very complex issues . We might solve a problem in one place and create another elsewhere .
Mr President , I too think it is a wise decision and it shows that it is right that there be flexibility in this rule .
This cannot be allowed to happen .
However , we should not forget that the absence of subjective and comparable cen@@ sus data would lead to negative consequences .
But what also caught my eye is that this training is aimed at supporting and developing a European approach in the field of crime @-@ fighting fighting and protecting internal security .
Some Member States outside the euro area are also involved in balance of payment support programmes through the Commission and the IMF .
Thus , the European Parliament took the only possible position on this indiscriminate and inhumane weapon : a united &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; to cluster munitions in Europe and throughout the world .
Vice @-@ Chairman Chairman of the S &amp; amp ; D Group . - I will indeed work on those Member States .
I voted for rejection of the Commission proposal on &amp; apos ; humane &amp; quot ; tr@@ apping standards .
When it is based on a Constitution that confers powers on the European Union with the agreement of every single Member State on the ratification of treaties ?
Finally , we have to ensure that the European Union remains an attractive market for developing countries , and offer our ACP partners the necessary financial assistance to adapt to these unavoidable changes .
The core issue we are dealing with here in this report is whether to include , or exclude , self @-@ employed employed drivers from the Working Time Directive .
I want to thank him for the work he has done at a time when he was enormously engaged in the REACH proposals , which are now before our committee .
Madam President , in relation to the enlargement reports - not just Mr Brok &amp; apos ; s report , but also those on the individual applicant states - it is interesting to see that Mr Brok has recognised the rejection of the Nice Treaty in Ireland .
Since the Commission is the body which initi@@ ates legislation , I urge you , Commissioner , to consider acting on the findings of any such inquiry you may care to set up .
We need the Charter of Fundamental Rights ; we need a legal personality ; we need a foreign minister ; we need more qualified @-@ majority majority voting and we need more codecision .
A number of Member States made it clear that they were opposed to Article 235 as the legal base for the programme .
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first .
I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proxim@@ ity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus .
We have the real prospect of cem@@ enting a deep partnership for development between the EU and the ACP .
This is not a party political issue .
Not only will I vote against these proposals , but I shall urge my government to oppose them .
I am , therefore , confident that we have the potential and will find the political will to respond to the new challenges in the perspective of the 2000 @-@ 2004 2004 European Union drugs strategy .
Thank you for your input , your cooperation and your support .
But our humanitarian concern must extend to each and every individual refugee as long as their safety is threatened , wherever they may be .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , let me first of all , on behalf of the European Commission , say that we deeply regret the assassin@@ ation of His Ex@@ cel@@ l@@ ency the President of the Republic of Guinea @-@ Bissau Bissau , Jo@@ ão Ber@@ nar@@ do Vie@@ ira .
The Commission is at present implementing , or preparing legal grounds for implementing , the different actions set out in the White Paper on reforming the Commission .
I hope to see this issue taken up by the national governments in the framework of their bilateral relations with the countries of Latin America , and European institutions within their strategic partnership , to support the prevention and protection policies relating to violence .
- Before the vote on Amendment 9@@ 90
This is a bigger step for Europe and the European Parliament as it confirms its maturity .
Finally - and I would echo the opinion which Mrs Van der Laan expressed this morning in the debate - it is necessary for us to call the Council to account now .
Madam President , we are delighted that we have this opportunity of debating this issue today .
We have a persistent and clear need to continue to work towards gre@@ ening the budget in all areas of policy activity and I want to see further work on this this year .
We have produced , I believe , a balanced report that will continue to put pressure on the authorities in Valencia .
The communication is entitled &amp; apos ; Ac@@ ting now to reinvigorate global action and climate change &amp; apos ; , and that is exactly what we aim to do .
How does this work ?
We will have the three European micro @-@ prudential prudential supervisors for banking , securities and insurance , and the European Sy@@ stem@@ ic Risk Board for macro @-@ financial financial stability and the risks associated with it .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution from the Legal Affairs committee .
The war against terrorism is also law &amp; apos ; s war against those who rise up against it . &amp; apos ;
Firstly , let me thank the rapporteur , Mr Man@@ ders , for his report concerning the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal on environmental liability .
Looking at the record of yesterday &amp; apos ; s proceedings , Amendment No 3 , which we received yesterday morning , became Amendment No 4 at the vote .
Our producers are also concerned about the prospect of duty @-@ free free entry from the 48 least @-@ developed developed countries .
I tend to say neither , but simply note that it is rather improbable that would happen .
I agree with both of them so , in principle , this should not be impossible .
The Council &amp; apos ; s position on both of these matters is clear , and indeed was set out in the declaration which I quoted in my introductory remarks .
In my view , one of the most important elements is the follow @-@ up up of legislative initiative requests from Parliament .
And , just like in the financial markets , failure to do so ends in crisis .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s action plan is part of an overall strategy to foster the efficiency and competitiveness of businesses and to strengthen shareholders &amp; apos ; rights and the protection of third parties .
We need a United Nations which reflects the shared values of ordinary people and which delivers them .
At a time when the European Union is expanding to include ten new countries and when these countries are making stringent efforts to encourage economic growth , we have a duty at least to give these countries access to resources , which the existing fifteen have had access to in the past .
You always learn a lot of new things and I can , of course , promise that I will report back to the Commission .
We will be able to agree on a whole range of measures to break down administrative barriers to renewable energy penetration and ensure its access to the electricity and energy networks .
The Commission has already made a proposal for a new financial regulation laying down some common rules and we will put forward some specific proposals in the course of 2011 .
Mr President , honourable Members , I have asked for the floor at this point because I believe it is important that I share with you my analysis of the current situation and that I convey to you my position at this stage of our debate .
En@@ ough already . &amp; apos ;
With that guarantee also comes the responsibility for banks to now start lending to businesses and to people , to allow the economies to pick up again .
But apparently , from the disappointing reply from the Commissioner , it is still a question of &amp; apos ; if &amp; apos ; .
If Europe does not supply the live cattle requirements , other countries will ; and surely we must have on our agenda the objective of maxim@@ iz@@ ing the full potential of European agriculture .
The Commission stands ready to work towards a rapid solution that is agreed by all the institutions concerned .
Mr President , a couple of small but important wording errors have managed to cre@@ ep into the resolution .
Yesterday evening my colleague , Mr Solbes , told Parliament that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 13 and 14 .
It is important to recall that the Commission directive which aimed at introducing a single Community @-@ wide wide scheme for withholding interest at source did not obtain the unanimous consent of the Council .
I welcome the Commission &amp; apos ; s initiative in this area .
But what the Con@@ nec@@ ti@@ cut Y@@ an@@ ke@@ e did understand - I quote from the motion for a resolution - &amp; apos ; takes the view that the convergence of telecommunications media and information technology sectors must be reflected in European rule @-@ making making in such a way that inter @-@ operability operability of various technologies is not hampered &amp; apos ; .
Since Lisbon , successive European Councils have called on the Commission , Council and Parliament to ensure that the new framework is in place by the end of this year .
But there has been an industrial lobby which has created a blocking minority in Council , and for that reason the rapporteur and the committee reluctantly agreed to allow the Member States a derogation for professional use .
So too is our internal market - our greatest European achievement - and the reason we have state aid control in first place .
It is human nature to be the more affected by a tragedy the closer it comes to one .
I wish to thank the Committee on Petitions , and especially the chair , Mrs Maz@@ zoni .
The Nep@@ al@@ ese people have suffered a legacy of human rights abuses , both from the security forces and from the Ma@@ o@@ ist reb@@ els .
However , I have concerns about the situation where we are making decisions for approval of a particular substance based on whether that substance is a hazard or not , and we are not taking possible exposure into account .
The Commission is going to do its best to ensure that during the next fishing season the sustainability of the stocks will be protected .
The signing of the Accession Treaty before the end of the year is being envisaged .
There are many points of detail in the report which are particularly controversial , not least the idea of European Union embassies and the suggestion that the European Union should have &amp; quot ; coordinated representation in international bodies such as the UN &amp; quot ; .
Mr President , the European Parliament has a strong record of condemning violations in Chile under the former military dictatorship of General Pinochet and of welcoming the return to civilian rule and the genuine progress which is being achieved in the observance of human rights in that country .
The Irish and UK governments have , for many years , sty@@ mi@@ ed progress on European wide protection for temporary agency workers who have suffered discrimination in their working conditions and their right to belong to a trade union .
Apart from education , inter@@ religious dialogue constitutes one of the principal means of preventing misunderstandings , conflicts and violations in the area of freedom of religion or belief .
Paragraph 2 , as he said in his speech , sets out Parliament &amp; apos ; s priorities , especially in relation to job creation . That has to be at the forefront of all our minds .
Such exclu@@ sions would affect the sale of a large number of insurance products involving important risks .
This is an ambitious but achievable timetable and all sides are committed to moving forward .
Mar@@ k R@@ ow@@ land of Ju@@ bi@@ le@@ e Camp@@ aign will be absolutely delighted that the European Parliament has joined the UN in condemning his treatment .
Secondly , we must have a common system of accounting - used by all Member States , based on a standardised and internationally accepted method of accounting , and agreed between the Member States , Commission and Parliament .
Well , everyone is against that .
Finally , it calls on the OSCE to further strengthen its capacity to ensure respect for and the implementation of principles and commitments undertaken by its participating states in all three dimensions , inter alia , by enhancing follow @-@ up up mechanisms .
Therefore , what we have to do is continue our ongoing work and never lose sight of our long @-@ term term projects .
We should certainly continue the dialogue between the Council , Member States , Parliament and the Commission .
Under the Directive , the host Member State may exp@@ el European citizens also if they no longer fulfil the conditions attached to their right of residence .
Mr President , in my introductory statement I already approached many of the issues which have been again brought forward in Parliament this afternoon .
We will be able to agree on a world @-@ leading leading set of sustainability criteria for biofuels used to achieve this target .
This would obviously increase synergies , legitimacy and administrative simplification , but we have not been very successful over the years .
I do not know where that is coming from .
However , that demonstrates the strength and the unity of concern in this Parliament about this issue and our serious determination to do something more about it .
Taking them in order , I look first at the report by Mr Varela . The Commission played an active part in achieving the ratification of the United Nations convention relating to the conservation and management of str@@ add@@ ling stocks , which the Commission believes represents a concrete step towards the protection and sustainable exploitation of resources .
In conclusion , we should explore as many ways as possible for le@@ vering extra investment into development , but the methods we choose must have public support and they must never be co@@ ver@@ t .
It is a reality that we have to deal with .
Yet , at the same time , economic and trade relations between the European Union and Russia are strong , and getting stronger .
That is a step towards finding a constitutional settlement .
To me their future security and the security of their children h@@ inges upon reaching a suitable settlement so that we can expand the European Union to those Central and European states .
Nevertheless we are here now , and the Socialist Group supports the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s recommendation for adoption of this regulation with the minimum of amendments , already agreed in principle with the Council , in order to allow a fast @-@ track track , one @-@ reading reading approval of the extension , and in reality to allow refugee support projects this year to go ahead rather than be cancelled .
I need to make it clear - and I do so without in any way suggesting a lack of interest in this problem which rightly is of considerable concern to many Members of the House - that the European Commission does not have competence in a number of the areas which are raised in this report .
In addition , the Commission proposes to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties .
We therefore have the crisis we have at the moment .
This potential can be unle@@ ash@@ ed through increased competition and mobility in the industry across the EU .
This topic has been the subject of debate for a long time : sometimes he@@ ated , sometimes mis@@ represented , sometimes taken in the wrong way .
The EU is also making a huge contribution and also the agricultural sector already contributes in the fight against climate change .
To preserve confidence in quality schemes , it is necessary to implement them with reinforced controls and traceability systems .
I would like to respond to four questions which were put during the course of the debate .
In Parliament , we call for the Commission to cooperate with governments , customs authorities , industry and consumers in all EU Member States .
. Consumers are entitled to demand that the food they buy and eat is as safe as it can be , and I fully support that principle but , in our anxiety to put in place regulations which will work , giving consumers the guarantees they require , we should not throw out existing measures which are already proving effective .
It is time that we looked at how we recognise what we call national sovereignty and how we treat so @-@ called called independent nations .
Madam President , I join those who said that a democratic opening has enabled the kind of progress we have not seen in some years and generated development where , some years ago , we thought this would be impossible .
The role of the United Nations in conflict situations around the globe provides us with many examples from which we can learn and build upon to define the EU peacekeeping role .
The first article of the EC @-@ Vietnam Vietnam Cooperation Agreement which we signed with the government of Vietnam in 1995 states that respect for human rights and democratic principles is the basis for our cooperation .
I would echo what has been said by our colleague , Ms Bauer , in terms of our own Member States taking action to sign and ratify some of the conventions and protocols which are missing at the moment .
in writing . - Members of this House will be well aware of my views in the past with regard not only to Kosovo , but to the whole Balkan region .
Of course we are concerned about the outbreak of animal and bir@@ d diseases in other parts of the world and we make sure that we respond properly to those issues .
I believe , as the President of the Commission was saying this morning , that the most recent evidence from the global economy is that the market can produce those goods and I think that is something around which we can unite and indeed prosper .
We need both to get a better understanding of where our partners stand on key issues and to explain what the EU requires from a global deal .
We will have a follow @-@ up up on all of this and also the details that you have mentioned , which I think belong more to the dialogue between committees and Commissioners .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the report on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and I am happy with its contents .
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe , then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report , because it will deliver those jobs , and it will deliver those opportunities , and it is the only way to do so .
We can all see the incredibly sensitive situation in Europe and especially in the eurozone which has required different countries to work together in a way that has never been seen before .
in writing . - The ECR Group is wholeheartedly supportive of the inclusion and integration of the Roma people within Member States and the European Union .
I welcome your report , Mrs Svensson , and I welcome this important initiative ; it provides the possibility to cooperate , exchange views and create synergies between what the Commission is doing and what the European Parliament is doing in order to define future action in this area .
We could adopt the easy way .
In this debate I will restrict my comments to the issue of coherence and the linkage between regional policy and competition policy .
I have made a commitment to Parliament ; I will not tell people what to eat .
Unfortunately , we do not believe that additional restrictive measures will push the Government in the desired direction or will alleviate the suffering of the people .
Terroris@@ ts choose violence rather than the ballot box , inflic@@ ting death and pain on innocent civilians , justi@@ fying their actions by flying the ban@@ ner of religion , race or political sovereignty .
But I want to congratulate the minister first of all this morning for remaining ambitious about Copenhagen and sticking to the idea of a legally binding agreement .
We also want to prevent and combat illegal fishing and promote the development of port infrastructures and the protection of the marine environment .
Mr President , the European Union should combat the illegal drugs trade and support a genuine peace process in Colombia but it cannot , must not , should not , do so by cooperating with Plan Colombia .
In short , the Greens consider that a rigorous programme of fleet reduction accompanied by compensation for the fishermen thus affected is a fundamental prerequisite for resolving the current crisis .
I am , of course , very well aware of your concerns on democracy and human rights in Tajikistan and I can therefore assure you that the Commission will take these concerns fully into account in our dialogues with this country .
As with Bulgaria , Romania must address concerns over the implementation of the European Union &amp; quot ; s external border requirements and procedures , and concerns over the effective enforcement of intellectual property rights .
But our strategy also includes commitments in areas such as employment and social policy , agriculture , research and regional policy .
Although I support much of what the rapporteur proposes , I still have concern over the issue of the centre .
These national priority programmes paved the way for transition across a range of different sectors and we need now to support them , which is precisely what our action plan is doing .
The European Union of 27 democracies has an original way of electing a President of the Commission precisely because we are not a state .
I am quite amaz@@ ed at the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s answer .
The European Union has repeatedly underlined the need for the judicial system to be seen to operate fairly and transparently if it is to command the confidence of both the Russian population and the international community .
In conclusion , let me reiterate my position so that there can be no mistake : I respect the right of the Jewish people to have their own state , but the Jewish Government must respect the right of the Palestinian people to have theirs .
As you all know , the temporary agreement concluded in October with the United States will ex@@ pire by the end of July this year , in a few months &amp; apos ; time .
New members will arrive here with enlargement in this Parliament , many of them representing former member nations of union states .
Madam President , I welcome this directive , as it will primarily help energy users to reduce and monitor their electricity consumption .
What I would like to see coming out of much of the concern about employment at the moment is a very coherent package as regards new industries and new investment .
Let us at least ensure that such injustices do not go unnoticed .
Others have tro@@ d in our foot@@ steps - Javier Solana has been there , Tony Blair has finally made it , and the President of Parliament has been there to see for himself the circumstances in which Palestinians are now living .
These are debates that will come later this afternoon .
Mr President , I wish to express my support and the support of my group for the rapporteur and the amendments retabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
I know that will not please colleagues in my Group , but we have to live in the real world and recognise the limits of our competencies .
I commend the electorate of the Irish Republic for exercising good sense in the first referendum , sense that I believe that they will show once again in the second one .
However , like Mrs Theorin , I disagree with paragraphs 15 and 19 , on the integration of the WEU in the EU and more majority voting in the common foreign and security policy .
This is exactly what we want to achieve , and I think that we have reason to believe that the outcome of the meeting in Prague in the presence of the Commission , the Presidency , the upcoming presidencies and the social partners will be able to produce results in the form of recommendations and suggestions .
I know that we will have a very good advertising and information campaign , and that we will capture the imagination of the citizens of Europe .
In particular there are three areas where urgent action is required :
Over the next few months - until November and then the European Council meeting in December - we should look into how and whether we should formulate some transitional claims at the top of membership as of 1 January .
We will not have the entire picture until the relevant da@@ ughter directives are in place over the next few years .
Perhaps the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office could reassure us on this point .
In February 2007 the European Commission proposed a directive ( COD / 2007 / 00@@ 22 ) that obliges Member States to treat serious offences against the environment as criminal acts and to set minimum sanctions for environmental crimes such as waste crime .
I have made that point here in this Parliament on many occasions and I am happy to repeat it now .
I have been here throughout this discussion .
I should like to suggest that the Bureau at some time look into the question of whether a Member who limits a first supplementary to under half a minute is allowed a second question .
I would like to address the issue of the broad economic guidelines and address my remarks in particular to the Commissioner and the representatives from the Commission .
This programme is important because Europe must be , and is , more than just big business and capital , moving money about Europe and people getting richer and richer .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , I am certainly aware that the issue of Guantánamo has been a subject of great concern to this Parliament .
That is what we have to ask ourselves : can the common agricultural policy really cope with the challenges it faces at the present time ?
What plans does the Presidency have to start a dialogue with Parliament upon security and defence questions , and when will the Presidency &amp; apos ; s Minister of Defence make a statement upon the development of a common policy for European security and defence ?
I would like to express my strong support for the report .
Otherwise there is no point in having this principle of mutual recognition of national decisions within the European Union .
Finally , the EU can guide authorities towards solutions that are interoper@@ able and facilitate smo@@ other functioning of the single market .
I just need a ruling on that and to know which rule you will be speaking to .
In reality we know that regulating the e @-@ commerce commerce world in the interests of both business and consumers requires a more innovative approach .
I wish to say , therefore , that the success of the Barcelona process is not just important to the south of Europe , but to all of Europe .
It is anticipated that this will lead to wider reforms in the Agenda 2000 mid @-@ term term review .
Mr President , it is important that we have transparent , workable directives .
I wish you every success and I am extremely glad that we have had an opportunity to raise the issue within this House because there is widespread support for it .
I should like to end by expressing the hope that in its vote Parliament will support the common position so that we can get these directives onto the statute book as quickly as possible .
This decision only increases the need for Ukraine to achieve wider constitutional reform through an inclusive constitutional reform process and , to a great extent , takes up a key theme of the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s resolution of 25 February this year .
It leads to a balanced solution offering a genuine benefit to animal welfare , whilst safeguarding consumer health and taking into account the impact of our internal decisions at international level .
We must ensure that the trade agreements which we undertake with the ACP countries are favourable to their interests and , crucially , that they are undertaken as tools for development .
rapporteur . - Mr President , it is my pleasure to present the report on the problems and perspectives concerning European citizenship , which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs ( LIBE ) last month .
That is a good feature of his proposals .
This motion is a statement of the seriousness with which this House takes ongoing developments in our agricultural markets .
I would like to say once again to the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic : thank you very much for your presidency , for your summary and for your participation in the debate here today .
&amp; apos ; Po@@ ints out that the Commission shall publish its findings on countries that are considered not to be ready yet to join the euro area each time an evaluation is carried out , and present this to the European Parliament in order to ensure a high level of transparency and accountability in the decision @-@ making making process at EU level . &amp; quot ;
On the other hand , local culture and traditions have shaped the products available and consumers will not want any diminution of existing consumer protection standards .
Mr President , this subject has been debated in many places over many years and is of great importance , and I therefore welcome the fact that many speakers have given their opinion on it .
The rapporteur believes that these up@@ grad@@ es to the Euromed free trade agreements can contribute towards economic and political stability in this key region with a view to consolidating a single area of peace , development , justice , equality , freedom , plurality , democracy and respect .
We cannot refer to something as humanitarian action that is not necessarily what it seems .
However , I must say , Mr President , that , having taken Mr K@@ on@@ ra@@ d , whom you did - in other words , one speaker in favour , one speaker against - and then trying to stop the clear disruption in the G@@ all@@ ery , you acted with great dignity , and what followed after that was quite out of order .
I have real concerns about the amount of transactions inspec@@ ted and I also question the extent to which other auditors &amp; quot ; work is used .
This to my mind cannot continue and I hope the Commission , in cooperation with Lomé countries , is seriously looking at a feasible structure that is historically , socially and institutionally a grouping that gives a sound basis to work from .
It constitutes a key element in the international strategy to control , reduce and ultimately to eliminate the risk of nuclear conflict .
Secondly , we need to speed up , intensify and complete the regulatory reform of financial markets , bank levies , short selling and credit agencies .
What we are trying to do , via that legislation , is to guarantee the status of an international organisation which would , as a consequence , due to the VAT legislation which exists today , guarantee VAT exemption .
Its quick adoption is the Commission &amp; apos ; s priority .
At the same time , we would like Israel to respect the right of self @-@ determination determination of the Palestinian people , and we believe the best solution is for two states - Israel and the Palestinian State - to exist in full respect of each other and of international law .
The ALDE Group firmly believes that a robust and dynamic economic environment in the European Union can only come about if the new Commission commits itself to reviewing the Stability and Growth Pact so that it provides a strong bul@@ war@@ k against fiscal irresponsibility , while maintaining the necessary flexibility to ensure that Europe maxim@@ ises its growth potential without endan@@ gering price stability .
- Mr President , you could have gu@@ es@@ sed what these reports would say .
On the fiscal measures currently being envisaged by Member States , it is important to continue with sensible , balanced approaches which also do not add up to protectionism .
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disgu@@ ised form of trade protectionism .
In view of the seriousness of these allegations , which I consider to be reliable , I have decided to refer this case to the Anti @-@ fraud fraud Agency OLAF in the hope and the expectation that OLAF will launch an immediate inquiry to get to the bottom of all this .
Our fisheries policy must be understood and not just perceived as something being arbitrarily handed down by a European Union which claims to know better but cannot really prove it .
Will he give an assurance that that aspect will be taken very seriously , because Parliament wants to see the Council treat that as a priority .
We are bound together by solidarity .
In that context perhaps the institutional arrangements need to be examined .
I am not , of course , even in favour of membership of the European Union .
Part of this is related to the governance arrangements which apply to all of them .
On the contrary , the fund market has become a more diverse and complicated place .
The second point is about the importance of jobs .
The Council is looking forward to considering that issue and many others on the basis of the Commission &amp; apos ; s forthcoming proposal for the new GSP .
Women do not have equal opportunities for achievement in the high @-@ value value @-@ added added industry .
I would like to hear whether this is actually a legal procedure for us to be voting on now .
But in micro @-@ economic economic terms at the level of the salmon industry consider the implications of Norway , a state outside the Union which produces a massive surplus for export - and has the potential to produce much more in the immediate future - and floods our market to such an extent that the anti @-@ dumping dumping case when it is examined will hold .
I have to advise that is not the normal way in which we do our voting .
Without that our Community and our Union lack the clarity of purpose which will make them not merely acceptable to , but embraced by , the citizens .
In particular , I look forward to talking about some of the details , including simplification of the process , particularly for applicants .
On the issue of piracy , of course the Commission is deeply concerned that incidents are on the increase .
Let us look at this problem .
I am pleased we have been able to find a compromise at second reading between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers by working very quickly and in fact by fore@@ going the normal full procedure for codecision matters .
However , over and above representation , there are thousands of women across the EU , and indeed the world , who en@@ dure violence , exploitation and exclusion .
In many cases they do not have the civi@@ c structures and other organisations in place to properly enforce some of the regulations we would like and some of the monitoring that would take place .
To change &amp; apos ; European public prosecutor &amp; apos ; , which I regarded as bad , to &amp; apos ; European judicial authority &amp; apos ; , which I regard as even worse , and to do it by way of a corrigendum is an abuse of the House , and I look for your ruling on it .
We share America &amp; apos ; s pain about the attacks of 11 September , and not just because European citizens were among those so bru@@ tally murdered .
A diverse and pluralistic media is fundamental to democracy , freedom and cultural diversity .
I take as an example Article 3.1 ( 1 ) where the original text said : &amp; quot ; To the maximum possible extent analysis will be gender @-@ specific specific &amp; quot ; .
This is a substantial change as compared to the previous regime and comes from the intention to stabilise the macro @-@ economic economic environment which would relieve the pressure on the fiscal systems that are meant to support social protection systems and employment policies .
During the last ten years we have witnessed a remarkable transformation in that country and through change of political systems and socio @-@ economic economic reforms it has already achieved the political and economic basis for accession .
It is the long @-@ term term debate about establishing a post @-@ Kyoto Kyoto Man@@ date that would produce what the Americans correctly point out we need : &amp; apos ; a global response to a global problem &amp; apos ; .
Although hopeful I think the impact of the final statement is questionable .
I would like instead to make just a few remarks on some of the key elements of the ESDP and the common foreign and security policy , which are highlighted in the two reports .
I am not sure whether experience in the egg industry features on your lengthy C@@ V , but I wonder whether I could urge , through you , that cooperation take place between the Spanish authorities and the Commission to try and resolve the situation , so as to avoid people calling for a ban on the import of Spanish eg@@ gs .
In the context of the reduced budget , not only the breakdown but also the timing for the introduction of new initiatives may have to be considered .
My last comment relates to the comments made by our Chair in the Committee on Budgets , Alain Lamassoure .
The &amp; apos ; polluter pays &amp; apos ; principle , the principle of producer responsibility in the EU waste legislation as well as the implementation of concrete targets for prevention are important aspects of this report that I favour .
We are particularly pleased that the precautionary principle , which is held in sac@@ red regard not just by my group of MEPs but by the large majority of MEPs in Parliament in general , features promin@@ ently in this report , and this should make European consumers feel that much is being done to secure the protection of their health as regards enz@@ ymes in food .
The code of conduct has led to greater mutual understanding , greater transparency and a greater convergence of Member States &amp; apos ; policies .
As soon as we resolve the minor matters of the weighting of votes , it will come into force , I am sure .
I believe in solar ther@@ mal energy but we addressed the most urgent needs .
Mr President , the Commission was asked last week by the European Parliament to make a statement on innovative sources of financing for development cooperation .
As for the 10 % being ridiculous and shameful , I would suggest that whilst the Commission could and should have done more , that is not a result of any lack of motivation or effort .
As you know , there has been a unanimous demand from Member States to create this agency , even those under opt @-@ out out , who know that the Commission has no intention of forcing any changes in the UK opt @-@ out out .
I sincerely hope , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , that when you meet the social partners at the social summit in October , you will make real progress , because no progress can be made on the wealth and values of the European Union Member States without broad , consensus @-@ based based cooperation .
It is vital the Commission meets its obligation to come forward with a proposal on this by the end of this year , both to all@@ ay widespread public concern that some biofuels currently on the market may not be producing a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , and also for the sake of industry which is developing innovative processes whose added value deserves to be recognised .
What the Coreper is discussing in cooperation with the Council , the Commission and with Members of the European Parliament - Mr Brok and others , and I personally have also had several discussions with Mr Buzek in order to try to keep Parliament informed - is the general framework and the tasks of the External Action Service .
Members of this Parliament will be aware of the very high degree of public interest in this issue and of the lobbying to which we have all been subjected .
What we all want in this House is high animal and human health standards , and this new legislation that you promise should ensure that .
Yes , mistakes were certainly made .
I have spoken on many occasions to this Parliament about the European Union / China human rights dialogue .
Second , a subject which has been touched on in , for example , technical terms by my honourable friend , Mr Deva : the question of allocation of financial resources between Latin America and Asia The Commission proposal seeks to respect , for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 2006 , the broad 60 / 40 balance of appropriations for Asia and Latin America which has prevail@@ ed during the previous financial perspectives .
The list of legitimate interests that need to be met is very long : the hundreds of thousands of farmers who grow sugar be@@ et in the community ; the sugar producing and consuming industries and their workers ; the consumers ; and , last but not least , our trade partners , including those countries enjoying longstanding preferences .
I know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?
May I ask you if you will be putting to the House any change in these procedures so that the House can then take a democratic vote on it ?
In those circumstances , reflecting the views of those who asked us to engage in this exercise and provide this legislation , we have now come to the stage when we must lift the de facto moratorium .
Belarus , as we know , is included as one of the six Eastern Partnership countries , a move aimed at creating positive development trends in our eastern European neighbourhood .
Mr President , firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur and those MEPs who supported the abolition of registration taxes , the establishment of ref@@ und systems for car taxes and the application of fiscal measures to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and improve fuel economy .
It was the explicit aim of the United Nations and the EU that a united Cyprus would join the European Union on 1 May 2004 .
The real problem is so huge that we must di@@ g deep into our resources to continue the broader general struggle of ensuring decency triump@@ hs in a world capable of producing child labour , etc . - with or without the Olympic Games .
Let us introduce some proportionality and balance to our debates and give the issues we discuss in these human rights debates some serious consideration .
One of the things that concerns people is what this is going to mean for the future of cyber security right across the EU .
I fear that the potential consequences , should the down@@ side of the nuclear industry become more widely evident , are probably too much for some of our Member States to bear .
I therefore welcome the steps taken by Council towards an integrated approach to asylum policy and look forward to further constructive proposals in this sensitive area .
This debate must also be taken to the national capitals and we need to talk to citizens , to inform them about how this budget is structured so we can gain strong support for our ambitious proposals .
In relation to the over @-@ capacity capacity of EU fleets , I would like to ask the Commission how it feels about the announcement by the Irish Government yesterday for a EUR 56 million investment package for EU vessels ?
But most of the instruments which can affect the growth of employment are still in the hands of the Member States .
Most importantly , we have to ensure stability and public order , and while the situation has generally cal@@ med down , violence continues .
What are the concrete measures to be taken ?
But , in the meantime , we must recognise the enormous efforts that have been made by Bulgaria and Romania in order to comply with the technical requirements of Schengen .
My concerns were directed at the lack of clarity and coordination in the division of tasks between the European Agency for Reconstruction &amp; apos ; s offices and the Commission &amp; apos ; s de@@ concentrated delegations , a matter which I have addressed in my report .
His remarks , in my opinion , have given us a flavour of what we may expect in the forthcoming Commission paper .
A spur to greater global trade is a spur to greater global prosperity .
Nevertheless , the Commission has taken a more ambitious approach by proposing a directive .
It is good for jobs and growth .
Mr President , this report presented me with something of a dilemma .
However , Liberals and Democrats are convinced that the current situation cannot be resolved by the &amp; apos ; thought police &amp; quot ; , but only through dialogue .
That relationship is based upon an understanding that trade is the eng@@ ine of growth for developing countries .
Sometimes that means defending their rights from encro@@ ach@@ ment by the Union &amp; apos ; s Member States .
Finally , I should like to congratulate both the rapporteurs , Mr Elles and Mr Grech , on producing excellent reports .
Finally , on the subject of Galileo : this new budget line will do a great deal to give greater transparency and accountability .
Again , as I said at the start , we are committed to human rights , social and economic rights , which include in particular freedom of expression , religion , association and protection of the rights of minorities .
In the medium @-@ term term , we are looking to develop EU support for an effective civil registr@@ y authority .
The Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs has decided to apply the procedure without report to that proposal . I shall give the floor immediately to Mr Watson , who is Chairman of that committee , to give us its opinion .
Nonetheless , we support the aims of this directive and the work the Commissioner has done on it .
It implem@@ ents many of the policies and legislative processes agreed by the European Union .
The will of the people across Europe has been ignored , a single currency has been created , against the will of the people of Europe , and look what problems have been created .
It is more likely to direct the funding into waste and bureaucracy .
The current crisis in my opinion calls for flexibility because , unless the credit squeeze by the financial institutions is relaxed , there is every possibility that the crisis will get even worse and that more and more jobs will be lost .
This is no reflection on the Chair or the Commissioner .
I have always believed that Turkey could be a very important bridge @-@ head head between the current Members of the EU and the Islamic world .
I cannot vote for lesser price cuts , increased compensation , and less quota cuts than proposed by the Commission .
The strategy papers are multiannual programmes , decided under the DCI for example , which fulfil the criteria for the application of the delegated act procedure .
We have said that where there is a majority of over 90 % in committee , we can take that prima facie as not controversial .
We have discussed it and this is the main problem we have to solve through our CFP reform .
Mr President , first of all I think this is a very timely discussion .
Au@@ tom@@ atically increasing EU subsidies is not , perhaps , the most responsible approach when we have the practical problem of making a meaningful and efficient use of them .
Of course , there is a cost which the Commission has worked out for the package , but I do not want to go back to our citizens in a few years time and say that , because we failed to act here and now on climate change , billions more will need to be found .
We urge the Russian authorities to make every possible effort to ensure that those who work on sh@@ ed@@ ding light on violations of human rights are able to do so without fear of violence or intimidation .
We will be looking to him to safeguard the interests of the smaller Member States .
I hope , Commissioner McCreevy , that you will answer that point in your reply .
I should very much like to support what Mr Pirker has just said .
Lastly , what we are moving to is a discussion between Parliament and the Council .
I reconfirm the Commission &amp; apos ; s commitment to making use of voluntary agreements at Community level on a selective case @-@ by by @-@ case case basis only , checking them against the criteria laid down in the communication and respecting procedural requirements that ensure proper involvement of the European Parliament .
The next item is the Or@@ al Question to the Commission pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure ( B5 @-@ 0@@ 16@@ 5 0@@ 16@@ 5 / 2001 ) by Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath Plath , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on Community initiatives on the future of the pension systems , including pension funds in Europe .
The British Conservatives voted in favour of the Watson report in order to underline our continued ongoing support for the war against terrorism , and to confirm our determination to ensure that the European Union presents a united front against those who seek to undermine our values and our way of life .
It will also offer a platform for working with the Member States on the most appropriate operational structure to be put in place in future for an efficient functioning of the Customs Union .
Let me conclude by welcoming the broad support for the results of the European Council .
What was said in the debate about the role of the different participants in the markets was also very important .
The ball is now in the Council &amp; apos ; s court ; we in Parliament have performed our task and performed it very well .
Under the original proposal , non @-@ EU EU workers would get equal treatment with EU nationals as regards pay and dis@@ mis@@ sal , health and safety at work and the right to join trade unions .
The views of the clear and overwhelming majority of this House confirm to me the urgency of the task at hand .
Do you have a view on this , bearing in mind also that the Environment Agency and other national agencies welcome these proposals very much ?
The strengthening of parliamentary oversight is vital to ensure that EU development funds are put to best use and contribute effectively to achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
The Commission notes , however , the terms of the compromise supported by Council and Parliament and is therefore willing , despite our concerns , to go along with this compromise , given the importance that it attaches to the rapid establishment of the centre .
I would have nothing against a European discussion on that issue here as well .
I really believe we have a responsibility towards our citizens to choose the path of growth with jobs .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , first of all I want to pay tribute to the Council and congratulate them for their efforts , particularly with regard to Russia and the situation in Georgia .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I would have liked to start this debate by talking about the case of A@@ min@@ at@@ ou Hai@@ dar .
But what can be done concretely at EU level ?
First of all to the Minister , Mrs Le@@ h@@ tomäki , would she accept that , as the debate has already underlined , circumstances have completely changed since Finland first devis@@ ed the Northern Dimension ?
Madam President , I want to give my support to resolution 1@@ 325 .
I think that the Member States will watch it very carefully and will ask it first to put its house in order .
Mr President , with the Lisbon Treaty approaching , we expect the October European Council to make progress on one of the priority issues - the European External Action Service .
In the meantime , the decision about a response to the specul@@ ations and the allegations about misuse of assistance funds is primarily a matter for the IMF , the World Bank and the G7 countries , since they are obviously the main suppliers of direct financial assistance .
The EU cannot allow the global fight against terrorism be turned into a ground of political horse @-@ trading trading and therefore must respect the aforementioned judgements of courts .
I will of course be addressing the new Parliament on the other side of the June European Council , but I assure you that there will be some mechanism whereby we can continue to keep abreast of all the issues in the intervening period .
The dialogue between you , in the European Parliament , and the Commission does not stop today : we will continue working together in the positive spirit that has characterised this whole exercise and procedure and our shared ambition expressed in the work programme .
The main reason is that men and women tend to be employed in different occupations and men &amp; apos ; s jobs tend to be higher paid .
Mr President , may I begin by paying tribute to the painsta@@ king and , from what I hear , the pa@@ ins @-@ accepting accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report .
Firstly , the right to equality and protection against discrimination .
I also wish to acknowledge and sincerely thank Members of this House for their support for the peace process .
On 17 January 2008 , the European Parliament adopted a resolution ( P@@ 6 _ TA ( 2008 ) 0021 ) that urged China &amp; apos ; not to use the 2008 Olympic Games as a pretext to arrest ... and im@@ prison dissidents , journalists , and human rights activists who either report on , or demonstrate against , human rights abuses &amp; apos ; .
We should also build on what has been achieved in the Cartagena process in which 25 countries - developing and developed countries alike - really want to move forward .
Str@@ eng@@ thening dialogue on sector policy to encourage implementation of responsible fisheries : that is also very much needed .
With good work and good cooperation , we can tackle these gh@@ o@@ sts of the past .
That is why I am saying that we also have to look out for new instruments and ways to do more .
China has a lamentable history of executing more people than anywhere else in the world , including for so @-@ called called &amp; apos ; economic crimes &amp; apos ; .
The need to develop consensus statements on best practice is important and it is vital to engage the candidate countries who are often so far behind in this area .
in writing . - The most important topic in the discussion about the future of the Europe 2020 strategy is the challenge of need and sustainability .
Furthermore , it may also help if mutual trust has already been established between the various groups .
The Commission has been engaged in this process from the start .
I think that those elements , which have been reinforced in the new proposal , are extremely welcome as regards sustaining competition between independent repa@@ i@@ rers and market access for spare parts with equivalent quality mar@@ k@@ ings : the opening up of that market is very welcome .
Al@@ ready Italy , France , Belgium , Luxembourg , Spain , Germany , Austria and Finland have notably and hon@@ our@@ ably ratified the Treaty .
It is essential that country action be supported by regional and global action , sharing knowledge and best practice , sharing training resources and changing international recruitment policies to make them more ethical .
Let me just say a few words about the European Council itself .
I do not think there was .
The President said that he would reply in writing .
Since then - and I par@@ ap@@ h@@ rase the wording of the Commission - we all have made every effort to meet the European Council objectives to bring the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania to a successful conclusion in 2004 , on the basis of its own merits , with a view to signing the Accession Treaty as early as possible in 2005 , and we all expect Bulgaria and Romania to fulfil the economic and criteria and to be ready for membership on 1 January 2007 .
In the past twenty @-@ five five years , and apart from temporary cyclical fluctuations , the EU has not kept pace with the US in improving its standard of living .
The presidency conclusions begin by stating that the Convention was successful in bringing our Union closer to its citizens , strengthening our Union &amp; apos ; s democratic character , enhancing our Union &amp; apos ; s ability to act as a coherent and unified force in the international system .
Over the years , critical voices have been raised , saying that the Ombudsman is not sufficiently known , and that the results for citizens are inadequate because the institutions neither cooperate nor respect their obligation of good administration .
I think of all the b@@ its of paper we produce in this Parliament .
Mr K@@ as@@ ou@@ li@@ des , I agree with you we are at a crossroads : we must make the right decisions ; we must help the Palestinian people , but at the same time we must stick with our principles .
This is a unique chance to address a unique phenomenon .
U@@ p until now , only one side has shown some readiness to implement both the European Parliament resolution and the 12 proposals you mentioned before , Commissioner .
That is the real situation .
But I am afraid some of the amendments to which the Commission has already made reference take away from the spirit of our initial intentions and the initial way in which we reacted .
When the Working Time Directive is revised , we shall be on the side of freedom and choice ; when the Temporary Workers Directive is reviewed , we shall , again , be on the side of freedom and choice .
Sor@@ ry to say , I think this is a poor and unnecessary piece of legislation , and I will vote against in the hope that I can save farmers , hor@@ ti@@ cultur@@ alists and local authorities from a bureaucratic nightmare .
In thanking Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour and everybody else - many MEPs from all sides of this House were involved in achieving the broad consensus that we reached and an enormous amount of hard work was done and great tribute has been paid to the MEPs here - I would also like to note that various Commission officials worked extremely hard to effect the changes and to get from the text Parliament produced at its first reading to the text that went to the Council .
Again let me remind Parliament of the strong emphasis placed on the need for coherence .
Mr President , I would like to begin by complimenting Mrs Paliadeli on her excellent report .
in writing . - This proposal is a follow @-@ up up to the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles ( L@@ C@@ V@@ s ) , as follows :
In conclusion , I can assure you that these issues can and will be urgently and seriously addressed .
The Commission must also demonstrate to us that cooperation between service providers and copyright holders will not impinge on citizens &amp; apos ; fundamental rights , especially the right to privacy , the right to freedom of expression and the right to due process .
There is a clear consensus in Lib@@ yan society : there should be no direct military intervention in Libya .
The turmoil was triggered by the economic and banking crisis in Argentina , which led to spil@@ lo@@ ver effects on other Mercosur countries such as U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay and Brazil .
Madam President , a regime which w@@ ant@@ only allows its own citizens to needlessly suffer in pursuit of its own xenophobic par@@ ano@@ ia is not just am@@ oral but evil , and sadly such a junta rules in Burma .
Our process of enlargement , as everyone has been pointing out , is performance @-@ based based . It requires reforms .
Looking at the example of America , where they have given aid to some of the most inefficient producers , producers who have not taken account of the times , let us make sure that we do not repeat those mistakes and give state aid or any aid to companies that have no long @-@ term term viable future .
Political parties are banned , as in Belgium , or their ban is sought on invented evidence , as in Germany , or a back@@ door ban is sought , as in the United Kingdom , where my own party has been banned , by a court order sought by the government , from accepting new members for an indefin@@ ite period .
These are going to be difficult discussions and internal institutional reform is needed in the EU if the enlargement process is to be successful .
What we want from the Commission , given that the UK Government has now applied for solidarity funding , is a rapid response to that application , but at the same time we need all the EU institutions to make climate change a top priority .
For its part , the Commission is deeply committed to improving the situation of Roma people and , in particular , their social and economic integration .
The way in which the whole Commission proposal is written is very patch@@ y and it is very timid .
I am keen to encourage both of those aspects , but overall this report is extremely worthwhile .
Mr President , as the Socialist shadow rapporteur on &amp; apos ; Everything but Arms &amp; apos ; I welcome this agreement as a significant step in advancing fairer trade access to bring development to the world &amp; apos ; s poorest countries .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , I believe it is mad@@ ness for this European Parliament to approve the 2009 EU budget when financial irregularities or possible fraud affect between 2 % and more than 5 % of the total .
Your response , Commissioner , is urgently awaited .
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House .
This process lacks scientific rigour and integrity .
I believe this to be contempt for Parliament and I intend to make a formal complaint , but I also believe we need to review how we deal with this .
Ensuring economic and employment growth will certainly help to increase social cohesion , but investing in social inclusion and human capacity is an essential complementary element in supporting sustainable employment and economic progress .
That is why neighbours worry and I understand the Austrian position in this .
The Commission must also be aware that countries that have oppressive tax regimes , which are re@@ tar@@ ding economic growth and creating unemployment , are sometimes the authors of their own mis@@ fortune and it is their national policies that drive some industries to loc@@ ate elsewhere .
on behalf of the S &amp; amp ; D Group . - Mr President , Ukraine is a very important country to us .
There needs to be provision for helping people into employment and this should be reflected in the guidelines under point 3.@@ 3 .
As I said , I tried to achieve a consensus with the compromise amendments that we came forward with in committee .
I hope that the Commission will be able to reassure the Committee on Fisheries that its appe@@ arance is imminent .
It will also create more problem @-@ free free driving , and we hope that will happen Europe @-@ wide wide .
I would like to ensure that there is a dispute settlement mechanism in the Agreement .
I want this noted for the record .
The resolution also recognises the importance of the paci@@ fication process in the region , a process led and implemented by African countries and organisations .
The reason why I would suggest that we postpone the vote is because - as Mr Goebbels has said - it is a very important issue .
On parliamentary questions : we are not proposing any limit to parliamentary questions , we are simply saying that the same guidelines that we as a Parliament have already adopted for Question Time questions should apply to written questions , namely that they should be within the remit of the European Union and of the institution called upon to answer them .
Sometimes , of course , one could invite MEPs , but I understand that on this issue there is a good cooperation between the European Parliament , Commission and Council and I hope that can continue .
This will have to be done with full respect for the ratification process that is now going on .
Concerning prison conditions : the Member States are under a general obligation to ensure that prison conditions are in accordance with the basic tenets of human dignity and do not violate the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment laid down in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
In particular , the reasons for the listing had not been communicated in advance of the decision .
As a matter of fact , if our aim is to bring further productivity , innovation capacity and sustainable growth for the Union , the emphasis should be put on the role of SMEs .
I wanted to thank her for being willing to give her personal attention to these matters .
The report relates to inland water@@ way vessels , but I believe that this mode of transportation cannot be dis@@ associated from the larger picture of transport by sea .
We endorse the motion &amp; apos ; s recognition of the freeing of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe from the yoke of Commun@@ ism and their fight for liberty .
However , the Commission believes it is essential to ensure the continuity of network and information security activities .
Most of all , I welcome the fact that we now have collective responsibility to protect civilians against genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and all crimes against humanity .
We not only maintained close bilateral contacts with both parties throughout the dispute but also urged them to resolve this dispute .
I would certainly welcome the adoption of appropriate arrangements among the European institutions to reinforce our coordination and to better define our roles and responsibilities , including the establishment of a Parliament election coordination group .
First , there is the issue of enlargement .
It is important that if you have legislation and rules , they must be enforced .
In my own contacts with Syria , as in meetings with others , we have welcomed Syria &amp; quot ; s stated intention and readiness to respect Resolution 17@@ 01 and lend support to its implementation and , moreover , also to be constructive in a comprehensive Middle East peace process .
in writing . - This amendment appears to limit the immunity from prosecution of Europol officials but it only does so for those operating as part of Joint Investig@@ ation Teams .
I think a great deal has already been done , because public awareness of this issue is growing .
While I still b@@ aul@@ k at compulsory quotas for women &amp; apos ; s participation , albeit in politics or business , my faith in a mer@@ it@@ ocr@@ acy is being so@@ rely tested the older and , hopefully , the wis@@ er I get .
This report provides valuable input in the implementation stage and in the follow @-@ up up to the summit , as does the communication on rural development presented by my colleague , Mr Nielson .
Trade access is the key to development for our ACP partners , just as it is the aci@@ d test for Europe &amp; apos ; s genuine commitment to put development first .
It should also push the President to move on his offer for the Red Cross to monitor the prisons , stress that the European Union will continue to monitor the situation closely and , if warranted , take up the President &amp; quot ; s offer for the EU Representatives to return to the country for further dialogue .
What of Third World countries which meet debt obligations , of which there are many ? 4 .
We should be prepared to recognise when China is moving in the right direction , for example , the transition to Chinese rule in Hong Kong has gone far better than most people ever expected and we should recognise that .
In those cases where the Council may wish to take a particularly rapid decision , the Commission will duly inform the Parliament of this possibility .
in writing . - Mr President , Vice @-@ President President of the Commission , the murder of David K@@ ato K@@ is@@ u@@ le was a tremendous tragedy for his family and friends as well as a great loss for the L@@ GB@@ T and human rights movement in sub @-@ Saharan Saharan Africa .
However , I object to the creation of European Union bodies that would exercise power over Member States in areas that are wider than necessary to deal with this problem .
Unfortunately humanitarian aid work in some areas of Chechnya strongly affected by the hostilities is still not possible , as lack of security makes these areas in@@ accessible .
We simply do not know because we have not had the risk assessments .
Aid for trade is necessary to create the conditions and infrastructure to trigger growth , but this aid must be under the control of the recipients themselves to fit within their own national development plans .
It is only then that we can build the kind of Europe that I would like to see .
Mr President , following the ongoing debate on transparency and openness in the Council and the exchange of views between the United Kingdom Presidency and Members of the European Parliament on this issue , a first discussion took place in COREPER , the Permanent Representatives &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; committee , on 19 October .
Mr President , like my colleagues , I , too , have been concerned by some of the trends outlined in the internal document which , in the grand old scheme of things , was leaked recently .
However , if we are not able to have this debate this morning , if there are too many speakers down for the Napolitano report and the Gi@@ anna@@ kou report , then I would support Mr Pirker &amp; apos ; s proposal that we not vote on the matter tomorrow .
I would like to assure the Members of the House that the refugees are fully aware of , and greatly value and appreciate , the earlier efforts of the European Parliament in drawing attention to their situation .
We all want to see our talks come to a successful conclusion which - in accordance with the Security Council resolutions - would mean the sanctions would go .
Nevertheless , the counterfeiting of euros remains a serious and especially a symbolic problem , even if its proportions are not alarming .
I assume , therefore , that you will allow us to do that .
In these circumstances , full implementation of the R@@ ail Package would result in a considerable burden on the administrations of these Member States without any of the benefits to consumers that the Package is designed to bring about .
Mr President , it is a very important matter that we discuss tonight , as Mr Bolkestein said .
I shall again leave it to the discretion of the Minister as to whether he wishes to deal with this .
The Commission can accept the following amendments : Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 and 16 .
Mr President , I just wanted to ask whether we were going to benefit from the presence of the presidency of the Council this afternoon , because the remarks that I want to make - and which I am sure many of my colleagues will be making - are in fact directed at the Council .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support for the two @-@ step step approach we have taken for amending the Directive .
In this context , the Commission &amp; apos ; s role is to minimise distortion of competition between all types of media .
We need to really focus on the core elements of what kind of a vision the US and the European Union can give to the world in the 21st century .
I have come to the view , having thought about it long and hard , that food security is a very important aspect of our global population growth . The European Union should be secure in its own food security .
I am reminded that the Social Charter was brought in 14 years ago when I was President of the Social Affairs Council .
It is imperative that we try to make the European Union the most energy @-@ efficient efficient economy in the world by 2020 .
Finally , especially today , my sympathy goes to the Nigerian people on the death of their President .
In continuing to raise these issues we reflect the concerns of many in the business community in Europe .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , this has indeed been an interesting debate showing how many important subjects are covered by Arctic cooperation , and how varied are the sensitivities in our society when discussing the Arctic &amp; apos ; s future .
As well as bringing MEPs to the informal Competitiveness Council , which engaged directly in discussions with ministers , the Presidency organised a series of meetings with the social partners .
I would also like to thank the Ombudsman himself , because I have had the opportunity to follow his work , and am aware of the level of correctness , seriousness and commitment with which he carries out his tasks .
I would like to stress once again the need to better coordinate actions of the EU Member States in the UN and , in particular , in the UN Human Rights Council .
At the session on Monday , the General Affairs and External Relations Council welcomed the work of the Special En@@ voy , Mr Fas@@ sino , in coordinating the diplomatic efforts of the European Union and its Asian partners and reaffirmed his role in supporting and promoting the United Nations mission .
A good sli@@ ce of the economy of a third world country is destroyed , all because EU fleets , due to their reck@@ less rape of their own seas , now move on to other targets .
In short , I am very much in favour of the proposal , but I think that the stronger we build it the better it will be for BONUS and for the region .
On the one hand , it is extremely technical , and probably any common citizen would find it difficult to understand .
The existing provision in this area may need to be strengthened .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I think it is very clear that we all want to address the question of human rights whenever and wherever possible .
Bro@@ adly speaking , I am not against cloning in terms of scientific research and animal breeding development .
It is now the case that , when the people of Ireland said &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; to what we are now calling the Treaty of Lisbon , we have the g@@ all the carry out an investigation into the reason why the people of Ireland voted incorrectly .
There has been a significant reduction in employment in the sector over the past years .
I was even trying to or@@ ch@@ estr@@ ate some kind of a joint effort with my colleague from Sweden , because 2009 is the year of the Czech and the Swedish presidencies and we have pretty similar views .
Let us make sure the EU does not commit the same mistake twice .
Madam President , I would like to congratulate all those involved in this report and this very significant achievement : the rapporteur Gay Mitchell , all the political groups - including my own - and Commissioner Michel .
That is why I ask for your support and the adoption of this amendment .
The report produced by the Commission on 12 May 1999 , which it was pursuant to Article 8 of the Council enabling regulation , was the first step in the process leading to the adoption of a new regulation .
I assume that is what the Conference of Presidents intended when they put this on the agenda .
The current international financial liquidity crisis and the economic backdrop has allowed many to grow cautious of setting long @-@ term term CO2 targets or of committing industry to achieving the necessary greenhouse gas reductions and thus driving Europe &amp; apos ; s economy forward towards the low @-@ carbon carbon , sustainable economy which we so desperately need and which , I agree , will spar@@ k a third industrial revolution with exciting first @-@ mover mover advantage for Europe in the whole area of new technologies .
Mr President , this oral question is a consequence of the debates in the Committee on Legal Affairs on the immunity of Mr Tom@@ c@@ zak .
Thirdly , because of different approaches from different Member States , we would like to look at whether it is feasible to have an EU framework for non @-@ bank bank micro@@ finance institutions .
How would you answer the charge that the EU is running an agenda in the Western Balkans which is to the benefit of the Serbs in Belgrade and Bag@@ na Lu@@ ca - with the Bos@@ ni@@ ac@@ s the losers ?
We need to demand that Hamas does not touch the human rights of Palestinians .
Discrimination on the basis of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation has no place in European society .
Thus , today we are not just confronting you but those nomin@@ ating you as the only candidate for one of the most important European positions .
The Commission does , however , share the view that the principle is important as a background for the revision of the directive , and a reference to this principle could therefore be made in the first recital of the directive .
I remember last year , when I took up office , people told me that negotiations on the directive were at a dead end .
They want a Europe that is based on human values , based firmly on universal rights .
National parliaments could be better involved with early information , and some aspects of the External Action Service may , for instance , be explored in due course .
Many of the issues we are discussing go to the heart of the debate about national sovereignty , which some appear to think has been solved by the proposal to create a full @-@ time time President of the Council .
The framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings , the directive on carriers &amp; apos ; liability and the directive and the framework decision on the liability of smugglers , already approved by the Council , are only first steps .
Mr President , our task and responsibility here is to ensure that both Member States and the Union as a whole emerge stronger from the crisis , and the economic governance package takes us in this direction .
We now have the opportunity to reass@@ ess the existing framework to get rid of bottlenecks and to map out a more competitive future for this crucial industry .
We must deliver effective action at a global level , but we must also dru@@ m up wide support for our proposed action among countries and civil society .
One of our most important amendments would make the implementation of Free Trade A@@ reas ( F@@ T@@ As ) conditional on a prior in @-@ depth depth sustainability impact assessment , to ensure that the FTA does not exacerbate inequalities among partners , and to establish mandatory rules to promote social justice and sustainability .
As we have heard , we have the motiv@@ eless murder of an innocent man .
However , we understand now that the reason the Commission wished to make the statement on Friday was because on Thursday there is a meeting of the Veterinary Committee which will look at this matter , and so the Commission will therefore be in a position to give further information on Friday .
As far as Mr MacCormick is concerned , I am glad to see Mr Corbett sitting here because it is the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that is now looking at this matter , after the Bureau decided to refer it to them .
Regional integration is the backbone of the European Union .
We also support the oral amendment tabled today .
I would put to the honourable Members here today that if the same criteria had been applied , the histories of some of the current Member States would have dis@@ bar@@ red them from membership of the European Union .
That was a very important issue too .
The report also proposes the development of tools to strengthen partnership and new governance .
For this coordination work , we do have the European platform for Roma inclusion , which is a unique mechanism for involving the stakeholders .
The Commission has proposed a horizontal directive for several different reasons .
If Denmark and the United Kingdom decide to apply for membership of the euro area , they will be subject to the same convergence assessment as any other candidate , as happened with other Member States that have already joined the euro area .
I am pleased to see that you are following on from the Portuguese Presidency - and indeed into the French Presidency - with your emphasis on volunteering , and in particular on youth volunteering .
We must make sure they are effective .
The plans will help Scotland &amp; apos ; s airports in competing with its British counterparts , especially by reducing the dominant position occupied by major travel hu@@ bs like London .
This has been communicated to Parliament but of course because Parliament rose at roughly the time we were producing that document , there was not an opportunity to formally bring it before Parliament at that juncture .
It is a response to the Commission &amp; apos ; s communication on recent changes to the International Atomic Energy Agency &amp; apos ; s transport regulations .
Firstly , we are unconvinced by the benefits of agreements which are of huge cost to the European taxpayer and yet seem to supply limited benefits to EU fishermen as a whole .
We are also closely monitoring preparations for the November 2005 parliamentary elections and urging the Azerbai@@ j@@ ani authorities to ensure that they are conducted in full compliance with OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections .
In this spirit , we welcome the Commission proposals and look forward to a speedy confirmation of the protocol to enable such cooperation to start at Community level , in addition to existing bilateral initiatives by individual Member States .
I fully support the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s idea of creating a specialised unit in the office to be established in Malta .
There can be no argument for paramili@@ tary justice for any sector of the community and my Group believes there never has been .
In conclusion , I should like to say that since I took up office as Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection , I have made it clear that the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority was a top priority .
This is important to disability groups in Member States who fought hard for recognition of their existing cards , and also to local authorities and other bodies that might in@@ cur costs in the first case if this had to be altered too quickly .
We will try to agree the terms of reference of our work this evening before our summit with President Putin tomorrow .
I particularly agree with the point that we need to adapt the CAP to meet food security concerns and the fact that farmers need a stable policy environment in order to plan for the future .
In this report there are calls for Member States to coordinate their policies better , as well as calls for the Commission to develop a new ICT policy .
Looking at what we can do here in the EU from a policy perspective , I would urge the Council to review and update the guidelines on the death penalty , which date back to 1998 , so that new elements and strategies that have developed since then can be taken into consideration .
The UK , like other Member States , has played its part in resett@@ ling refugees through national resettlement programmes in the past , but it is hugely important that through a coordinated , cooperative and communic@@ ative approach we discuss how we can best reconcile assisting those most in need with the situations of those Member States that are already over@@ burdened with national priorities .
I think that that would be , from my perspective , something worthwhile .
These fair trial provisions are defined by all of Europe and are the rights of every European citizen .
Lastly , I have heard some criticism to the effect that the Commission has granted the United States mutual recognition of its wine @-@ making making practices .
But this requires more and not less Europe .
In the ES@@ S report , it is rightly said that the links between internal and external EU policies have become more pron@@ ounced , which is clearly essential when we are considering issues such as energy security and climate change , or the focus on the security and development nex@@ us and recognition of the importance of long @-@ term term poverty reduction as a means to reducing security threats .
Without that definition of affordability it really does deprive consumers of a sound legal base with which to defend their interests .
I am of course referring to Turkey , which , despite much pressure put upon it by the EU , continues not to implement or ratify the Ankara Protocol with respect to Cyprus , thus effectively imposing an embargo on all shipping and air transport with Cyprus .
A sp@@ in @-@ off off from these directives has been the development of support systems in most Member States and a continuation of the leading role of the EU in eco @-@ technology technology .
This whole programme can be made more acceptable if this happens .
I am sure it would be good for jobs , good for growth , good for equal access for all .
But throughout the European Union now , we have unprecedented levels of material wealth , unprecedented at any period during the history of Europe , and yet there are a large number of people who do not share in the progress which has been achieved .
Food security was already a priority of the first EU @-@ Africa Africa action plan , within the partnership on the MDGs , and we will propose to maintain this as a priority area for the next action plan that is currently being drafted .
The current lack of legal certainty , whereby various legal instruments apply to different categories of products , while loopholes exist in other areas , is an obstacle to market safety and to the proper functioning of the single market .
Mr Wa@@ igel recently mentioned one cannot at the same time be &amp; apos ; in &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; out &amp; apos ; , outside the euro zone and inside the X @-@ Council Council .
The Commission and Parliament monitor sub@@ missions made by each Member State of the Union to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact .
So rather than repeat what has been said by other speakers , I just want to mention to the Dutch presidency two points on which I would like to see some action .
When we deal with China , we of course take into consideration the geopolitical aspects and the important role China plays in the world .
It is about building something uniquely European - not the same as what happens in Member States , whether it is Germany , Italy , France , the UK or wherever .
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the Member States &amp; apos ; annual national plans for employment .
Mr President , in the last Parliament , much attention was paid to the Members &amp; apos ; and assistants &amp; apos ; statutes , and I think that was quite appropriate .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , Member States and the European Union have at their disposal other means to deal with human @-@ rights rights @-@ related related issues .
Mr Ar@@ gy@@ ros and I have submitted a joint compromise text which I very much hope will meet with the support of this House .
We hope that after free and fair elections we can offer them an enhanced agreement , perhaps a free trade agreement .
The Commission firmly supports closer cooperation at global level , with employment and social objectives going hand in hand with economic objectives .
The Commission would be prepared to accept some of the amendments to increase further the level of public availability of information , but I do not consider it appropriate or reasonable to try to amend general comitology rules through this instrument .
The Conservatives , I am sorry to say , are now wishing to introduce a new doctrine that political parties have power over individuals .
It comes as some concern to me that there is a risk if Parliament ad@@ he@@ res to the view that it appears to have on this issue , that we are going to have a situation whereby comitology will not be accepted in this way but rather there will be an adherence to codecision .
The present instability and violence cannot and must not continue indefinitely .
And , building on the experience of EU @-@ US US cooperation in the Balkans , we are already working together on the reconstruction of Afghanistan .
The Council will look at global energy security , energy markets and product regulation , at new technologies and research .
I am happy that we managed to reach a compromise on all the major issues , such as the deadline for the presentation of a new proposal for a decision , which is now 30 April 2010 , as well as on the sunset clause , which is 18 months after the deadline , 31 October 2011 .
This , unfortunately , will not happen overnight , but has to be worked on .
Mr President , Commissioners , first of all I want to thank the rapporteur for his report .
The strictest possible criteria to reduce noise and emissions from aircraft engines can only be achieved however by using performance criteria and not design criteria which is commercially sponsored and fast @-@ track track in anti @-@ competitive competitive legislation .
As you will remember , we went through our own debates on this in Britain .
It is time now for governments to listen to what this Parliament has to say 100 % of the time and for those governments to act .
Again , our experience is that these systems are far from adequate .
What support can be given to the various countries to ensure that a ban is properly implemented ?
If we want the next generation to be enthusiastic European as well as national citizens we must be prepared to put our money where our mouth is and invest in high @-@ quality quality education .
The proposals of the Irish presidency under the title &amp; apos ; Out@@ line for a draft revision of the Treaties &amp; apos ; are the dis@@ till@@ ation of views and opinions gathered from a myriad of discussions , debate and seminars at political and official level with academics , NGOs and social partners , a process that began under the Italian presidency and gathered momentum during the last six months .
in writing . - I voted for the resolution , which welcomes the World Bank &amp; apos ; s energy strategy and recalls that it should specifically address how access to energy can help lift people out of poverty , while facilitating the shift to an environmentally sustainable energy development path ; urges the World Bank to pursue an approach to private @-@ sector sector development that delivers maximum benefit to the poor while tackling climate change ; and underlines that environmental and social factors , at both national and local community levels , must be taken into account in a comprehensive cost @-@ benefit benefit analysis of energy options .
Yet there are new challenges to health associated with the accelerated globalisation of the markets , such as SA@@ RS and avian flu .
It is aston@@ ishing to note that migration , which is one of the greatest challenges the world has to face , is one area where organisation is lacking on an international level .
The Council also requested that as soon as possible , and by May 2009 at the latest , a report containing an in @-@ depth depth assessment and comparison of both scenarios should be submitted to the Council by the Presidency and the Commission .
The Commission can accept all the amendments voted by the Development Committee , as they strengthen and clarify the text of the regulation without altering the main objectives .
The Commission is to be congratulated on its response in providing detailed annexes and basic definitions missing from the original .
We feel there is room for improvement , for example on witness protection , and we would like to see improvement there as well .
I do so , as I have argued strongly in committee , on the grounds of subsidiarity , in the belief that decisions should be taken at the lowest practical level .
That will build genuine national consensus around the development plan and promote the stability necessary for its implementation .
To conclude , I should like once again to congratulate and thank Mrs Jackson for her excellent work .
In the last few days I think the Irish voters showed us that far from all Europeans are fully signed up or are clear about the role and benefits of the European Union , about European cooperation and why Europe @-@ wide wide regulations are necessary in the first place .
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament , accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group , I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience .
In these circumstances it is encouraging to be told that the Commission takes this matter seriously , but it is not encouraging to be told that all will be well by June , because the information we are receiving from the commercial parties involved is that they cannot last until June at present levels .
As for spreading European culture , well make the most of it , because the way this c@@ raz@@ y EU is going , there will be none left , just a meaningless man@@ tra : &amp; apos ; United in Diversity &amp; apos ; .
Turkey is welcome to join our Union and I very much hope that it does , but it must accept and abide by our European principles and values .
We now have a legally binding charter which is part of the EU &amp; apos ; s primary legislation .
Mr President , money spent at European level should , generally speaking , be adding value and that should be clear to citizens .
It is not for Europe to med@@ dle in the internal affairs of any nation .
This is a further element in what is a most crucial package of legislation that is now being considered by Parliament to create a single regulatory framework for electronic communications .
EQUAL stands for &amp; quot ; equality &amp; quot ; .
Mr President , on behalf of my Group , I should like to give a very warm welcome to this report and to thank Mrs Flesch for her very comprehensive and detailed work , which shows her experience in the field .
It is fair to point out that the most recent report by the Court of Auditors for the year 1998 has not drawn attention to any single major failure of the Commission in this entire area .
I believe that , as a Petitions Committee and as a Union , we owe petitioners at least the implementation of decisions that have been made against governments and local authorities .
The report af@@ firms our belief in the importance of high @-@ quality quality services of general interest that are accessible to all .
The reality on the ground is the bottlen@@ eck and we should never forget this in this discussion .
I share your concerns about the poor income of our fishermen , especially of the owners of small vessels in coastal regions .
We will all have a very crucial year , because on the 7 June the citizens of Europe will vote in elections .
I would welcome a response from it with regard to the points highlighted in it .
Allow me to try to cool matters down a little bit .
This legitimate interest should not interfere with the work that has already been carried out by the Indian and Norwegian governments whose representatives have been engaged for some time now in the difficult and sensitive task of bro@@ kering negotiations .
I know that the idea Mr Brown mooted was not well received here - or indeed in the Commission - not least by members of his own party .
As I said in my first reply , it is not acceptable that cross @-@ border border payments are so much more expensive than payments made within the borders of any one country , so the concerns of the honourable Member are shared by the Commission .
We should include them in our debate and when considering financial and other forms of aid .
And , if I can quote fisheries as one example , the fact that you have ultraperi@@ ph@@ eral regions in the Indian Ocean , for example , like La R@@ é@@ union , is an example whereby we have a direct voice in the regional fisheries organisations that already exist and the ones that we are trying to promote for that sea .
Given that Prime Minister R@@ ai@@ la O@@ d@@ ing@@ a and the ODM , his party , are vigorously opposed to this legislation , it is also vital for the stability of the Government that it does not become even more of an inflammatory and divisive political issue .
If we have a sudden increase in the number of fac@@ tories , and a sudden surge in imports from Papua New Guinea , then , of course , we will have to revisit the situation and potentially take action .
And finally , I expect at this stage some formula has been arrived at for the ap@@ por@@ tion@@ ment of tax that is pay@@ able in the different Member States .
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
We were more than satisfied when the Romanian Government , even before its membership of the European Union , showed its readiness to accept this directive .
A fundamental prerequisite for successful implementation is the greater involvement of the fishing industry in the entire process from decision @-@ making making to implementation .
In the EU we are committed to the Lisbon Agenda , more and better jobs .
In the report by Mrs Fourtou , whom I congratulate , the Committee on Petitions is for the first time bringing a specific petition to the floor of the European Parliament .
I urge that a tougher regime of pollution control is needed , the goal for the longer term , already contained in international conventions such as OS@@ P@@ AR , H@@ EL@@ COM and Barcelona , to which the EU and Member States are signatory , is the eventual phasing out of toxic substances .
What we , as a democratic body , should be seeking from Venezuela is compliance with international standards of democracy , allowing Venezuelan citizens to take advantage of the fundamentals , the freedom to freely and openly criticise those in power and the ability to change the government via election without fear .
There is a whole range of provisions in this proposal - no less than 81 provisions on Member States - to deal with these sorts of barriers , because businesses want to be able to go into markets ; they want to be able to start up without unnecessary and bureaucratic barriers ; they want to be able to send their experts to other countries .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , we take note of the vote here today .
I am particularly interested in the idea that we need to promote outside our borders , and I would agree wholeheartedly with that , but we also have to be realistic about how we are going to compete , and whether we are competitive on a global market .
We know this from our information sources , from the reports and statements issued by international treaty bodies , as well as from my own discussions with bodies such as the European Trade Union Confederation .
Could the Commission justify why Galileo will only be used for civilian purposes , as it seems absurd that the EU decides to build its own satellite navigation system , yet denies its military capacity ?
I also thank the Commission for having agreed to follow the Ombudsman &amp; apos ; s recommendation to allow the candidates access to their marked tests in future competi@@ tions .
It was also the subject of a debate in this Parliament , so I can assure you that we will continue to raise this issue with the US Government as well .
Similarly , we are also not in favour of extending the scope of the export ban .
That is why the Commission negotiated this agreement .
The only thing I would say to the assistants is that it may be worthwhile exposing certain Members who are not paying their assistants the proper wages which they should be entitled to receive .
Can we take the moral high ground , when the European Union , in the interests of profit - and profit alone - is selling weapons and instruments around the world with which to inflict punishment and death on people We have to look to ourselves first and see what we are doing to fuel human rights abuses in the world .
I can assure you that , globally , what Europe has done in this respect is seen as the right thing to do and we are applauded by people in developing countries and by our development partners for taking this approach to food assistance .
I therefore propose that this vote be postponed under Rule 1@@ 77 ( 4 ) .
The Commission is happy to agree with all these amendments . They reflect well the fruitful discussions between the rapporteur , the Council working group and the Commission services .
Those countries struggling to reform anti@@ qu@@ ated economies , and to build modern societies based on respect for human rights and the rule of law , have , at the same time , to deal with the legacy of war .
I welcome too Commissioner Patten &amp; apos ; s honourable personal commitment and record of success in this regard .
I look forward to the proposals for a &amp; apos ; common legislation &amp; apos ; by the end of the year .
I believe that is a fair compromise between the Commission and Parliament and therefore support the proposal that Parliament give its assent to the draft Council decision .
Likewise I welcome the suggestion that the Commission should engage with developing countries to give them assistance in dealing with IUU fishing .
I would just like to say that Irish farmers support the European Union , but over the weekend I had many come to my door who are questioning their decisions in relation to voting on various treaties .
The first responsibility of the present Commission is , therefore , to connect with citizens .
In relation to Sup@@ plem@@ entary and Amending Budget Nu@@ mber 3 of this year , I would like to refer to an amendment which I tabled on behalf of my group , UEN , at the Budget Committee but which unfortunately was not accepted .
I also thank , in particular , Mrs Caroline Jackson , chairperson of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , and Mr Jo@@ seph Daul , chairperson of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , for their valuable input .
However , the alternative wor@@ dings proposed in Amendments 12 and 13 are not clear and would render the implementation of the directive difficult .
We would like to have a dialogue with you over the next couple of weeks to ensure that the broad economic guidelines for the future are what we actually require in this new European environment .
Mr President , it is a great honour to address you today on the Middle East peace process .
I should like to ask the Commissioner one question .
The EU is a critical part of the global solidarity effort for Haiti .
Mr President , I am anxious to contribute to this debate to emphasise two main points .
Why should European citizens have a different level of protection from US citizens ?
I want to just also say something about labels .
I hope that , at the Council meeting tomorrow , the leaders , the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council and the President of the Commission will deal with that issue most urgently .
That is a very fundamental question that must be made perfectly clear in any law that we pass .
Mr President , the European Union &amp; apos ; s foreign policy has been a pione@@ er of a positive conditionality model - the &amp; apos ; method of the carrot &amp; apos ; -@@ implementing it successfully in relations with its candidate countries .
You mentioned that there have been contractual penalties imposed owing to the delays in the visa information system .
This new era is one that belongs to the innovative , those with relevant knowledge and those who are able to recognise changing world climates and adapt accordingly .
Could the Commission explain what has changed and why it does not see any il@@ legality at the moment , whereas a year ago it seemed that the Irish Government was in breach of the common fisheries policy regulations by allowing this vessel to fish in Community waters ?
They are attacks under the clo@@ ak of night , human bombs in cro@@ w@@ ded streets and on buses ; there are always victims of terrorism , as there are victims of crime , victims of man @-@ in@@ duc@@ ed in@@ duc@@ ed f@@ amin@@ e .
We will continue to take the most serious account of human rights violations .
In conclusion , I would like to say something about the five amendments which have been proposed by Mr Goebbels .
This has been a joint and collabor@@ ative exercise and I am extraordinarily grateful to all of you for the work that has gone on .
No , it is obvious for us in@@ siders that it means equivalence with the Council .
Mr President , I want to thank Mr G@@ ir@@ ão Pe@@ reira for his report and to say that I support this deal made on behalf of European fishermen .
If there are to be problems - and sometimes there are problems - it will be around this whole question of the proposal to finance the shortfall in Category 4 with money from the agricultural section of the budget .
The issue here is that we have a European Fundamental Rights Agency as if there were no such protection for human rights in the Member States .
We , for our part , will reiterate our determination to press ahead with ratification of the Kyoto Protocol , and our hope that the recon@@ ven@@ ed 6@@ th Conference of the Parties to the climate change convention , scheduled for Bonn , can find a means which allows the United States to stick with the process .
And to carry out citizen education , to educate citizens about human rights .
Depending on the result of that , my point is that I am proposing a separate vote on the original text .
Britain may well be an island , but it is time that Britain re@@ visited the question of joining the euro , because we cannot all go our separate ways .
Finally , I am satisfied there is always a need to clarify the procedures for the transmission of confidential information .
As established in the common position adopted on 11 @-@ 12 12 June 2001 by the European Union , the Commission remains committed to supporting initiatives contributing to a political solution to the An@@ gol@@ an conflict .
We have to think about the adverse effects on other fisheries when protective measures are introduced .
On the one hand , there is aid for developing the infrastructure and human resources of the less prosperous regions .
Kar@@ in J@@ öns is putting forward in this report some very concrete and well @-@ thought thought @-@ out out proposals .
I hope implementation of this directive will be fast @-@ tracked tracked in Britain to make it easier for consumers to play their part in reducing energy consumption and tackling climate change .
People have described the Copenhagen conference as a flo@@ p and a failure .
The report also recognises that , like any other modern industry , farming needs to be competitive , efficient and able to respond and adapt to market demands .
Madam President , the problem of migrants coming in to the EU from across the Mediterranean affects us all .
If the EU has a competence , things happen .
Mr President , I will draw the honourable Member &amp; apos ; s remarks to the attention of my colleague , Mr Fischler , and I know that they will be of interest to him .
I agree that implementation is very important .
This is a tribute to Parliament , but moreover , this is a tribute to the thousands of women who have been fighting for years .
We are doing this because we realise that the private sector - the private entrepreneurs , the fishermen - are not in a position to be able to significantly part @-@ finance finance any restructuring out of their own pockets .
I , like many others tomorrow , will vote for this report and the bulk of the amendments , knowing that by going forward to the second reading we are taking steps in the long process of developing an environment policy for the European Union which will out@@ last all the presidencies and all the ministers that this Parliament will see , and which will probably also out@@ last most of the Members of this House .
The enlargement process is going to face us with a whole series of new problems with regard to implementation and enforcement of legislation .
An opt @-@ out out is not a real opt @-@ out out as the Charter remains binding on the Institutions and on Community law , even if some countries still hope that it is not going to affect domestic law .
She has indeed worked quite hard although , in the case of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I am afraid she was working so hard that she was not able to pay anything more than a goodwill visit to our committee .
In this new enlarged Europe , Scotland must surely aspire to more than that .
The first point is that we should not blame Luxembourg ; quite the contrary : it did an excellent job with the presidency and showed what small countries can do while running presidencies in general .
I would like to clarify that our vote on Recital 6 - Amendments 190 and 226 - should read &amp; apos ; + &amp; apos ; ( in favour ) .
Other amendments above the draft budget are also proposed and some of them could be implemented if there were a legal base .
The rapporteur has been so kind as to thank my cabinet and my services .
I would make a domestic point to my colleagues here , namely that we really address the issue of sustainable development better in this Parliament .
I know , perhaps , you have personal views on it , but there will definitely not be developed , at least from the European Commission .
Mr President , first I would like to welcome the Stockholm Programme as the best way forward to a citizen @-@ centred centred Europe , and to thank both Minister As@@ k and Minister Billström for their vision .
As stocks have been declining over the last years as a consequence of the successive reforms of the common agricultural policy , the Commission introduced a series of changes to secure the continuation of this scheme and these changes include the possibility of market purchase for products that are not available from our intervention stocks , the exchange of products within the same &amp; apos ; family &amp; apos ; and the possibility to mix or incorporate intervention products and products bought on the market .
Here we have a proposal to decrease the funding for the coming year .
But in the European Union , we are doing everything we can to have a binding framework that commits ourselves and all the Member States to the principle of non @-@ discrimination discrimination and to special protection for disabled people .
Mr President , Members of the European Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , I am deeply honoured to be here today .
Although I support the substance of this resolution , I could not support the second part of paragraph 19 which supports a separate seat for the EU in the UN Security Council .
Mr President , I am pleased to support this initiative on behalf of the European Free Alliance / Green Group in Parliament .
We would like the Council to come forward with the right kind of conclusions so it can be included in the 2003 procedure .
Not only will it be exposed as economic lun@@ acy , but it will be profoundly damaging to the European project .
As the Council is not here at the moment , perhaps the Presidency could find out what it intends to do on this subject ?
That will take time , because this is also a question of societal change , but it is very important to be there and offer and agree to that .
They have already been given the perspective of membership of the European Union and we are focusing in this document - as we were asked to do by the Copenhagen European Council - on those countries that do not have the perspective of membership .
Although the European Union has been very active in the nuclear sector , up to now there has been a clear failure of the European Union and G @-@ 7 7 policy .
There are things that make us different , but they need not divide us if we can show tolerance , respect and understanding for them .
It sends a good signal to citizens that the EU will now be able to mobilise funds for the populations of regions struck by disasters .
The Government &amp; apos ; s efforts in this respect are to be commended .
And with this , Europe will lead the way strongly for the rest of the world .
While I welcome it , I urge the incoming French Presidency to give it the priority it needs .
I certainly share the concerns expressed by the honourable Member .
In terms of energy policy , that means sticking to strategic aims on security of supply , sustainability and competitiveness , while considering whether we need to change the tactics , the means .
This is important to note in view also of the very few statements made during the summit that devi@@ ated somewhat from this general consensus about the basic principles that we and others take for granted .
However , there is no doubt - as stated in the Hague programme on mutual recognition adopted by the European Council - that it would in fact be much easier to enforce judgments within the European Union if it were possible to obtain accurate information on deb@@ tors &amp; apos ; financial positions .
The same question can be asked of national parliaments .
However , more needs to be done by Europe not only as regards reporting and closing down sites but also in assisting law enforcement agencies to track and prosecute offenders and to identify the victims .
The aim of having a policy at European Union level is to try to have a consistency across the Union with a view to eventually having a wider consistency outside the European Union which is equally as important .
Finally , the social and human aspects of the partnership show today , more than ever , its relevance , creating bridges across the Mediterranean and promoting a better understanding of each other &amp; apos ; s cultures and societies .
But I have to say that dialogue - especially following recent events in Biarritz and L@@ au@@ san@@ ne - is real and very concrete between the European Commission and its partners , including FIFA .
That is what the House is voting for .
I am of the belief that a whole country and not part of it may be eligible for the status of a region when special circumstances so dictate .
He should therefore tell us what is really going on .
Finally , as winter approaches , Russia cannot be permitted once again to use its virtual monopoly of gas supplies to Europe as a diplomatic weapon .
If this requires us to make changes to legislation or to national rules with regard to the support given to football clubs , then so be it .
I sincerely hope that these measures will be formally adopted by the Council of Fisheries Ministers next week and then swiftly implemented .
When it comes to the compromise package that we will vote on I am prepared to recommend to colleagues that we do not support this area but on condition that the Commission assu@@ res us that it will continue to keep this under very close scrutiny when it comes to looking at the Tele@@ vision without Fronti@@ ers directive and also to encourage the fair access provisions .
The Commission understands the need for coordinated action at EU level to aver@@ t a severe crisis for the industry and to ensure that the problem is really tackled head on .
I tell you now that unless we do the right thing , the judgement will be made in the June election in favour of those extreme parties who are not in favour of the EU or the EU institutions .
In addition , the Commission will be adopting a proposal on eco @-@ labelling labelling within a couple of weeks , which will clearly feed into the process of considering whether to adopt the A@@ ID@@ C@@ P certi@@ fic@@ ate .
An example is the fact that last year the Council adopted no less than eight resolutions criticising Israel for its military actions in the Palestinian territories in Lebanon .
Let me , however , recall three important points .
It is time , in Western Europe , that we accepted the fact that the best defence for children against the scourge of paed@@ ophi@@ lia is to understand that the paed@@ ophi@@ le targets the most vulnerable children .
Both the Commission and Parliament already have long @-@ standing standing good cooperation in this area , which has gained even further momentum in the last months .
the report by Mr Sci@@ cl@@ una , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the ECB annual report for 2008 , and
But we wish we could do more and I hope that this debate will help in that .
On the other hand , some Member States simply do not use this possibility , but this can be changed by looking for a legal framework for these contractual relations , whilst clearly safeguarding fair competition .
Here is R@@ ho@@ des , and let us prove here that we are true Europeans , and not when giving lessons to the Commission and the Council .
We understand that not only have the Lisbon guidelines not been pursued and that progress is slow but also , as Mr Dimas commented , the new Member States have to do what we have to do and they have the same problems .
They have fur@@ n@@ ished their opinions on those occasions , most recently within the last couple of months when they took into account the earlier opinions but also all the relevant up @-@ to to @-@ date date scientific opinion on this particular issue .
One final point - we went to a lot of trouble to get this report put together and there was consensus on its content .
Madam President , I was due to talk about the pressures unlimited EU migration is putting on the UK .
It is a recognition that the world has changed and that we need to re@@ direct efforts towards new priorities in order to achieve sustainable cohesion .
The honourable Member will appreciate that ongoing discussions are taking place aimed at achieving a common position .
What the rapporteur has said in his report is absolutely right on this issue .
I welcome , in particular , your emphasis on the rule of law between countries and urge you actively to insist that this is the case in the Middle East .
Madam President , you are probably reading my thoughts because I did not indicate that I wanted the floor , but I wanted to apologise for taking an extra 20 seconds from this extremely lively , huge democratic debate for such an irrelevant question as mass police brutality and political prisoners in a Member State .
However , given what the Commission has just said - that we have data from 10 Member States and that it is not yet available to us - we really are talking about concerns about which we do not have detailed facts .
Turning to one of the most significant areas of dispute between the European Union and the United States , my colleague Mr Mandelson announced yesterday that the EU and the United States have agreed terms for launching negotiations on subsidies affecting the civil aircraft sector .
First , on the scope , the Commission interpre@@ ts that it follows from Article 2 ( 1a ) that during the transitional period of eight years , Member States are obliged to allow electrical and electronic equipment that was outside the scope of Directive 2002 / 95 / EC , but which would be covered by the new directive , to continue to be made available on their market .
It is the beginning of our term of office and we must do many things , and this is a very good starting point : the Swedish Presidency .
As regards the budge@@ tisation of the funds after the expi@@ ry of the Treaty , the Commission agrees that the resources and the expenditure will be incorporated into the general EC budget .
This is a huge step for transparency , responsibility , openness and communication with citizens .
Even there we manage to get it wrong .
We have a right - in fact a duty - of participation .
The new strategy is about all of us assuming our responsibilities .
Secondly , the regime does not enjoy internal peace in order to concentrate exclusively on promoting a more assertive foreign policy .
In this respect I would suggest better cooperation between the different kinds of funding and an exchange of best practice , together with better dialogue between the supranational , national and regional decision @-@ makers makers within the Community .
Ar@@ gu@@ ably , they should have been applying them in many cases where they have shi@@ ed away from them . But certainly as far as the application of aid sanctions is concerned from the European Union , our position has been a consistent and honourable one .
I should like to ask the Commission what is the status of Mr Van Mi@@ ert &amp; apos ; s communication if today &amp; apos ; s Simpson report goes through ; what will the Commission do now that so little remains of its original ideas ?
The fact that the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office sat for 4 ½ hours at our last meeting showed his commitment .
Firstly , I wish to see that funding for research projects is maintained after 2012 , and I would support the initiatives which encourage young be@@ e@@ keepers into the ap@@ i@@ culture sector .
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.@@ 30 a@@ .@@ m .
It is also best to give local examples to show how this legislation is relevant .
We have a bad international situation and again the report mentions the prospects of the Union having an adequate policy mix .
There are a number of global challenges that we should address at the summit .
I share some of Mr Watts &amp; apos ; concern , however , about Amendment No 1 in relation to the licensing of railway undertakings and the proposed deletion of the replacement Article 12 .
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , having looked into the matter , is satisfied that , upon an issue of the kind before us , Mr P@@ ach@@ eco Pe@@ reira , were he a member of the Portuguese Parliament , would enjoy immunity which could be waived only by the Portuguese Parliament .
In judging the conflicting amend@@ ment@@ s- I as a mere politician have in general put my trust in the Commission &amp; apos ; s air quality experts .
Therefore , for cohesion policy , we need adequate funding at least at the level we have now , if not more into the future .
It would , we hope , give us a new tough set of rules that would ensure that genetically modified crops and other GMO products are used throughout Europe in a safe and sensible way that ensures protection of the environment and guarantees the safety of public health .
As a strong friend of Armenia , I am glad that the final version of the report is more balanced than the initial ones .
Commissioner , thank you for that full substantive answer , which I fully support .
The adoption of this proposal will have a tangible impact on citizens in the countries concerned .
The reality is that we live in a dangerous world in which our liberty is threatened by terrorists , dictators and violent crimes .
P@@ reli@@ min@@ ary work on these proposals has started and it is generally agreed that the concept of the glob@@ ality of the financial perspective negotiations implies not only that individual policy areas must be viewed together in the context of overall expenditure , but also that expenditure must be seen in the context of the overall negotiations , including the question of own resources in all its aspects .
We all know very well in the Commission - very well indeed - what is happening and I can tell you that we really are sensitive about protecting the data of our citizens .
That is an important risk and we must draw our attention to that in future work .
Madam President , I voted for this proposal because it post@@ p@@ ones the folly of an utterly unnecessary waste of even more money on translation services in this House in respect of Irish .
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Tindemans on the completion of this extremely difficult task and thanking him for the extremely flexible way in which he has approached this debate and for the fact that he has been prepared to take on board the observations of other members of the committee .
In other words , the best way , in my opinion , to secure President Klaus &amp; apos ; s signature and the final ratification of the Treaty is simply , Mrs Malmström , to go forward with the whole process and with implementation .
We very much welcome the report by Mr Car@@ raro and his colleagues .
I would hope therefore that we , as a Parliament , might step up our own efforts to participate in this process .
That parliamentarians from Bulgaria and Romania are here today is a welcome reminder that we are negotiating enlargement with 12 applicant states , even if the times@@ cales for accession may differ a little .
Parliament does not have the competence to instruct Member States on what to do in this area .
There have been fourteen other transfers at Director @-@ General General or Deputy Director @-@ General General level , which did not involve promotion in grade , although in four cases relating to Spanish , French , German and British officials , the changes meant advances in responsibility to full Director @-@ General General posts .
So we are not neglec@@ ting the drugs issue .
Mr President , I am not sure whether I take your comments as being a neutral intervention or perhaps more of a ve@@ iled threat .
However , the rhetoric has to be matched with political leadership .
I wish to begin by congratulating you on the state @-@ of of @-@ the the @-@ European European @-@ Parliament Parliament address , which perhaps , like other state @-@ of of @-@ the the @-@ Union Union addresses , should become an annual event .
The Commission has as its objective to promote the harmonisation of the regulations in the field of transport of radioactive material , which would increase safety in the field .
Madam President , on a point of order before I commence , as there does not appear to be anybody asking to speak under the &amp; apos ; catch @-@ the the @-@ eye eye &amp; apos ; procedure - I am subject to correction by you , but I have looked around and assessed the situation - could I add one minute of &amp; apos ; catch @-@ the the @-@ eye eye &amp; apos ; speaking time to my one @-@ minute minute contribution , please ?
Subsidiarity and decentr@@ alization must be the cornerstone of our future policies to ensure that our regional policies are relevant to the needs and interests of local communities .
Mr President , I asked the Commissioner a very clear question : at the moment there is unrest in my country , a big news report on a mission of the Commission agreeing to the export of so @-@ called called secondary resources such as old paper , recycling material , etc .
Coming back to the directive which we are hopefully about to adopt , the Commission considers the final compromise to be properly balanced , to achieve the objectives of health and environmental production , as well as to ensure the availability of pesticides to farmers .
I am glad to say that the Commission will support many of the amendments put forward in these three reports .
In a way , one could say that we are witnessing a move from the Washington consensus to the Copenhagen consensus .
May I now turn to some specific comments .
It is European taxpayers &amp; quot ; money that is involved .
In the south , the Union for the Mediterranean has the potential to make a real difference but , frankly , it has not yet done so , and must be revitalised .
So my colleague would like to conclude with these words : &amp; apos ; For the time being , let me congratulate the Council Presidency and Parliament for their very successful collaboration , which I hope will be endorsed as a first @-@ reading reading agreement by Parliament in view of a final adoption once the WTO notification procedure has been brought to an end in two months &amp; apos ; time &amp; apos ; .
We should hope as well that it will be possible to deliver humanitarian aid quickly and effectively , under international auspices , where it is most needed .
On another level I must highlight the observations of the rapporteur that there is an increased sensitivity amongst Members of Parliament about who makes the decisions on trade : whether it is the Council or the Commission .
In conclusion : Over the last years , regular reporting to the European Parliament on motor insurance issues has become a well @-@ established established practice and I am looking forward to our continued good cooperation .
As requested by the Vienna European Council such a pact should establish a dialogue involving all the actors with responsibility for designing policies which impact on economic growth and employment creation .
So I think one of the first principles which is in the proposals that have come back to us in this long @-@ delayed delayed common position which we have been presented with is that you should put consumer safety - and first , and foremost , information - at the head of our agenda .
Members followed the summit actively and inter@@ acted with the Commission in briefings , summit events , side @-@ events events and so on , all in the interests of representing Europe .
The second element is the strengthening of economic governance , and here the European Parliament has a decisive role .
I urge you not to be blind in one eye and I urge my colleagues likewise .
Your Presidency was a great success .
Yes there may be legal means to get us over the legal nic@@ eties but there is within this a political signal and message and the signal must be , that however we may criticise the Nice Treaty , and we all do , we must get over that hur@@ dle as a precondition politically not to do with enlargement but to do it ourselves .
It is an extremely timely and very important report .
Let me quote the honourable Italian Member Mr I@@ ac@@ ol@@ ino , who called it &amp; apos ; pa@@ trim@@ onia del@@ la civi@@ l@@ ta europea , &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; our common European heritage &amp; apos ; , or Mrs K@@ ing@@ a Gál , who said that free movement is the most tangible result of the unity of the EU .
Members of the European Parliament , before you give this Commission power , remember that 60 years ago , an I@@ ron C@@ ur@@ tain came down on Europe but now , with this Commission , there is an economic iron fist and it is being felt in Greece today .
We have already heard about the question of those refused boar@@ ding .
Indeed , there is no EU @-@ specific specific financing strategy apart from the standard IMF macro @-@ economic economic reform agenda .
The path has been set and the objectives are well known , yet it is up to Serbia to walk down that path , fulfil the required criteria , and , once ready , engage in the negotiation process with the European Union .
When implemented , we on the Industry Committee look forward to the effective completion of the single market in goods with high and effective consumer protection standards .
Members of the European Parliament , led by Gay Mitchell , made an important contribution to that summit and I thank them very much for their participation and support .
One day , Europe will arrive at a situation where the selling of rights can also be done at a European level .
&amp; # 91 ; Trans@@ lation : &amp; apos ; For many years the EU has been speaking about language diversity and respect for minorities .
However , current concerns from Member States are not reactionary , but instead the inevitable consequence of over 20 years of ever @-@ changing changing circumstances in Europe and around the world .
The Commission considers that a clear reference to tax barriers , and particularly to double taxation caused by registration taxes , should be stated in these paragraphs , as is the case under the relevant part of the explanatory statement .
This is the third time I have had the responsibility of being draftsman on the budget for the Committee on Culture and I would particularly like to thank Mr Bourlanges , the budget rapporteur , for his help and cooperation .
Above all we need to engage with our partners to g@@ auge the real level of ambition and see if our ambitious vision of the round is genuinely shared by them .
It is all very well for us to argue as we do for integration into the world economy .
We , in the European Parliament , are looking forward to active cooperation with you and your colleagues throughout the next six months .
But the cohesion policy has the capacity to mobilise regional or local actors across all boundaries in pursuit of European objectives .
Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP @-@ EU EU Assembly that Joint Vice @-@ Presidents Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly .
It is a concept that is contained within similar laws in most of the Member States .
Nevertheless , I will also be visiting that country soon to make up my own mind and have an independent assessment .
It is strange that of all the countries in the world , the European Union has no bilateral agreements with either the United States or Japan .
Given the amount of money we contribute to Israel &amp; apos ; s economy , we carry a grave responsibility when that money contributes to the death of civilians and children .
We are concerned about it , as we should be .
Concerning the answer to frozen conflicts , everybody agrees that finding a peaceful solution is the key to achieving political stability .
It would allow Europe to deliver more effectively on the key challenges we face today in areas like climate change and energy security .
In my view , there should be a clear separation between the management of infrastructure and the operation of services to ensure transparency .
The rapporteur has looked very closely at the possibilities .
The European Union is a massive provider of development assistance .
The Council also discussed ideas on the future of justice and home affairs .
We cannot understand why we cannot be observers at that process .
Since the developed countries have always made it clear that market access questions would have to be discussed in the World Trade Organisation in the context of the Doha development agenda and that there would be no new public funds for development beyond what had been pledged in Monterrey , the positions taken by the G@@ 77 representatives , led by Venezuela , inevitably led to an unfortunate stan@@ do@@ ff between the developing and developed countries .
Why do the EU &amp; quot ; s human rights consultations allow Russia to exclude human rights NGOs and why does our human rights dialogue with China not even benefit from simultaneous language interpretation ?
Having a strong EU delegation - composed of representatives of all the European institutions at the COP - gives the Union an important opportunity to encourage the rest of the world to take more action now in response to the threat of climate change .
He has put it at risk because of his lack of collaboration during the trialogue and during discussions .
For instance , our European response for civil protection will be based , hopefully , on the very good report presented at my request and at the request of Chancellor Schüssel by Michel Barnier .
The report was withdrawn and referred back to committee in the light of other events .
Before closing let me once again thank Parliament for its support in extending the validity of this important instrument .
In this context I find the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s proposal to proceed to a reform of Articles 39 and 59 of the global agreement judici@@ ous .
It also shows how involved all European institutions have been every step of the way .
If the same case happens again , how will the Pact be applied ?
This would be fully in keeping with the current practice , which allows entities that do not constitute states under international law - such as the Ho@@ ly Se@@ e , Palestine and the International Red Cross - to have observer status .
My group wants to ensure that when the European Central Bank is established and when the 11 countries create the euro zone , without prejudice to that price stability , we begin , with some urgency , to address the wider issues within the European Union , not least the question of growth and unemployment .
In this regard , I believe that the reformed cohesion policy has clearly helped to strengthen the position of the outermost regions under the cooperation objective .
It also gives us a very important opportunity to stress once again in public to Turkey that as far as we are concerned : they are a strategically important country ; we recognise their European vocation ; and they will be treated exactly the same as other countries which seek to join in the European Union in terms of applying the Copenhagen criteria .
Does the Commission have any plans to elaborate a common and simple set of rules in order to increase the participation of SMEs in EU research programmes ?
Various considerations should not be used as an ali@@ bi for inaction or for closing the doors to countries that will one day merit membership , such as Ukraine .
On protection , the European Union has done a lot in the last three years .
The UK experience shows that it is possible to have a competitive industry , but that the adjustment process can be tough and painful .
We therefore welcome the proposed abolition of the state security courts , and the Commission will attach due importance to this issue in our report on Turkey in October .
It is an essential component of a number of initiatives currently being developed by the Commission aimed at creating confidence to enable consumers to actively take part in and benefit from the internal market .
So fresh initiatives may well need to be called for , and hence our proposals in the resolution to put the Kurdish issue and Turkey on the agenda of the OSCE and we would like to hear from the Commissioner on this subject and also maybe to explore other avenues .
The S@@ pan@@ i@@ ards have just voted on the Constitution , but the fact is that 90 % of S@@ pan@@ i@@ ards - whom the Europ@@ h@@ iles think were well informed about the Constitution - told Spain &amp; apos ; s state pol@@ ling organisation that they had little or no knowledge of it , and less than half of them bo@@ thered to vote .
Looking back over the past year we can see that some progress has been made , but it has been very slow and , as many people have said to you here today - and I think you know it yourself , Taoiseach - Europe is not inspiring the ordinary people .
There are three things which I would like to emphasise in particular in this Parliament Budget 2001 .
As regards the implementation and enforcement of the EU &amp; apos ; s environmental legislation more generally , the Commission intends to come out with a new communication on this issue later this year .
Therefore I do not believe that the European Parliament should adopt any amendments or there is a risk that the whole directive may be lost .
I believe he will know that Parliament has gone on record against the Helms @-@ Burton Burton legislation on a number of occasions , once in a report which I introduced here .
Mr President , we are discussing the aspirations of Ukraine , Moldova and Georgia .
We will make every effort to ensure that this vision becomes a reality .
This is very much in line with what I have announced as the next logical and necessary step .
I would suggest that it might result in even less financial support to the industry , and markets would not improve .
I would like to include military and civil nuclear materials in the same framework .
The same applies to the United States of America .
I heard one of George Bush &amp; apos ; s climate change advisers telling us , firstly , that climate change was a my@@ th ; secondly , that European scientists were all funded by national governments , that none could be trusted and only American scientists were independent ; and , thirdly , that Commissioner Wallström had admitted that the whole climate change agenda was designed to ensure that European industry was able to catch up and additional burdens were imposed on American industry in order to allow this level playing field to be established .
As a first step , a wide @-@ ranging ranging structured dialogue on migration , mobility and security will be established with those countries , with the aim of securing tangible benefits for them as well as for the EU .
The new Article to be introduced into the directive under the political agreement for the proposal on food and feed will provide for a legal base under which to work .
Mr President , it should not surprise anybody that the EU wants to integrate maritime policy , just as it intends to integrate everything else across Europe in every aspect of life and public policy .
In general , we should all be careful not to introduce changes which might de facto lead to national preferences which are incompatible with Community law and which might end up protecting economic interests .
A new approach to security has been developed , through various processes , with a view to taking more conclusive action against terrorists and preventing new attacks .
I would simply reiterate that the Council is and will remain actively committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other cruel , inhumane or degrading treatment , in line also with the EU guidelines on this subject .
The key principle of the strategy is prevention is better than cure .
We must also help Russia to meet its objective need to avoid being trapped as a possible o@@ il@@ - and gas @-@ dependent dependent power , while we have to achieve our independence from an energy point of view .
To my mind , when a committee of the Parliament is asked by the Committee on Petitions for an opinion they should believe there can be no higher priority than he@@ eding the ple@@ as of the citizen who thinks Europe is not working .
The renewables are recognised as being key technologies for Europe in that they are indigenous sources of energy and can be adapted to different regional conditions .
The new European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights is now also being implemented at full speed , with two calls for proposals for Objective 1 - the difficult countries - and one for human rights defenders under our evaluation by the Commission services .
We will insist that parties negotiate on substance , and not just on process , and that the An@@ apo@@ lis process comes to a successful conclusion .
It is important to understand how compulsory licensing works .
I would like to ask the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office if he is not prepared to re @-@ examine examine the situation in the light of the demographic developments Mr Crowley has talked about .
We have two difficulties with paragraph 1 .
President of the Commission . - First of all , I would like to express my solidarity with the Greek people .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is a bold and unprecedented experiment .
It is time for further action to be taken and for the sanctions to be strengthened and reinforced .
Mr President , the Socialist Group welcomes the statement from the Commission .
We have added recitals explicitly setting this out as an objective of the legislation and tightening those technical requirements to make sure that provision is effective .
the report by Mrs Haug , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the draft amending budget No 10 / 2009 of the European Union for the financial year 2009 , Section III - Commission ( 16@@ 3@@ 27 / 2009 - C7 @-@ 02@@ 88 02@@ 88 / 2009 - ,
The social economy can play a part in meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities arising from these and other processes of change , and in a way can help shape a new model of society and an economy based on solidarity , inclusion and participation on the one hand , and innovation and knowledge on the other .
It is very much hoped that , despite some inevitable inherent weaknesses in this respect , this regulation will turn out to be a success both in theory and in practice .
I would ask that the last two words be deleted and that you accept that as an oral amendment .
It is a question whether passengers are prepared to sacrifice their dis@@ comfort for their safety .
Let me address trade issues in more detail .
As I said , this would have covered a continuation of this level of activity until the end of the year .
Mr President , on a point of order , I would like to invoke Rule 35 with reference to this vote .
To improve the competitiveness of the cof@@ fee sector and broaden the export base in developing countries , we also need to support the full integration of commodity issues into the long @-@ term term development strategies of the developing countries .
At Laeken Heads of State and Government said that within the Union , the European institutions must be brought closer to its citizens , but if we look at the draft articles in the Convention document , we find this ambition has not been achieved .
This was not an isolated incident .
On behalf of the Commission , I should like to say that the Commission shares these concerns .
We should recognize that the goodwill of national governments in the European Union and that of the American administration has ensured that developments have been generally positive .
We in this Parliament should protect the right of workers to take action , to take solidarity action and to enjoy freedom of assembly and I would like to see a little more concern from Mr Skinner for the rights of workers and the free movement of workers , rather than the free movement of goods .
The Galileo question , of course , is very sensitive to all of us and I fully understand the concerns of the Committee on Budgets .
From 2007 on , 1@@ 200 Irish salmon fishermen face the loss of their livelihood due to such legislative and policy changes .
It is important that legislators listen to all sides and get the balance right , guided by the un@@ assa@@ il@@ able principle of safe food for our citizens .
I know Members would wish to discuss the issue , even if not to decide on it .
Food security nowadays lies not only in the local production of food , but in a country &amp; apos ; s ability to finance the import of food through exports of other goods .
The rapporteur looks to Europol and Eurojust to enforce the existing structures across Europe , in cooperation with the judicial forces in each country .
The result of the consultation and legislative process is really an example of openness , contribution , commitment and even a creative innovative approach .
Regarding the financial perspectives , I have already made a commitment to putting forward the proposal for a specific kind of Euro@@ bon@@ d - euro project Euro@@ bonds - and , even though I have already heard some negative comments from some capitals , I am still hopeful that this will come into being .
The involvement of local and regional authorities also during the year will be crucial to its eventual success , as they are in a unique position to ensure that the widest possible access to local community action is achieved .
The core elements of this Directive ensure the protection of surface water , coastal water , internal waste and ground water now and into the future .
Mr President , may I start by congratulating the Commission on the opening words , with which I very much agree .
This is where we are today , so we still hope that Parliament will now provide , as soon as possible , a first reading .
I have to say , however , that progress seems to have considerably slowed down since then .
I believe that there is a broad consensus in this House - not a full but a broad consensus - on the selection process of the next Managing Director of the IMF .
However , that is a credible goal which we hope to achieve .
This study should also address the need to strengthen competition policy instruments to prevent pre@@ d@@ atory pricing and its unwanted side effects .
P@@ ati@@ ents need to be informed objectively and there needs to be a clear barrier between information and advertising .
Of course , the European Union &amp; apos ; s efforts will not be enough , but we cannot hope to have an international agreement if we do not take active leadership regarding this .
We must act and we can because , despite the strong head@@ win@@ ds , the economic fundamentals of the euro area economy are strong , as the President of the Commission says , with domestic demand and exports continuing to grow - a sign that the Lisbon Strategy is working and must be pursued .
It is a very dangerous precedent to set for members of the European public , that they cannot have the right to demonstrate and to highlight their concerns regarding what is happening in Europe .
I think that it is worthwhile drawing attention to the fact that the European Union never endorsed such a boycott , prefer@@ ring discussion and persuasion as a means of trying to seek change within Europe .
How can the Council seriously say that it wants Europe to become the most competitive economy in the world if it is not willing to adopt this critical measure for innovation and growth ?
All they do is suppress the rights of ordinary law @-@ abiding abiding citizens , without them having any right to legal redress .
We need higher employment , we need a better gender balance and we need stronger education .
I am confident that the Commission will take full account of this when it brings forward its thematic strategy on waste .
Amendments which weaken attempts to modernise the directives by reducing the scope for using electronic procurement ; namely Amendments Nos 49 , 50 , 73 , 74 and 103 .
Justice , it seems , is elu@@ ding these brave people and so they have come to us .
I called for the question to be amended to ask the Council to ensure a fair and free ratification procedure .
Mr President , I regret that the concept of social dialogue has been je@@ tti@@ son@@ ed by the Commission with this directive .
I am also proud that the Commission was able to contribute so much to this European Council , feeding the debate with ideas and pointing the way forward .
The end result will be that we will have lost our industry to our non @-@ EU EU competitors while we continue to import poultry and pi@@ g@@ meat from animals that have been fed on precisely the same GM feed that we have denied our producers access to .
My point of order has been up for a very long time and is this : it is becoming an unwelcome practice in this House for oral amendments to be put by Members .
The European Union has stayed the course with Cyprus .
To sum up , debt relief is not a panacea which by itself creates new resources , nor does it automatically translate into services for poor people or economic growth .
We can but live and hope that a peaceful conclusion can be reached in Zimbabwe as it is the people themselves who are suffering most in this unstable situation the country finds itself in .
President of the Commission . - Not only have we revised the rules of the globalisation fund , we have also re@@ program@@ med the European Social Fund with the fast @-@ tracking tracking of EUR 1.@@ 8 billion to reinforce active labour market policies .
in writing . - Our group has supported this text and the line taken by the rapporteur in the sense that it is in favour of the proposal presented , while considering that several points need to be taken into account for the implementation of the regulation .
Clearly criticism can however be level@@ led at a number of Member States which did not stand by the concept of the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
On a broader level , the committee wishes to stress the promotion of both sustainability and territorial cohesion with the need for an integrated approach that would embo@@ dy appropriate spatial planning and foster coherence between the actions eng@@ ende@@ red by all sources of European funding .
No matter the nationality , we have to make Europe without internal borders a reality and ensure equal treatment for all Europeans .
As others have said , we also think that action is important .
If we could be a bit more sophisticated I believe we have a chance of making a success of the imminent discussions .
With the exception of my own Amendment 16 , I do not recommend support for any other amendments .
We are getting conflicting comments from the Commission and from our colleagues in the Committee on Development .
Thank you very much , Mr President , for your concern .
I am sure that as we apply this legislation there will be more legal clarity .
They are happening on a daily basis .
However , to be certain for this legislation to be effective , not only must it be clear and definitive with regard to the role that it wants to carry out , but it must also have the trust of the people that it will protect them and not abuse them .
The President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office said in the previous debate that we should live up to what we say .
Given the added value of Commission aid , and the Commission &amp; apos ; s new role in coordinating the Union &amp; apos ; s and the Member States &amp; apos ; development policy ( Article 2@@ 10 TFEU ) , the share of ODA chann@@ elled through the EU budget should remain at least stable .
That should be our main focus in the next parliament .
I urge the Romanian Government to consider concluding these adoptions , in particular the 1 100 pipeline cases of or@@ ph@@ ans and abandoned children for whom caring foreign families had registered adoption petitions prior to the January 2005 ban .
It is extremely important that our problems are understood by you and by European politicians .
Finally , I would also draw attention to the question of the legal base .
This is of pressing concern considering the recent disaster in the Gulf of Mexico with the De@@ ep@@ water H@@ ori@@ zon explo@@ sion and oil spill .
I want to thank you once again for a very responsible and substantive debate and congratulate the rapporteurs on their important contributions to this debate .
I also find it quite alarming that this treaty basically endorses the whole concept of a European constitution which is something that has not been debated in the national parliaments .
This is being done , but it has still to be seen how fast , and through what policy measures , European Union Member States will return to their path of growth .
We have an integrated area here and we therefore need to have a common approach .
Mr President , with the accession of nine new Member States to the Schengen area , which is a true and final falling of the historical I@@ ron C@@ ur@@ tain , the EU has truly given the opportunity to their European citizens to travel and fr@@ ater@@ n@@ ise in a reciprocal manner .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I apologise for taking up everyone &amp; apos ; s time and delaying lunch but I do it only once in 10 years so maybe you will not mind .
I am sure that Parliament is properly under control for that period .
But the simple truth is that the European Union will not work without greater qualified majority voting ...
We have to deal with the realities of life .
We should never condemn people who are forced to seek asylum or refugee status .
The interim agreement also signed on 9 April provides for the trade @-@ related related provisions of the agreement to enter into force from 1 June 2001 , without having to wait for the formal ratification of the agreement by national parliaments .
We need legally @-@ based based rights , as this report points out , at an international level .
I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the European Parliament for its excellent cooperation in facilitating the financing of these very important missions .
Finally - I am not going to go into the details of the amendments - I am happy to say that the committee adopted the amendments almost unanimously , with the single exception of the British Conservatives . They will no doubt explain why that was so .
Finally three very quick points which I do not have the time to develop .
As mentioned earlier , many organisations are eligible for this funding .
I commend the Commissioner and what she is doing , because it is a very complex situation and one that we need to sort out .
The Commission is also pleased to acknowledge the sound political support it received from the NGOs present at the meeting .
Indeed , it seems that the most important and most sensitive issue concerns where we stand on Eurojust .
There are three things I would like him to consider at the European Council and later on .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Jensen , for the considerable and valuable contribution which she has made .
Some time ago the company concerned made considerable additional investments so the government could have given some aid for this . But they preferred to continue to give operational aid which I suppose they must know is not acceptable under the rules of state aid in the European Union .
It is also my firm belief that something must be done to rid the Union of its red @-@ tape tape image amongst the people of Europe .
The majority of citizens still say they know very little or do not know enough about the European Union and its institutions , they are not able to follow what is being done in the European Parliament or the Commission .
Belarus is currently under enormous pressure to reinforce its borders with Russia and the Ukraine to avoid any further influx of immigrants , and the European Union must cooperate in this area , irrespective of the nature of the government in Minsk .
I would also like to say that I share the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s opinion in underlining the importance of education and training , something that has been noted by other speakers .
The Commission will be reporting on this situation again in April and , of course , we are also available in the European Parliament .
It is with great pleasure that I am able at last to present these two reports , the general revision of the rules and a particular report which has been waiting even longer to be put on our agenda .
EU @-@ wide wide dissemination and re@@ plic@@ ation of innovative approaches can give authorities the possibility to achieve more and better results at lower cost .
The overall objective remains to improve the efficiency and coherence of our collective efforts , and I think cooperation between the three institutions will be key to success in the long run .
I was pleased to hear that the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have recognised this fact .
I signal openly to the rapporteur that I will seek to remove this suggestion from what , as I have already said , is otherwise a very constructive report .
It is in large part about coordinating the exercise of national competences whilst making full use of the European Union competences and instruments available .
My group supported these amendments when the focus was on the substance but at this stage it is better to concentrate on the issue of whether the Commission or Council has implementing powers so that we in Parliament state l@@ ou@@ dly and in un@@ is@@ on that our interests lie in backing the Commission .
Mr President , it is always argued that an increase in global trade eng@@ ende@@ red by the removal of trade barriers is a means of achieving greater prosperity and higher living standards for all .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Within the framework of the third European Action Programme on Road Safety up to 2010 , a number of actions were implemented to combat speeding , drug and drink driving as well as to improve road infrastructure .
Here , I think , good governance , democracy , human rights and the rule of law are the focus of our policies , in order for them to slowly go in the right direction .
in writing . I am particularly supportive of the amendment which calls for the promotion of ILO core labour standards and decent work agenda .
My group believes that foreign policy is an area where deci@@ dedly we need more Europe , including a Europe with a security and defence capacity .
Given the importance of our large store of common North Atlantic values , this summit should assert that Canada and the EU will hen@@ ce@@ forth cooperate proactively in foreign and security policy and on environmental questions .
Therefore , the Commission can support Amendment No 4 which strengthens the recital text on this point .
To really advance towards genuine energy solidarity , the Member States should start to inform each other and the Commission on their agreements with third partners .
I suggest to you that one of the things that we must work on is to ensure that small and medium sized enterprises get the benefits of this revolution .
I think the summit has come up with a number of important decisions , but at the same time I am of the opinion that we need more , and we need to move faster .
The weakness of the system is shown by our inability to obtain a Council statement on Iraq .
I have a couple of questions for the Commissioner .
Mr President , we should not turn a blind eye to blatant human rights violations taking place in the three countries .
So what I propose is having a clear discussion , maybe within the Committee on Fisheries .
I have tried to turn it around and say that it is an ingeni@@ ous protocol , because it combin@@ es sound science and the way the United Nations has put together the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change is unprecedented .
The future of the Western Balkans is clearly in the European Union .
That some Irish members should vote against such a proposal is incomprehensible given that the European Foundation for Li@@ ving and Working Conditions in Dublin would be in line to carry out such work .
The enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May this year also substantially strengthens the legal basis for Community action in favour of the equality between men and women .
I would just like to make one or two final comments .
That said , the end result that we have is an open and reasonably balanced one .
At the same time , we got the clear message from the Member States that we should look for a system which would not be too burdensome or too complicated for the national authorities , because it would be the Member States who would have to verify that the signatures collected for the citizens &amp; apos ; initiative are real and genuine .
There are no rules in the European Union ; it does as it wishes .
Member of the Commission . - I think we have a rather good track record when we start the procedures .
As regards the amendments tabled to our proposal for a Council regulation , we all have to keep in mind that the discussions were very lively in the Council .
Human rights are not guaranteed in either country , nor are religious or other rights .
The Egyptians are also considering that possibility with different intensity .
I would suggest that in the longer term job increases will be the order of the day as a result of these developments .
The promotion of regional integration is one of the cornerstones of the partnership .
I hope that Commissioner Michel will provide an answer to the questions &amp; apos ; Where do we go from here ? &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; How do we move forward ? &amp; apos ;
We acknowledge the concerns raised in the report with regard to the divergent regulatory requirements applicable to the distribution of substitute products , and stress that the Commission has an open mind on whether there is a substantive issue that needs to be tackled .
We can look further east and see potential danger and potential fr@@ ac@@ ture with what is happening in the Middle East .
In terms of some of the aspects that were raised in the questions and in your intervention , competition instruments have been useful and shall continue to be useful , but I am not excluding that at any moment , the Commission , where appropriate , will use the regulatory powers that we have .
Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and the Commissioner for her interest and , indeed , involvement in this important issue .
Last week &amp; quot ; s European Council referred the issue to the first General Affairs and External Relations Council under the Irish presidency .
The Summit failed to agree an effective regime to supervise the financial system in Europe .
I know it is difficult and will require a lot of statesmanship by all the Members of the Council and all the Heads of State and Government present .
Mr President , the operation of 15 different systems for the taxation of passenger cars within the European Union has resulted in tax obstacles , distortions and in@@ effici@@ encies which prevent both the European citizens and the car industry , and trade , from fully benefiting from the advantages of the single market .
It is a Treaty language and it should have that status .
In particular I support the call for the Commission to carry out and submit a study on compliance with Community labour , health and safety legislation and on respect for the social rights of workers on this type of vessel , and on their living and working conditions on board .
Auth@@ ori@@ tative instructions , which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey , though contrary to the dea@@ rest convictions of his judgement and conscience , are utterly unknown to the laws of the land and against the tenor of our constitution . &amp; apos ;
It is the clear indication of a lack of political will by the Council of Ministers to have the heart of a Community structure function properly .
I understand that 12 visits to Strasbourg per annum are part of the Treaty and we are signed in , but in a rational and calm way .
It is essential to have a proper expenses regime and to have a common salary .
There are not enough European lead projects . I would like to see the Urban programme and other European @-@ led led initiatives - five , six at the most - remain so that the people can see that this comes from the European Union .
in writing . - EU Member States and the Council must take the lead in negotiating an international treaty aimed at introducing a ban on the development , production , stockpiling , transfer , testing and use of uranium weapons .
The report emphasises the importance of the swit@@ ch@@ over from an@@ alogue , which is on track in the UK but lagging in some other EU member states .
Madam President , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten Ruijten for this report .
Mr President , September 11 , the attacks on the twin to@@ wers in New York , opened up a new chapter in the concept of war - namely , an asymmetric , large @-@ scale scale attack by a well @-@ organised organised and well @-@ resourced resourced , fan@@ atic , international , Islam@@ ist grouping af@@ fili@@ ated to al @-@ Qa Qa &amp; apos ; ida , with no respect for the traditional rules and conduct of war as we know them and very difficult to formally classify under the Third and Fourth Geneva Pro@@ tocols of 19@@ 49 .
We will carry out research on preventative measures and medicine .
We therefore have a mechanism for giving them more capacity @-@ building building and more institution @-@ building building , because we can see that sometimes the institutions are weak .
Lastly , I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes , what I said at the outset of my remarks : that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate , largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening .
This is a crisis that we should not ignore .
It is why we have to engage the leaders in Bosnia to get them to get their eyes off the floor , to get them from thinking only about their own communities to thinking about the needs of their country , and to see their future and to see the European Union .
There are still substantial problems with this draft regulation and the Council and the Commission are working very hard to resolve the issue .
I wonder whether the sort of measure to allow codes of conduct to continue for the existing professions is adequately dealt with under Amendments Nos 20 and 21 .
Finally , with reference to the Lisbon Treaty , I was very pleased to hear the comments of the Slovenian presidency last week on the 2008 work programme with regard to their response for the &amp; apos ; One Mil@@ lion S@@ ign@@ atures for Disability &amp; apos ; campaign .
Mr President , the Council admits in its text on the broad economic guidelines that since it presented its broad economic guidelines to Parliament in July 1995 , the situation in Europe has deteriorated in contrast to what was expected .
If there are problems with the current system of cross @-@ compliance compliance , how are we going to address the potential of further problems if we deepen the requirements on the environmental side of pillar one , which is something contained in the leaked document on the reform of the CAP ?
However , we need also , as Mrs Smet has said , a much wider range of initiatives designed to tackle the structural disadvantages suffered by women on the labour market .
The fact that the very comprehensive report on transatlantic economic relations has the input of half a do@@ zen committees of this Parliament , and that it would need at least the same number of Commissioners present to discuss all the issues that are covered in it , shows how deep and in@@ tric@@ ate the EU @-@ US US economic relationship is .
I also take this opportunity to condemn yesterday &amp; apos ; s horrific events in Turkey .
Mr President , let me disagree with the previous speaker .
Otherwise we will be unable to integrate the Roma community into European society and bring it into the European order .
Finally , business would prefer a leng@@ thi@@ er transition period ; they would also prefer the Commission to look at more than just the market share in assessing market power .
It may be that , in the end , there will be some redund@@ ancy , but there are different points being made .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjour@@ ned on Thursday , 4 December 2003 . ( 1 )
The presidency will inform the European Parliament on the progress achieved in this field in accordance with Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union .
Let me also introduce a new issue to the debate , and one which should feature in the Single Market Review , which is e @-@ government government .
By nature , all these energies are decentralised and will , therefore , have to be implemented at local level .
Like most British people I really do not understand or believe our Prime Minister on this matter .
But migration will be manageable only when we manage the despair that leads so many to risk so much to come here .
I do not think that there is necessarily a correlation there , but in all the studies and work that various bodies are doing , including us in the Commission , perhaps there would be a role for financial education .
To achieve lasting peace it is clear that a strong Palestinian Authority needs to speak for all Palestinians and that it needs to be committed to a two @-@ state state solution through peaceful means .
. Mr President , to call this a debate about the future of Europe is frankly far@@ ci@@ cal .
Firstly , the idea of including the B@@ oth@@ nia line in the trans@@ European networks is not - to use Mr Wi@@ be &amp; apos ; s phrase - ruled out , simply because there has to be a revision of the guidelines in 1999 .
The seriousness of our concerns has been clearly stated through the three statements published by the EU Presidency over the past two weeks : on 4 and 10 June , over the cases of Mr F@@ ad@@ a@@ ei , Mr S@@ ho@@ ja@@ e@@ e and Mr J@@ az@@ e@@ e , all facing imminent executions for crimes committed when they were minors ; and on 13 June , on the execution of Moham@@ mad H@@ ass@@ an@@ z@@ ade@@ h .
I would like that proposal to be minu@@ ted .
It will not be a surprise to you that the Commission cannot agree to the proposed change to a directive , for the following reasons . The Commission &amp; apos ; s 1996 communication on implementing Community environmental law noted a disparity between Member States &amp; apos ; inspection systems and recognised the necessity of ensuring that minimum inspection tasks were performed .
Finally , I would like to draw special attention to the importance of paragraph 9 in our report , which stresses once again that notwithstanding the emphasis in all the regulatory activity in recent years on increasing access @-@ based based competition , our long @-@ term term goal has to remain facilities @-@ based based competition .
Mr President , I wish to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to the Italian presidency , Mr Din@@ i , and to the Commission President , Mr Santer , for their valuable contributions to this debate here this morning .
Are budget deficits to be com@@ pressed drastically while the private sector is cutting its activity dramatically ?
That is , Member States &amp; apos ; taxpayers &amp; apos ; money is spent by the Member States .
However , we believe that the Council weakened the text and so I would like to call on colleagues to support the amendments which were adopted in committee to improve the common position .
This seems to be a version of &amp; apos ; honour amongst thi@@ eves &amp; apos ; in that it is the countries involved in the arms industry which will make the decisions , and countries which have an ethical position as regards arms exports will have no say .
We also agree with the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s amendments seeking to restrict the derogation for safety to vessels less than 12 metres in length and we would like to thank her for re@@ tabling these important amendments .
This behaviour does not help in finding a solution .
However , to my disappointment , I had to read about the latest version of the proposals in the media .
There is a real danger for this Parliament and for the people who elect us that this will be one of our few moments of involvement with the draft directive , and indeed the final directive on the contained use of genetically modified organisms ; that once this directive is adopted - as I think it will be - we will no longer be able to exercise any supervisory role .
These were considerable achievements but it is important , now we have launched the process , we do not allow other political priorities like a single currency to push enlargement into the background where it would be in danger of becoming bogged down in technical discussions .
We have a very demanding and challenging task in front of us but I believe that with real commitment - commitment that this Parliament has shown in the past - we can deliver on this , with innovation , with more technological investment and of course working with our main partners .
We have a comprehensive programme which we feel will help to unlock the situation in our country .
We are aware too that the European Union is less efficient than its competitors at exploiting the ideas we have .
We should build on the collective force of the two institutions to advance this important issue .
The EU stance against the death penalty is based on the firm belief in the inherent dignity of all human beings and the in@@ viol@@ ability of the human person .
Colleagues , I interrupt the one @-@ minute minute speeches on matters of political importance in order to make an announcement .
The question I would like to ask the Commissioner is : is there any problem about fishermen from other countries getting involved ?
As part of the European Parliament &amp; quot ; s delegation , I had an opportunity to observe parliamentary elections in Moldova .
I also have to ask why , when the Commission is ambitious enough - quite rightly - to want to reform the whole of European governance , it does not put at the centre of that strategy a radical re@@ working and modernisation of its communications and information policy .
I am convinced , Commissioner , that the Commission will do everything it can to bring the negotiations to a close in 2009 .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank Parliament and , in particular , its rapporteurs for its very constructive reaction to the Commission &amp; apos ; s Green Paper on market @-@ based based instruments .
In addition , we are in favour of the proposal to keep buses of more than 12 , but less than 15 , metres with two ax@@ les , still serving public transport in some Member States , since this does not , as far as we are concerned , jeopardise safety .
We expect this to be before its presentation in February .
In Europe we have experience of having to balance different legal traditions and practices and that is one reason we should be taking the lead in the future of regulation .
Mr President , whilst the Commission is very keen on defending our human rights , we British have known since the thir@@ te@@ enth century exactly where we have stood .
I think - and I have said it before - that it was a Presidency full of substance and style , and I thank you very much for that , Chancellor Schüssel .
We want : binding targets , not indicative cut targets ; a rational definition of renewable energy - energy from waste , which is to be inciner@@ ated anyway , is a good idea .
I am pleased to say that this opinion is shared by the European Parliament - as evidenced by the report drawn up by the rapporteur , for which I thank her very much indeed , on of the Commission &amp; apos ; s behalf .
It was important for him to attend the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that is taking place now .
We cannot accept the proposal to allow the continuation of s@@ will @-@ feeding feeding using catering waste .
During the first half of 2009 , the Czech Presidency is paying particular attention to employment measures also , within the context of the spring European Council .
It is failing to delivery security from fear , even though we talk a lot about creating an area of freedom , security and justice .
That is why we have launched a common invitation to tender for an audiovisual strategy to cover the issues concerning enlargement and the future of Europe .
I give you my promise to work closely with you in the massive task ahead of us .
I should also like to state quite clearly that my committee , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , supports this proposal and hopes that it will go forward smoothly .
There has been good customs cooperation between the authorities in the relevant Member States and the Commission in order to provide that particular precise information on the real data regarding imports .
This is before considering the potential in the developing world for feeding the starving , growing crops in d@@ rought @-@ ri@@ dden ri@@ dden and sal@@ ine soils , recti@@ fying vi@@ tam@@ in deficiencies and so preventing disease for millions .
The report is about the assessment of the gender equality road map between 2006 and 2010 but , of course , we have to be more ambitious .
The high proportionate amount of tax compliance for small companies is a big obstacle , and that is why we need to do our best to call for cross @-@ border border loss relief , simplified customs procedures , one @-@ stop stop @-@ shop shop schemes for VAT , home states taxation pilot projects and so on . We support everything that the Commission has done in this respect .
Moreover , resulting from such controls and investigations and the communication of possible cases of fraud or ir@@ regularity to OLAF , the honourable Member may be aware that there are regulatory arrangements in place under Regulation ( EC ) No 16@@ 81 / 94 , which provides that the Member States shall report to the Commission , at the appropriate stage , the details of their investigation into such possible cases of fraud or ir@@ regularity .
Of all of the issues we debated this week , this is a crucial one for our consumers , but also our producers .
Whilst useful progress was made in cleaning up the text of the action plan , large parts - including some key EU objectives - have not been agreed .
By building on local knowledge , by involving all the relevant actors on the ground and by improving the visibility of the European cohesion policy , we will certainly enhance the impact and the quality of European cohesion investment .
And , thirdly , food security , and all that it implies to the European Union , involves cost .
I support the extension of Article 186 if you needed to pay out this EUR 280 million , which I regard as symbolic rather than significant .
That is one of the reasons why we need to address the political situation urgently and the special envoy is doing mag@@ nific@@ ent job in the region .
I also accept the request for a report to the Parliament and Council before 1 January 2008 , on the use of these substances as feed additives together , where appropriate , with a legislative proposal concerning further use within the time limits as established in Amendment No 14 .
I regret the sp@@ at that has taken place between the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Development over which has the lead role on EPAs , because Parliament itself could have reacted more coherently at certain points when the EPA negotiations were in practice , losing sight of the promise that these were development instruments .
It also calls on the Court of Auditors to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the agencies &amp; apos ; approach to the management of situations where there is a potential conflict of interests .
Madam President , as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I want to associate myself very much with many of the remarks - in fact , all the remarks , I think - that people have made on the work that Catherine Stihler has done .
This means that in the new Rules to be published in time for the new Parliament - indeed , presumably in time for the enlarged Parliament in May - the figures in our Rules will automatically be adjusted to suit the expanded size of Parliament .
So my main point is that on the question of the interinstitutional agreement - the new interinstitutional agreement in particular - the next Parliament must be much more careful to see what will happen .
We have to keep our word and stick to the accession perspective of Turkey as outlined in the negotiation mandate .
Europe does not choose to defend certain communities or minorities . It insists on defending everyone &amp; apos ; s human rights .
Such sanctions could include , for example , the extension of the visa ban or the freezing of assets in the Member States .
As I have said , this is a very flu@@ id situation and we have to read it very carefully .
As regards the existing directive and its implementation , most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive .
Real solutions , therefore , lie in the hands of politicians coordinating their actions at government level .
I am very happy that , in combination with what we have here on renewables , other regulations in place in Europe are changed .
The main problem will be whether the United States will ratify and of course this is not a fo@@ reg@@ one conclusion .
in writing . - At a time when the Commission , and indeed this Parliament , ought to be searching for , and bringing forward , proposals on how to save money , we are offered this report which suggests the completion of the Galileo satellite navigation system at an additional cost of EUR 1.@@ 9 billion in the next Multi@@ annual Financial Framework .
But there is one thing that the European Union could constructively do here , at least until the recession is over , and that is to give car manufacturers a break from environmental restrictions .
At a time when rising food and oil prices are leading to great expectations for action , we cannot afford to abandon this path .
No one imagin@@ es you can run a modern economy without regulation but , equally , excessive regulation can be hugely damaging , and the Commission &amp; apos ; s own figures prove it .
Let us tell our European citizens with courage that the &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; vote in Ireland did not solve the problem that the Lisbon Treaty was intended to solve , that there is tough competition out there , that the world will not wait for Europe and that the world needs a Europe that is more than ever present , not only for the benefit of its citizens but also for the promotion of its values .
Following the public consultation , the proposal would be submitted to a regulatory committee procedure requiring support from a qualified majority of Member States before being adopted as a formal Commission decision .
However , the present state of preparation is a matter for concern .
I do hope that this directive can be implemented sooner rather than later .
Energy - efficient technologies ; 2 .
At the same time , we are open to discussing with the Member States - and with the Parliament of course - several options regarding the possibility of Euro@@ bonds , provided the Member States are willing to consider that possibility .
Mr President , I will not repeat what has been said already but will limit myself to one general point which I feel has not been adequately covered so far , and that is the accession costs .
I fully share your views on the need for a fact @-@ based based public debate on EU accession .
It is true that some workers would like to work fewer hours , but not if the cut in hours means a drop in pay .
We should not try to hide behind some false pretence that it is going to change the way Europe operates forever .
The Commission equally fully supports the implementation of the arms embargo and has prepared the legislation for the Council to be effective immediately .
Above all , it should begin to identify the sort of choices that Europe needs to make for the future in the economy , social policy , the environment , transport , and the budget - the sort of Europe that the two great political families , the centre left and centre right of politics in Europe , actually look for . That would provide , at the European elections of 2004 , a real choice between the proposals of the centre left and the proposals of the centre right .
Therefore , Madam High Representative , I would like you to support calling for a pan @-@ European European forum on the future of Belarus .
I welcome the Commission &amp; apos ; s support for extending the transitional period so that , when we do have the new legislation , all countries will have the same legislation .
First of all , Madrid should be an opportunity to enhance the political dimension of our bi @-@ regional regional strategic partnership .
I should like to conclude by thanking , once again , not only the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , but also the members of the various committees involved , for their constructive and very positive efforts .
And to the EU I say , engage with both the Palestinian Government and with the Israeli Government .
We hope that Parliament will give overwhelming endorsement to the report and we look to speedy progress towards an appropriate outcome .
Solidarity and responsibility are the key words in our response .
I am increasingly saddened by the fact that every time we have a debate around these issues , it desc@@ ends into a very intoler@@ ant debate around sexual health and reproductive rights for women .
Madam President , first of all I would like to thank Commissioner Fischer for his statement , and say to him that on Wednesday of next week we want either President Prodi or Commissioner Byrne to come to Parliament to make a clear statement on what measures the Commission intends to take following the publication of the scientific conclusions later today .
Part of the problem - I say this particularly to the Commissioner because I know he is sympathetic to this - is that despite the fact that the single market is at the centre of economic reform of the Lisbon goals , when a simple proposal for reform is put forward we are in the extraordinary position that a significant number of Member States oppose it and , indeed , Members seek to change and dilute it .
We recognise that the international NGOs are in a more difficult situation , as regards access to the stric@@ ken areas .
I am very pleased to see Commissioner Fischler here to listen to this debate .
Mr President , in relation to the two budgetary votes , may I point out that a lot of people are asking : what contribution can the European budget make in terms of a fiscal stimulus in times of economic crisis ?
Our objective was to pass on to sheep ( and goat ) farmers an increase in the annual premium but to keep within the expenditure limits set out in Agenda 2000 and keep us on track for CAP reform .
There was a discussion about the definition of &amp; quot ; poverty &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; social income &amp; quot ; .
Europe &amp; apos ; s cultural diversity is one of our great treasures and my group , the European Free Alliance , is committed to safeguarding this diversity .
So the Commission plans to publish the relevant communication this summer , i.e. in a very short time from now .
For example , I am open to putting into the envelope certain ideas concerning innovation and the restructuring of wine sellers , but I think we still need to keep a clear demarcation line between what is possible within the national envelopes and what is possible within rural development policy , to avoid a situation where you can actually finance an investment from both sides , what is called the &amp; apos ; double gu@@ ichet &amp; apos ; .
I appreciate that there are some concerns in this House - and specifically in the Committee on Fisheries - about the potential impact of Papua New Guinea &amp; apos ; s tuna imports on the EU industry .
Instead , we are doing the opposite with cal@@ am@@ it@@ ous consequences for that unhappy country .
First of all , on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , Mr Karl @-@ Heinz Heinz Florenz , I should like formally to move the oral question , the subject of which is the EU strategic objectives for the 13@@ th meeting of the CITES Convention .
To better implement anti @-@ discrimination discrimination and harassment practices it is necessary to engage stakeholders at grass @-@ roots roots level , through information campaigns , use of NGOs , and also by more formal instruments such as including special provisions in collective agreements and national legislation relative to gender equality .
No one has yet succeeded in reassuring me about the effects of the Commission proposal in both these respects , which is why I am not only supporting the 150 @-@ gram@@ me gram@@ me compromise but asking for a thorough review or reviews on the effects for universal service provision before any other proposal or proposals come forward .
Will the Commission say what additional means - compatible with Community rules on state aid - are available to Member States during the current economic crisis to help SMEs , in particular to support their access to funding ?
I would like to thank the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office for that comprehensive reply .
That is not to suggest that we should somehow weaken our position in relation to our demands on the countries .
For the Serbs as a whole we must make it clear that , as soon as there is a solution to the problem of Kosovo , we will want to lift sanctions .
In fact , Gulf countries expressed their determination to conclude the free trade agreement and recognise the importance of further flexibility on the issue .
Under it , if a candidate country does not meet EU safety standards , it will not be allowed to sell food products in the internal market .
We hope that the intensive consultations undertaken with the Secre@@ taries @-@ General General and Presidents of this Parliament and of the other institutions will facilitate the support that is essential to the changes that are necessary to fulfil , I remind the House , the clear reform mandate given specifically to the Prodi Commission by this House and by the European Council .
In its relations with the Ethiopian authorities , the Commission is continuously stressing the importance of reforms , including the implementation of the recommendations of the EU Election Observation Mission in 2005 .
Parliament and Council have adjusted the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal on mergers , mas@@ ter @-@ fe@@ eder fe@@ eder @-@ structures structures , fund notification and key investor information , but the high @-@ level level ambitions set by the Commission in its original proposal was fully respected .
In order to deal properly with all these ideas for the medium and long term , I want to establish a working group with experts from the Member States and the Commission so they can go to the heart of these issues .
In that respect I think we should use the example of the ap@@ pare@@ l industry to press for new thinking about the way in which policy ought to regulate markets for the benefit of all .
At the same time we must remember that this is one side of the co@@ in .
In order to achieve that objective , the Community needs to get involved in the EPLA , which addresses shared responsibilities between Member States and the Community .
Parliament , of course , was determined that the Board had to be more than a rubber stamp for the Commission &amp; apos ; s report .
The Presidency starts at a critical time for the European Union and I wish it well , but I confess I have misgivings .
I have spoken in Parliament during highly charged debates on terrorism , on terrorist acts and capital punishment , against the use of capital punishment .
First of all , I would like to single out for particular appreciation your rapporteur , Mrs Paulsen , for her enormous efforts and tireless work over these months in pursuing a rapid agreement with the Commission and the Council towards early implementation of the proposed regulation .
Countries where the population gre@@ w by 3 % or more just a few years ago will experience negative growth .
Th@@ ought has been given to this ; my officials have noted this issue as one requiring attention and it will be dealt with at a technical level .
V@@ ig@@ il@@ ance and transparency are key if confidence is to be restored in markets .
However , we welcome the guidelines for an adequate consideration of international and European asylum and human rights law within the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal ( COM ( 2009 ) 06@@ 58 final ) .
I suspect that might happen in plenary , certainly if a number of our amendments , which , as I understand , will be supported by the ELDR Group , fail to get through .
We wish to return the directive to the Commission for them to do that assessment .
That is the challenge for the future ; that is the challenge that we , as democrats , have to take on board .
We support the main thrust of this report .
As a whole , my group was satisfied with the tone and balance of the point , which is why we have not tabled any amendments .
The requirement for Member States to notify the Commission of specific critical infrastructures is counter @-@ productive productive , as it would produce a list of targets that would be of great interest to the wrong people .
It has been a critical area which has been neglected for a number of years , because the lack of visibility within the EU , in particular within the Member States , has been lamentable and there was , and still is , a need for better direction within DG X and our own information policy within Parliament .
We know that the transport sector is very bad in Europe and we still have a lot to do when it comes to railways and transportation time through Europe .
Mr President , I should like to thank the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council and the President of the Commission for an excellent job .
Incre@@ mentally it has transformed the European Community of 198@@ 4 into the quite different European Union that we have today , a Union with a wider scope of responsibility , with at least partially more effective institutions and with greater democratic accountability .
The three chair@@ persons last week sent an invitation for an informal meeting between the steering committee in charge of this issue in Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
Finally , I am very happy to see Parliament &amp; apos ; s enthusiasm - and , in particular , that of my good friend Doris Pack - for the European capitals of culture and Sar@@ aj@@ evo &amp; apos ; s interest in holding the title .
But given the fact that examination of this proposal is ongoing in the Council , and given the Commission &amp; apos ; s strong desire to address this issue in a timely manner , I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this time is for the Commission not to formally accept the amendments put forward by Parliament , but to endeavour to take them on board , as much as possible , during the negotiations in the Council .
That may be regarded by some Members of some Councils as being a touch brutal in its assessment of the powers of the Council but it is entirely true .
We must continue to pursue the eradication of F@@ MD on an international level .
in writing . - Keeping a record of all debates and making them available to the public could help Euro @-@ scepticism scepticism .
I believe that the utmost respect must be paid to the need for social , economic , regional cohesion , and that the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of regions highly dependent on fisheries .
Finally , our commitment is to fund human and social development in the world &amp; apos ; s poorest countries .
As Mr de So@@ to noted , we do not expect progress to be easy , and the success of the UN process is far from assured .
Therefore , there is a strong case for flexibility and with that one reservation I support Mr Azzolini &amp; apos ; s report in total .
It is not enough to focus so firmly on job protection , trying to keep current jobs alive even when the market has moved on .
We therefore need to coordinate our efforts to fully harness the four basic freedoms with regard to this region and so achieve a new brand for it as one of the most attractive and rapidly developing in the EU .
The Commission , I must tell you very frankly , is in a very aw@@ k@@ ward situation in these debates because we are not the authors of these initiatives .
The governments need to take their responsibility for waste seriously , but so do all of us as individuals .
Now is the time , at last , to do something about it .
I hope the Council and the Commission also condemn those articles .
I would be grateful for the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s thoughts on that , but otherwise broadly support this report and her efforts .
The ongoing preparation of the 10th EDF Water Facility identifies in particular the potential offered by public water operators , who provide over 90 % of water and sanitation services globally .
So is a mechanism to drive change in a dynamic way , which is best achieved , in my view , by engaging all stakeholders in a structured manner .
While both Parliament and the Council welcomed the simplification process , these proposals generated a very substantial debate .
I therefore dissoci@@ ate myself , on behalf of the victims in my country , from the eu@@ logy to a con@@ feder@@ ate of world terrorism .
Finally , I would just like to say that the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s amendments calling for greater self @-@ evaluation evaluation and participation of stakeholders inser@@ ts a valuable co@@ g in the evaluation machine .
I was particularly pleased to hear Mrs Malmström &amp; apos ; s comments about the G20 Pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh representatives needing to agree to significant coordination in the continued support of stimulus measures , in the un@@ winding of these support measures when appropriate , and a determined coordinated effort on future regulation .
As you know , the European Commission is a firm supporter of the ILO &amp; apos ; s decent work agenda .
I suppose what I am asking you is about the levels of organised crime within Europe .
So you ought to be clear about what the Foreign Secretary said .
We will be looking very carefully , for example , at how the broad economic guidelines will be prepared , at just how successful the input of the Social Affairs and Employment Council will be in emphasising the need for employment and social cohesion when it formul@@ ates the broad economic guidelines .
Chancellor Merkel , I believe that your personal commitment to it , your personal history and your understanding of the importance of freedom for your country and for Europe was decisive in creating that spirit among all the leaders in Berlin .
Last but not least , I refer to the diminishing species of the small- and medium @-@ sized sized fishing enterprises of the smaller Mediterranean Member States like my country , Cyprus .
That is why I have tabled an amendment on the report on the euro and tourism to highlight that to the Commission and the Council of Ministers .
I would also like to welcome Mr Maystadt to this plenary because it is very important that the Commission also congratulate him and the EIB for his continued forceful response to the effect of the global financial crisis .
I hope we can achieve that .
If they come to clear conclusions , then it is only our duty to react immediately .
I will , therefore , cover some of them but not because I would not be able to answer all the questions asked .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , and in particular their respective rapporteurs , Mr No@@ bili@@ a and Mr Purvis , for their open and constructive work on this proposal .
Mr President , whenever we discuss human rights we seem to be talking about a virtual EU : a European Union that exists only in Parliament resolutions , Commission press rele@@ ases and Council communi@@ qu@@ és .
While I am alive to the burden being imposed on fishing communities by higher oil prices at the moment , there are many other forums in which a fuller and fran@@ ker exchange can be held on the future of the common fisheries policy .
Secondly , in regard to the point being put forward by several Members of the Council that there should be further institutional change prior to enlargement , what impetus or weight will the Luxembourg Presidency give to this ?
It should be an investment that we undertake on a long @-@ term term basis , not just for ensuring the survival of those countries , but also for their real development as functional economies and democracies .
We encourage those contacts and projects that are in line with international law , and we criticise when they are not in line with international law .
If you really want the floor , I will now have to give it to you but please do not just ask for the floor just to express some kind of disagreement with the process .
Two slight problems in conclusion , President .
R@@ est@@ oring confidence also requires governments to give a clear commitment to sound public finances , fully respecting the Stability and Growth Pact .
As Mr Catania says , protection in human rights concerns must be integrated into border management , particularly in the mandate of Frontex .
Mr President , Prime Minister , regrettably it becomes clearer day by day that the present Constitutional Treaty will not be brought into force .
The only new requirement is that distributors , within the limits of their respective activities , are to safeguard and provide to the authorities on request the available documentation necessary for tr@@ acing the origin of products .
Finally , may I pay due thanks to the enormous and supportive work which I have been given not only by the secretariats , but by the tabling services .
The second issue I want to raise is a the decision which must be taken on the euro during the first few days of May of this year .
. Mr President , firstly , I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report which replies to the Commission &amp; apos ; s communication on Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union .
Furthermore , on behalf of the Council , I would like to thank the European Parliament for its excellent cooperation and its willingness to reach a compromise , which resulted in this agreement .
There must be much more stringent regulation concerning the laying of under@@ sea power and tele@@ communication cables or any foreign objects on the seabed where the lives of our fishermen might be endangered .
It would , however , provide rogue traders with more time to exploit the absence of effective cooperation between the enforcement authorities in the Member States .
That provision fully ensures a high level of consumer protection .
The Charter defines those rights and we hope that the convention will agree to insert the Charter fully into the Treaties .
In fact the contents of Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive , to which I would like to draw attention tonight , were a result of an amendment I made to the original draft proposal .
At the end of the year the Commission will issue a report on the national coexistence measures which will show what further steps need to be taken .
Therefore I would commend to the Commission the majority of my colleagues &amp; apos ; amendments which extend , clarify and develop the proposals of the Commission in a direction which is worthwhile and , in particular , the amendments which extend the provision of information through safety data sheets .
The service will also be responsible for the administration of delegations , though the people inside delegations will come , as now , from different services - not just the EEAS , but also the Commission services and maybe other institutions and bodies of the European Union .
Madam President , for my group this interinstitutional agreement is another building block in the re @-@ establishment establishment of the credibility of the European Union as regards how it hand@@ les fraud and financial mismanagement .
Mr Duff , the rule on when there are a large number of amendments in plenary and the President can ask a committee to look at it : it is not a referral back to committee of the report .
The EU is invited to the closed session of major stakeholders called by the Chair of the Kimberley Process at the margins of the meeting of the World Di@@ am@@ on@@ d Council on 14 July in S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg , where we will advance further discussions on that issue .
It is be@@ hol@@ den on the European Union to take seriously its responsibilities for Turkey and ensure that Turkey feels part of the European family .
Where I come from , there are many areas whereby they are being helped at the moment through existing funds , but there are other areas where we could do more .
There is no doubt that the accession of Cyprus to the Union will strengthen the influence of the European Union in the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East .
For instance , earlier this year , we created a high @-@ level level group on the social integration of ethnic minorities and their full participation in the labour market .
However , the Commission takes seriously the concerns reflected in today &amp; apos ; s debate and in Malaysia , as in many other countries , the fight against terrorism has at times impacted negatively on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
It should also be noted that the nature of these schemes shows a clear commitment to the protection of the environment , an issue which will figure strongly in the future development of both Irish and European agriculture .
After the Japanese tragedy , it is no longer possible to deal with the nuclear argument solely in terms of safety .
Therefore , we have been careful not to legiti@@ mi@@ ze a government which the countries in the region do not recognize as legitimate .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s reform strategy White Paper fulfils the undertakings readily given to Parliament and to the Council last year to give immediate attention to addressing the way in which the Institution , as an organisation , currently undertakes its duties .
The second issue which has given rise to a number of amendments is the desire to bring the Agency under the sole and direct responsibility of the Commission which would appoint the director .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , my group will offer its support to the European Commission .
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service .
Despite this , however , I intend to support the report , primarily because I completely endorse the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s view that visas should be not be required for individuals who hold residence permits in any state in the Union .
It will not be an easy task , when there is no agreement in the Union , whether to recognise the independence of Kosovo in corpor@@ e or not .
That is precisely what we are seeking to do .
I think it has highlighted the clear unanimity that we have when it comes to defending our values , but it has also highlighted some of the difficult choices and balancing acts that we have to engage in in the months and years ahead .
I just want to remind people that the budgetary authority in the Union is Parliament .
( The President asked the speaker to conclude )
By any reck@@ oning , this is a Europe of results , a Europe making a real difference on issues facing Europeans every day .
Mr President , I wish to make a personal statement .
I am convinced that the best way to deal with the problem of proliferation would be to abandon at@@ om@@ ic energy once and for all , as its civilian use bears great dangers on its own and , moreover , it cannot be excluded with sufficient certainty that civilian nuclear technology will not be used for military purposes .
As things stand at the moment they do not have that chance .
The cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in this field is exemplary and I am sure we will continue working on that basis .
On higher education , if we do not make progress quickly , then higher education and universities in Europe are really the eng@@ ine behind everything : the labour and financial markets and , finally , the coherence between macroeconomic policies and structural policies which have to be in place .
I was particularly struck by one issue that honourable Members talked about in a number of contributions and what , in a sense , has become very much more recognised in recent weeks and months but which nonetheless has been a concern to many honourable Members for a very long time : the concern about the way in which religious people , of all kinds of religion , are treated or discriminated against on a regular basis across the world and our need to be mindful and watchful of those issues , not when they become violent - when they become violent , in a sense , we are , of course , bound to act - but before they become violent , too , when this is a regular source of discrimination .
I do not see that this is proportionate to the issues and that the funds likely to be used in this venture would be better used elsewhere .
P@@ ast experience dictates that , as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer , we should , and indeed must , demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money , hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as &amp; quot ; value for money &amp; quot ; indicators in the grant @-@ giving giving process .
They will use every possible device of procedure and national constitutional law and timing to ensure that no referendums take place , or that they take place only in small countries when all the large countries have ratified .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - I think that , having a Czech presidency , you cannot expect us to stay silent .
An increase in the EU budget surely requires more justification than is shown .
In addition , the thematic strategy for sustainable urban development , being prepared under the framework of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme , will be a further step in enhancing dialogue between the Commission and national and local authorities .
On many accounts , the Commission is already in line with the calls of Parliament and is working on a number of outstanding issues identified in the report .
Those of us who have been here for a long time have seen many changes , not least in the relationship between Parliament and Council .
Therefore this motion for a resolution - along with the hearing in the Subcommittee on Human Rights next week - takes on an even greater significance because of the political and security situation in the area .
Let us , as responsible public representatives , try to present the truth to our people instead of trying to mis@@ lead them and exci@@ te them and frigh@@ ten them .
When it comes to adaptation , the Parliament is well on track , as it has already worked on its Rules of Procedure and has debated the installation of new institutions , such as the European External Service .
You may recall that Parliament put a very strong emphasis on the need for a positive outcome from this ICAO meeting .
After announcing the results , we - the Commission , the Council and Parliament - definitely need to review how to channel EU funds to strengthen the European Union &amp; apos ; s security of supply .
Of course , it is our moral duty to assist in the reconstruction of Gaza . Of course , it makes sense to seek safeguards from Israel .
I believe the EU has been playing its part in delivering that partnership .
There must be maximum cooperation between the EU Member State governments and all interested bodies so that a reduction in the use of CO2 becomes a reality .
In a paper on the EU security strategy in 2003 , Javier Solana outlined the importance and sensitivity of Europe &amp; apos ; s new neighbourhood .
Mr President , I should like to propose two changes to the original text .
Of course democracy and human rights should be encouraged in all the states of the world which are unfortunate enough not to enjoy them already .
What contingency plans are Member States making and what collective initiatives are taking place across the European Union in the event - God for@@ bid - of a serious problem associated with a major industry within the EU ?
However , the postponement of the decision on this accord at this point at the end of this Parliament would not , in my view , be in the long @-@ term term interest of the Mex@@ icans or of Europeans .
I wish to thank Mr Libicki , chairman of the Committee on Petitions , for his comments , and to assure him that I look forward to working closely with him in promoting the joint and common goals of the Ombudsman in that committee .
But it may be helpful to distinguish between two component parts of the overall European security and defence equation , the Petersberg tasks of peace @-@ keeping keeping and peace enforcement on the one hand and territorial defence on the other .
Not one that substitutes for committees like mine , but one that tackles issues that cut across Parliament &amp; apos ; s work , such as improving the regulatory agenda and acknowledging that we can sometimes be responsible for making life more difficult for European businesses .
Finally , I should like to refer to Amendment No 1 which stands in the name of my group .
The solution cannot simply be to attract health workers from developing countries , where the shortage is even greater .
Of course it is a major criminal threat , but so are drug smuggling , people trafficking and corruption .
That is what we need in the future , and I think it is an important message to give to you to give to the Presidency , because there will certainly be a huge discussion on 10 and 11 December when there is the next European Council .
I rise under the precedent of Rule 145 .
The Council has expressed its concern over this issue several times recently ; for example , on 15 February , over the suspension of the Parliamentary immunity of three members of the opposition ; and again on 19 August over the jail sentences imposed on members of the S@@ am Ra@@ ins@@ y Party .
The challenge is to establish an appropriate reform of the state aid policy in order to better contribute to innovation , sustainable growth , socio @-@ economic economic cohesion and environmental protection while avoiding excessive competition distortions .
In Community waters most of the time you target a particular species , but you have what is essentially a mixed fishery and that is much more complex to manage .
on behalf of the S &amp; amp ; D Group . - Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his contribution .
There was no violation , only a proposal by one parliamentarian ; there was no decision by parliament which could be blam@@ ed as a violation that happened .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I think this discussion on the ENPI has in fact already pre @-@ emp@@ ted emp@@ ted the next Commission communication on the Eastern Partnership .
We should also ensure that we invest to a greater extent in research and development policies and this is one area where the European Union has been lacking when compared to the US in recent times .
I need to make a comment to the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office which relates to what is going on with the Agricultural Council .
I should like to offer a quick comment on the points made by Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo , with a degree of eleg@@ ant nu@@ ance from both gentlemen , on the fact that it would be wise to take account of the results of the European Parliament elections in the nomination of the President of the Commission in future .
But I could summ@@ ari@@ ze it all by saying that public health , as enshrined in the Treaty and widened in the concept of application insofar as the Amsterdam Treaty is concerned , is a matter of great concern to the House .
in writing . - Whilst the EU is a global leader in the campaign against the death penalty , too many countries , including many with whom we have strong economic , social and cultural links , continue to execu@@ te people .
The existence of the bilateral investment agreements needs to be safeguarded but , at the same time , we cannot unconditionally b@@ less agreements if they create significant problems .
in writing . UKIP have abstained on Resolution on the principle that this is clearly a nation state matter and thus wholly inappropriate for the EU to interfere in or pass judgement upon .
That has been a priority of our committee and a priority of this Parliament .
We have an objective to create the most dynamic and competitive knowledge @-@ driven driven economy in the world .
Mr President , there is no disagreement on the fact that we want to comply with this piece of legislation .
While sympathetic , the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments as they are currently formulated and therefore I have to reserve my position on this question for the time being .
We need to execu@@ te it properly and in timely fashion .
Busin@@ esses , non @-@ governmental governmental organisations and Member States want new European rules , for example , to fight unfair competition , to protect the environment or to improve our legal systems .
That does not mean , of course , that there is no room for improvement : there is always room for improvement , and I look forward to this debate today and to an ongoing and active debate with Parliament .
It is noted that part of the convention is under EC competence and will therefore need to be signed and ratified by the EC .
Mr President , Parliament today will vote on its fifth resolution on Zimbabwe in the last 18 months .
On the EU side , the Council will be chaired by myself , my colleagues , Commissioners Piebalgs and Potočnik , and the Presidency , and on the US side by Secretary Clinton and Secretary Ch@@ u .
The next joint step should be to evaluate progress achieved by both regions with a view to preparing the ground for the opening of negotiations .
Mr President , I very much welcome the establishment of the second phase of Socrates and thank Mrs Pack for her excellent work .
The response should be to come forward with better conservation measures , perhaps a &amp; apos ; days @-@ at at @-@ sea sea &amp; apos ; policy which could be honoured by all fishermen throughout the Community , and not more proposals for decommissioning , particularly when our fishermen do not believe there is fair play in the implementation of the decommissioning schemes .
The Commission believes that the Council &amp; apos ; s general approach is a good starting point in our search for a good compromise .
It could have decided to ti@@ dy up the treaties in a simplifying document ; it could have given national parliaments a real say in EU legislation ; it could have looked more closely at what is done by national governments ; and clearly it could have set out an obligation for the Union to tackle fraud and maladministration .
I can fully subscribe to the arguments that have been put forward by Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten Ruijten .
I sincerely hope that the very helpful set of amendments proposed by the rapporteur on behalf of the committee will be taken on board .
Finally , the Commission stands ready to support Guatemala in monitoring the next electoral process and guaranteeing a transparent and democratic transfer of power - as it did for the last elections in 1999 .
In this regard , once the Treaty has entered into force , I consider it of utmost importance that Parliament be fully informed in advance of important decisions to be adopted by the Energy Community .
Indeed , over 18 months after the signing at Cotonou , we can now begin to assess the agreement by looking at the actual progress made in bringing it to life .
Mr President , I wish to point out that there are genuine concerns amongst trade unions in many Member States about the recent European Court judgment on the Laval issue .
Many years later , realities have changed : globalisation , together with the advancement in technology and the stronger political will , has made certain plans more do@@ able .
Finally , I would call upon all Members of this House to support these amendments and to get this regulation on the statute book as soon as possible so that we can put a proper contingency plan in place in the unfortunate event of an outbreak of avian influ@@ enza hitting Europe .
I hope that is so .
Mr President , I just wanted to say that according to my reason - if not to the Rules of Procedure - I am against the secret ballot and ask colleagues from my Group - or some of them at least - to withdraw their signatures .
However , when I look at how the political will has been lacking , how the corporate interests have inter@@ fered and how the WTO has pro@@ cras@@ tin@@ ated , what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission .
Do we create infrastructure so that they can come out of this problem ?
Madam President , on a point of order , I have here a report which appeared in the British newspaper The Independent concerning a meeting which appears to have taken place between yourself and Her Maj@@ esty Queen Elizabeth II .
The goal was to preserve as much continuity as possible and make as little change as is needed by the new treaty , but on the basic assumption of preserving the same level of flexibility and the same balance of powers between institutions .
We already have the Mitchell report , which contains the steps to be followed , and it has been accepted by both sides .
It means especially that we cannot continue to allow agriculture , accountable for only 2 % of our economy , to remain the stumbling block of these talks .
We must speak with one voice and be aware of the competition from cultural programmes by China and the United States , to name just two .
I believe there are alternative forms of parliamentary control that are more appropriate to the specific nature of Europol .
Our EU budget should be used produc@@ tively to develop the huge amount of creative energy around us into true wealth @-@ creating creating businesses , providing sustainable jobs and a prosperous and rich future for our people in Wales and beyond .
In the committee stage of this report part of a sentence was added which said : &amp; quot ; considers that the survey &amp; apos ; s findings should be taken as an opportunity to review national higher educational policies &amp; quot ; .
I therefore intend to launch a feasibility study on the criteria which could be used for managing the positive list and the resources which this would involve .
They underline the importance you attach to cohesion policy as well as your dedication to keep the policy at the heart of European integration .
The Commission will report next week on the implementation of the Charter but I can already now say that Member States &amp; apos ; progress in 2002 is encouraging , in particular in the areas of education for entrepreneurship and better regulation .
The answer can be bo@@ iled down to one sentence : the respect for the rule of international humanitarian law .
It was not always easy , not always without drama , but the political will has been un@@ f@@ lin@@ ching , our sense of direction is clear and significant results are there .
We are doing quite a lot with your help , but we can do a lot more .
I wonder if it might be possible for the Commissioner in his reply to dwell on the criticisms of under@@ spending sometimes level@@ led at the MEDA programme .
There was nothing quite so preposterous as to see this Parliament debating time after time reports on reports , especially , for example , the report that comes every year from the Committee on Institutional Affairs - usually with Mr Val@@ verde López as rapporteur - where Parliament receives the annual reports on European Union from the European Council .
As part of a possible response strategy , we will be looking at a number of important elements : stepping up the EU presence in Ju@@ ba by establishing an EU delegation ; initiating comprehensive political dialogue ; stabilising South Sudan and the joint border through specific measures and instruments - including the Common Security and Defence Policy and the Instrument for Stability - and increasing development assistance .
He will be receiving an invitation from me to a meeting next week where I have been asked by the Industry Committee to convene a group of interested parliamentarians .
Madam President , I wish to begin by apolog@@ ising to all my colleagues in this House for holding up the next speaker .
Food security to them means only food produced in the EU for Europeans .
I would like to ask you , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , what your position will be in D@@ j@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta at the A@@ sean Conference next week when the Council will be represented ?
We are for all kinds of debate , but let us be honest : we have institutions .
Perhaps Commissioner Brittan could pass on that particular question to the appropriate Commission service for an answer at a later date .
We must capitali@@ se on the major benefits of the current progress and ensure that we include the creation of a superior operational business environment for SMEs , including a more effective regulatory culture taking root across Europe .
If he is going to reply to this debate , Mr Solana might like to address that point .
Europe is its people , its history and now its collec@@ tivity ; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this : I will wag@@ er that when we ask the question - &amp; apos ; What is Europe ? &amp; apos ; - we answer it by saying , &amp; apos ; It is our art , it is our liter@@ ature and it is our heritage . &amp; apos ;
We are talking about setting aside part of our MEDA funds each year and allocating them to those countries which enter into specific partnerships with us to develop democracy and human rights .
I also welcome that he is clear that there have to be economic objectives and that has to reflect market needs .
If there are any ambi@@ gui@@ ties , we have made it very clear that he now has a fairly short time - just as you said , we are not thinking in terms of months but in terms of weeks - to clarify what these ambi@@ gui@@ ties are and what is necessary in order to clarify the European Union &amp; quot ; s position .
This Parliament should give its assent to this agreement in order that the European Union can play its part in that mom@@ ent@@ ous journey .
in writing . - While democratic progress in the Arab world should be encouraged , the strategic interests of the EU should not be endangered .
The proposals therefore allow the possibility of national aid for combined transport infrastructure for transfer facilities between modes and for specialized equipment for inter @-@ modal modal transport .
In this context , one of the things that the European Union can do is to express clear and simple demands for the release of all political prisoners , for the authorities to lift any threat of banning or restricting the Belarusian Helsinki Committee , and for quick movement towards the organisation of new elections .
The Commission has sent a policy option paper to Parliament in order to help build consensus in the Council , too , to ensure sufficient financing of low @-@ carbon carbon technologies .
Mr President , the European Council of Seville of 21 and 22 June 2002 fixed a certain number of priorities in the fight against illegal immigration , and revision of Regulation 5@@ 39 / 2001 on visas before the end of 2002 was definitely one of them .
How can the Council trust us and take us seriously if we are incapable of making coherent recommendations and produce urgencies which are inaccurate and contradictory ?
There is increasing acceptance amongst Arabs of the desirability of a negotiated solution , whilst Prime Minister Sharon himself has talked of the damage to Israel &amp; apos ; s economy and society caused by the continuing violence , and the im@@ possibility of permanent occupation and Israeli rule over four million Palestinians .
I am very happy with what the Commissioner has said .
I can accept your proposals to write into the body of the decision the limit of 90 % for the co @-@ funding funding of such NGOs , and we can justify this proposal because there are many particul@@ arities in these NGOs .
The vote will take place tomorrow , 12 March 2009 .
The European and Irish consumer , as well as the individual producers have a right to know if enhanced competition will result in higher energy costs for the consumer and , of course , the employees working in the industry have the right to know how it is going to affect their jobs .
This is mainly an ageing @-@ related related issue , but not simply an ageing @-@ related related issue .
The objectives agreed at Barcelona remain fundamentally valid and they are increasingly relevant : working together for peace and stability , creating shared prosperity through establishing free trade , providing the economic and financial assistance to meet the challenges which that implies , and helping to improve mutual understanding and tolerance among peoples of different cultures and different traditions .
There is no reference to that in the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal .
We have finalised all technical preparations and we have initi@@ alled the agreement . Now , it is pending a decision on signature from the Council .
Mr President , could I start my contribution by offering my congratulations to Commissioner Monti and his officials for the scrupulous and professional way in which they dealt with the proposed M@@ C@@ I Wor@@ ld@@ com - S@@ print merger .
This report highlights the complexity of establishing a forward programme for trade relations between the EU and the ACP , two very different and largely unequal groups which share a common goal to strengthen trade as a means of real development .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all , I am delighted that my very first official engagement since taking up office just some hours ago is here in the European Parliament .
Ministers of the eurozone Member States are also finalising the technical details of the European Stability Mechanism , which is due to take effect from 2013 as a permanent financial support mechanism to replace the European Financial Stability Facility .
In ten years &amp; apos ; time there will be fewer people - children and older people - suffering from as@@ th@@ ma caused by car fu@@ mes if the targets of this Au@@ to @-@ O@@ il O@@ il programme are met .
It secu@@ res jobs and ensures cooperation with the third world and the Mediterranean in particular .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , I shall begin by expressing how fully I share the concerns of this House about the recent violence against people belonging to religious minorities , as well as those who stand up for religious freedom .
This is just as much about creating equality of opportunity as removing the disparities between poorer and wealthier regions .
If not , then I fear this resolution , like all the previous ones , will end up in General Th@@ an Sh@@ we &amp; apos ; s du@@ stbin .
Mr von Wogau deserves much praise for drawing to a conclusion the lengthy negotiations that we have had on this important issue .
It is a question of how the European Parliament should be spending its time and be seen to be spending its time .
Furthermore I regret the proposed reduction to CFSP funding , especially in Kosovo .
We must not be p@@ om@@ p@@ ous , hypocritical or self @-@ serving serving about this .
Another point of discussion was the common asylum system .
A number of honourable Members have made clear the good and practical work done as a result of this regulation .
Let us hope these next few hours give a real chance for dialogue and trialogue between our three institutions .
The Commission must commit to producing an annual report on aid for trade to enable Parliament to scrutinise these funds and assure that they are truly additional .
Finally , I would like to congratulate Parliament on the broad consensus that has been expressed on the new methodology of the report on Fundamental Rights in the European Union , and express my wish that the approach which has been launched by Mr Cor@@ ni@@ l@@ let will be retained for the future .
Their presence and work is especially needed now that 10 new countries will join the Union and further enhance the number of existing minority languages .
It is fair to say that the US is our natural ally and , for that reason , I would dispute the statement made here this evening that the world is less secure as a result of American policy rather than more secure .
The Commission shares the view that its participation in meetings of the Council and all its bodies is part of the EU acquis and an essential element of the European Union institutional framework .
I join with other speakers in their positive response to the important work produced by the committee , chaired by Mr Jarzembowski , and to the excellent work of the rapporteur , Mr Ster@@ ck@@ x .
I think we all recognise the tremendous difficulty involved in coming forward with this report .
The European Union mechanism for civil protection is a relatively new instrument with limited resources , limited means and competences , but recent experience shows that it works : it is a real example of European Union added value .
There are some understandable national concerns but also some narrow , commercial interests wishing to dilute these measures .
Now in this country , four fif@@ ths of which - iron@@ ically - is Saharan des@@ ert , we have the catastrophe of flooding in Al@@ gi@@ ers with the death toll in fl@@ as@@ h floods rising towards 1 000 as the gri@@ m task of si@@ f@@ ting through the mu@@ d and the rub@@ ble goes on .
There is jurisdiction on judgments that are quite clear for some practices .
This House has dealt with the situation in Cuba on several occasions .
Firstly , it should send out a clear signal of our continuing political commitment to the enlargement process .
We are also serious in taking into account our relations with partners such as the United States , Canada and Australia .
It is a very important measure in a very important industry .
I hope that there will be an opportunity to come back to these issues in the Commission &amp; apos ; s 2001 Competitiveness Report , which will be presented in a few weeks &amp; apos ; time .
This is one of the most striking innovations on the Treaty &amp; apos ; s democratic agenda and one on which this Parliament has already worked in detail .
Mr President , although I support much of the wording of this resolution , I wonder whether we are best placed to lecture Belarus about the inadequacies of its democracy . We complain that Belarus has a weak rubber @-@ stamp stamp parliament , but look around you .
It is a source of great concern to the Commission that over 80 million people are at risk of poverty in today &amp; apos ; s European Union .
However , it is important to underline the fact that this is a policy which is based not on the legislative approach but on incentiv@@ ising , on facilitating and on creating the necessary tools in order to bring about more coordination , more cooperation and more stakeholder involvement .
I am pleased that the North Sea RAC has recognised that many elements of the Commission &amp; quot ; s proposal are valuable and appropriate .
The only thing I would say at this stage is that Europe will do whatever we can to continue to play this very constructive role and to try to build bridges between different points of view , while bearing our own priorities very much in mind .
If Lithuania continues to make progress and the European Union adju@@ sts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Lithuania should not be admitted to the Union .
rapporteur . - Madam President , if Members look at their e @-@ mails mails and all the requests from lobbyists and industry , and the pr@@ os and con@@ s on the climate , they can conclude that climate is very clearly back on the political agenda .
These matters call for coordination as we move forward with the development of Europe .
We are now studying experience gained in this area to identify the advantages and disadvantages involved in order to make a proposal to allow all Member States to use the same scheme .
These responses must be tailored to local needs but recognising that issues such as unemployment , deprivation and social exclusion are universal problems .
Mr President , honourable Members , dear friends of football and sport , I am very pleased to represent the Commission here tonight for the debate on football .
However , a note of caution : the idea that Member States should no longer have to cofinance projects with any of their own money seems a high @-@ risk risk policy .
An agreement at first reading on this proposal could not be reached between Council and Parliament for reasons mainly linked to the scope of the Regulation and to the publication of results .
Fu@@ ll harmonisation will apply to the areas for which the directive provides for such harmonisation , namely those areas most relevant to the operation of the single market .
In so doing , firstly , we would like some clarity about potential new obligations on foreign policy which could arise as a result of enlargement .
Im@@ possible quotas and restrictions are imposed in mixed fisheries , prohibited stocks are inevitably caught and in consequence they are dumped back - dead - into the sea . And all this while hunger prevails in many parts of the world .
in writing . - I am disappointed by the voting on this resolution .
I also urge all EU Member States to sign up to the Op@@ tional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the S@@ ale of Children , Child Pro@@ stitu@@ tion and Child Por@@ no@@ graphy .
I think it is the first report they have done in this Parliament and , I have to say , they have done a very good job , together with staff .
How do we do that ?
But I find it difficult to believe that any acceptable alternative view should not rest principally on UN mechanisms and procedures .
Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his helpful statement and for his recognition of the fragility of the salmon market and for the concern he expressed about the consequences of this disease for the hard @-@ pressed pressed fish @-@ farming farming industry , particularly in Scotland , where it is of vital economic importance to areas such as the Highlands and Islands where there is very little alternative employment .
The fundamental reason has to do with the debate which we had earlier today .
Whatever emerges , there is a duty on the EU to continue to press for reform in Romania &amp; quot ; s state residential institutions .
I understand the European Parliament &amp; quot ; s interest in creating a much stronger sense of urgency with regard to the question of its powers to supervise the Commission &amp; quot ; s exercise of its implementing powers .
Member of the Commission . It is somewhat premature to give details because if one starts going into detail now before discussions with the stakeholders , it could be somewhat alar@@ mist , as always happens in fisheries .
The Article 95 legal basis for this proposal , which fully eng@@ ages Parliament in the codecision procedure won my strong backing during the debates here , has received the full support of the Commission and Council &amp; apos ; s legal services .
If it were not for the common agricultural policy , that would have been very painful .
Freedom of speech , assembly and association are the building blocks on which all Western democracies rest .
A report on how we are working on this road map to tackle the financial turmoil consequences has been sent to the European Council for discussions in a few days in Brussels .
What does that tell us ?
It is our top priority and we must move heav@@ en and earth to make it happen .
Does the Swedish Presidency - representing the Council , of course - have specific ideas that they want to bring to the US @-@ EU EU Summit that will take place very shortly , in particular , about the differences there appear to be between France and Britain on one side and the rest of the European Union with regard to the financial regulations that would apply ?
I note with interest the proposals made in the resolution for the establishment of an &amp; apos ; EU &amp; apos ; seat .
The amendments submitted by the rapporteur and committee , but rejected , were heading in that direction and would have reached , in my opinion , a solution acceptable to everybody .
I do not know if Commissioner Kinnock is involved personally , but the Commission is involved in discussions in Geneva on this issue , working out what will precede harmonisation to establish standardised procedures for inland water@@ way vessels .
Mr President , as Chairman of the European Parliament observer mission to the December general election in Bangladesh , I wish to express my thanks to the presidency for allowing the mission to take place .
The European Union is fully committed to following this issue very closely .
Madam President , a point of order .
I know that Parliament will not want to send any equivoc@@ al messages about terrorism .
Therefore , we shall see , and I am sure that together , we shall come up with the best possible solution during this discussion .
This resolution is an important reminder of the fact that we need to continue the fight against the death penalty .
We will also ask for the principle of the rule of law to be the basis of the agreement .
rapporteur . - Mr President , as a result of the vote just cast , for the first time Parliament acqui@@ res the real right of control and veto over the norm@@ ative executive acts of the European Commission on an equal footing with the Council .
Over the weekend and on Monday night , the Council tried to offer a final compromise on an outstanding issue of votes in the European Council .
Yes to simplification , replacing 38 directives with UN regulations - as long as we are not seen as abdic@@ ating our right to legislate should we need to - and yes to the development of technologically driven solutions such as ECO@@ R .
The Council has to prepare a statement on the progress made by the EU since the report in 1995 by this Parliament on the NPT and , indeed , the many resolutions since then .
Then we have added on to that , in particular , other areas , such as the cross @-@ border border supervision of financial groups , about which we finally got some type of conclusions from the ECOFIN Council some months ago , and I have signalled what I am intending to do in the question of the &amp; apos ; origin@@ ate and distribute &amp; apos ; model .
In considering this legislation , would you bear in mind that a certain flexibility is certainly desirable ?
That is what we are talking about .
I would like to feel that at the same time we are looking at other issues which , because they are cher@@ ished in some Member State or in some particular group or community within the European Union , are sh@@ ru@@ gged aside .
There are , quite naturally , questions and hesi@@ tations . That is perfectly normal in issues of war and peace .
I also want to thank the Commissioner for her energetic promotion of consumer protection and the profile she is giving to this .
The second question is , how do you bring the large European cities and progressive regions into the game , internationally as well ?
In underlining that point I would ask the Members of the House to support this particular compromise resolution .
In this context , the Summit also produced a joint statement defining areas for further cooperation in the fight against terrorism , which is a clear priority for both sides .
As it happens , today in the Chamber we have guests from the Interim Tran@@ sitional National Council of Libya who met the Vice @-@ President President / High Representative last night but who cannot take part in the debate .
The Member States or their governments are keen to take credit for something that is going very well , but if something happens where they have to compromise , they will say it is the fault of Brussels .
If we do not organise the basic political conditions properly , it will be difficult for the Commission to play a meaningful , effective role .
Whether we like it or not , the Commission proposal , if carried , will allow experimentation with the very origin of human life and the destruction of human embr@@ yos .
I have a considerable understanding of how important this is for you as Members of the European Parliament because this is an extremely sensitive issue , where you are confronted with the expectations of your citizens , who are going to elect you in the next few months .
With regard to the oral questions , I think we are witnessing here a method of lobbying aimed at increasing pressure on the German authorities and cont@@ esti@@ ng EU safety requirements and regulations .
The Union cannot hide from the na@@ ked fact that the EU itself , together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , will have to play a key role in terms of financial contributions and technical support to make safe all these nuclear reactors sooner rather than later .
Today I should like to concentrate on presenting to Parliament the Commission &amp; quot ; s evaluation of the Council &amp; quot ; s first reading .
But also to put the positive case for enlargement , to win over sceptic public@@ s , and our group will support you in doing so .
The organisation was therefore not in a position to make its views known before a decision was taken .
Mr President , reference was made to me earlier by Mr Matsakis and I wanted to respond to it .
There have been some initiatives to decrease it , but the rate at which the gap is shrinking is much too slow .
I am sure that some points that were mostly to do with the budget are invitations to do more in future .
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank my colleague Mrs Peijs for her very hard work in trying to reach suitable compromises on such a controversial and difficult report .
I would like to congratulate Mr Le@@ ich@@ t@@ fri@@ ed for his fantastic work on this report and also to thank the Members of the TR@@ AN Committee who also contributed to this report .
These things do not happen easily , they do not happen overnight but they did work extremely hard and we are now seeing the fruits of the social dialogue in that particular sector .
Corpor@@ al punishment and the abhorrent condemnation to stoning , pron@@ ounced in the name of Sharia , have also been the cause of in @-@ depth depth debates with representatives of the Iranian Government , judiciary and cler@@ gy .
I must thank the Parliament for its continued strong support .
It is by improving the practices and methodology of the Union &amp; apos ; s Observation Missions that we can effectively contribute to strengthening democracy throughout the world .
As long as I hold my position in this House I will , of course , fight for unity between the North Atlantic democracies in promoting a common vision for the future .
Nor would we in this Chamber seek to deal with this issue in a pu@@ ris@@ t way : we recognise the links between education and other development goals ; that the fight against HIV / AIDS is crucial , given the 1@@ 000 teachers per year in Mozambique who die from that disease ; the trade liberalisation issues - regularly discussed in this Chamber - which lead directly to lost revenue to developing country governments , and cu@@ t@@ backs in education .
It is a joint responsibility to fight against terrorism and to protect the security of all our citizens .
In this context , the Council recalls that all EU Member States are party to the Montreal Convention for the Sup@@ pression of Un@@ lawful Ac@@ ts against the safety of Civili@@ an Aviation , which makes it an offence to endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight and requires states that have custody of offenders either to extradi@@ te the off@@ ender or submit the case for prosecution .
It is in our interests as well as in the interests of the people in the developing world .
I should like to press the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office on that point .
Europe is about rights for European citizens and I am very proud that this House is standing for those rights .
author . - Mr President , in Amendment 4 , contrary to the voting proposal , I suggest voting against , because of the agreement with Greek colleagues .
This is why I have tabled an amendment which has been agreed in the Employment Committee , to seek the publication by the Commission of guidance to accompany the directive to ensure the smooth and uniform transposition of this directive into law in all Member States .
It is worth noting , on the obligation to make checks at banks and bureau@@ x de change , that she encourages close cooperation between Member States , the European Central Bank , national central banks , Europol and , when established , Eurojust .
In terms of the resolution &amp; apos ; s reference to an ad hoc international tribunal , we should also recognise the need for Iraq to develop its own reformed judicial system within which perpetrators of crimes could be tried , and which could itself refer cases to the International Criminal Court .
Their implementation to national policies , together with continuing structural reform , will help improve the situation of vulnerable groups in the labour market , which include the young , the elderly , the long @-@ term term unemployed and people with low qualifications .
In a free society , if that is how people feel , they must be allowed to articul@@ ate their opinions .
Over the years , we have promoted the competitiveness of the sector by establishing a single European automobile market and calling for fairer competition in trade with third countries .
Madam President , I start by saying to you - and I hope you will convey this to the President - how much I enjoyed the initiative he took in inviting N@@ ob@@ el Prize winners here this afternoon and particularly hearing from distinguished scientists speaking to us in this Chamber .
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities , not in order to ev@@ ade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have .
The European Union &amp; quot ; s opinion and reaction will be based on this mission &amp; quot ; s report .
Our specific and concrete actions to ease the cong@@ ested and difficult traffic conditions in Eastern and Central Europe include the use of the PHARE funds to improve conditions at border crossings , to improve the training and development of personnel in customs services and , indeed , to encourage hauliers wherever possible to use the facilities offered by various governments to transit their lo@@ ads across countries - even at week@@ ends - on freight rail .
We must have clarification of the position of the WEU and the role it is going to take in the European defence identity , and that must happen in Cologne .
Could the Portuguese Presidency confirm that sufficient work has been done to ensure that agreement can be reached in December ?
In response more specifically to Mrs Lucas &amp; quot ; points , we share her concern about the slow progress in Council and we now hope that a common position will be agreed upon under the Irish presidency early in 2004 .
One of the most important issues which must be addressed with regard to the Irish tourism industry is how it will cope with the introduction of a single currency within the European Union .
The European Union is the largest donor - not only as a Union but as regards the Member States - with very low visibility .
I believe clean coal does have a future and I thank the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy for its report which at least starts this discussion going .
Mr President , if you have a market at European level - which we do , with the single European market - you of course need common rules for that common market so that it works fairly and efficiently , not least in the social field .
The proposal to trade quotas across borders is a new departure and one which will assist in the winding down of the sugar industry , especially in peripheral regions .
If others do not participate , it will not work , so part of the answer to what we have to do now is to be more active in the discussion from case to case - within groups of friends of Sierra Leone , to take one example - trying to organise a more coordinated response to moving away from the immediate crisis demands .
I want to add my congratulations to the Council for its success last week and to the Commission - Commissioners Verheugen and Dimas - for putting together a comprehensive package .
Mr President , I hesitate to phrase it in this way because it does not sound very modest as a Swe@@ de , but I think it is fair to say that the European Union and Europe will not be the same after this Presidency .
Do they want to be responsible for killing social dialogue at European Union level and these important steps to promote adaptability ?
Then you could bring in the political communities alongside the business communities , to work with the administrations to create this new transatlantic relationship .
The Irish presidency has proposed a compromise on this issue and the House needs to be aware that this compromise is completely unacceptable if the way Parliament voted is taken into account .
You referred to the Euratom regulations and directives a number of times , but the Euratom Treaty might as well be on the planet Zor@@ g for all the democratic control that we have on it in this Union .
We have already seen this on a number of different legislative fronts , both in the cooperation with Parliament and in the work with the Commission .
In the current climate there are serious questions over the EU &amp; apos ; s capacity to produce enough food to satisfy demand , and the implications of a similar outbreak here would be disastrous .
Pro@@ vocation leads to violence , which is met by violence , which leads to re@@ ven@@ ge and a sli@@ pper@@ y sl@@ ope away from a just and peaceful modu@@ s vivendi .
We hope that all the institutions will engage constructively in a process to secure what is an important directive for all of us .
With regard to the right to safe treatment and care , the fact that 10 % of hospitali@@ sations result in medical error ; the fact that we have hospital bu@@ gs such as M@@ R@@ SA and C@@ lo@@ stri@@ dium dif@@ fici@@ le ; the fact that we have too many need@@ les@@ tick injuries : these are all areas involving patient safety .
If he is , will he take into account the fact that these debates involve matters of urgency as well as fundamental principle ?
I was therefore very pleased that the European Council by consensus agreed to propose Mr Dur@@ ão Barroso as its nominee for President of the European Commission .
Thank you to the Czech Minister and congratulations through him to the leader and all the members of the Czech Senate .
I just want to ask the question as to why you decided to ask five questions from one Commissioner and only one question from another .
We are confident about making further progress in the coming weeks and we hope to finalise negotiations in the coming months .
But this is not the vital and fundamental issue .
If the EU is spending money in this area then it needs to be spent now in a better way .
As I have said very often , the most important problem we face in Europe today - which most likely we are going to face for some time yet - is unemployment .
Even though the first experiences from this procedure are positive , it is crucial to keep on building trust between institutions . The working relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission in this process are very important .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , we are , I hope , on the very last lap of the process of bringing the Treaty of Lisbon into force , completing a process which has taken eight years of discussions and negotiations .
Secondly , we hear a lot about needing this to fight terrorism .
Control@@ s of terrorist finance need joint efforts , but too much effort is focused on empowering the EU and extending its competence into new areas .
Mr President , today you will debate an important report by Mr Eurlings on the 2004 regular report and the recommendation of the European Commission on Turkey &amp; apos ; s progress towards accession .
We need protection of victims and the right to compensation ; but we also need a recognition of the rights of defendants if we are to live in a decent society .
