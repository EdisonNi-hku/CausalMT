I encourage the EU to diversify its energy package to avoid its dependence on one single natural gas provider .
- The Liberal Group today supported the amendment tabled by Jean Louis Bourlanges of the Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party , which called for the resolution to be separate from the explanatory statement .
That is particularly true , as a number of honourable Members have said , in Kosovo , where I have met the government .
These are all very positive things .
The statistics are quite staggering : 4@@ 2,@@ 000 deaths on the EU &amp; apos ; s roads every year , an estimated 1.@@ 7 million people injured to one degree or another .
It is entirely up to the Member States themselves to decide how high the tax is to be and of what it is to be composed .
Madam President , I am glad we are having this debate , even if it is on a Friday .
This hearing responds in part to the call in the draft resolution for an informative debate on the regulation .
We need to have the new legal framework operating as soon as possible , and I also hope that in parallel we could launch a common reflection about the line of demar@@ cation between the delegated powers and the implementing powers of the Commission .
The proposed directive provides not only for the protection of human health and the environment , but also preserves the Internal Market , as it would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community .
Human rights is important , particularly the situation of women .
The proposed directive would force too many Member States with already @-@ effective effective domestic measures to dismant@@ le them , as they would be incompatible with the directive .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Mr President , as Members have very clearly underlined , serious human rights violations are continuing in Burma .
Will the Lisbon Agenda at the Council in March reflect the energy and climate package ?
It is clear that the current and future competition for hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons resources does and will continue to affect the global security of supply and economic growth .
Mr President , I would also like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Fava , for his excellent work and his cooperation with us .
Regional cooperation to ensure that the region presents a unified market is also vital .
This is a core requirement for compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria , and the presidential and municip@@ al elections in March and April will therefore be a moment of truth .
I agree with you , and the Commission is aware of the complexity of these problems .
Even in the past when we have chosen the path of intergovernmentalism , in the Schengen agreement for instance , we have discovered that the very lack of instruments which surro@@ unded it has obliged it to start moving back to the Community method .
That I think is a major step forward .
While Eurobonds may be regarded as a cle@@ ver idea which can deliver funds to governments , there seems no legal base on which this can be achieved , so it looks unlikely that this option can be exercised .
I would therefore suggest that Member States should also consider funding that outside the context of the Seventh Framework Programme .
We should not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead , and I do not think this Parliament does .
I wish to begin by saying that the European Union adopted a strong and unified position during the talks and we would like to thank the Danish Presidency for its excellent work .
Please believe me when I say that I do not believe that the Irish people wish to deny the accession countries the opportunities and support that we as a small under @-@ developed developed country have experienced and put to great use over the last three decades .
I believe that we must direct more funding to these communities under the European Fisheries Fund post @-@ 2013 2013 .
They are in line with our ongoing discussions on simplification and better regulation , which represent a Commission strategy very high on the agenda .
That is why I am pleased that my amendment welcoming a new comprehensive anti @-@ discrimination discrimination directive was also accepted by the committee .
More needs to be done .
We need to reflect further before making such a proposal , which , frankly , risks being controversial .
Consumers will need to be assured , for instance , that once the ball of the single currency is in play , the double pricing in the euro and in the home money is the rule , not the exception .
Does the Minister agree that no matter how many years before Tibet rega@@ ins its freedom , no European state should recognise the illegal actions by the Chinese Government in Tibet and that the transfer of tens of thousands of non @-@ Tibetan Tibetan people into Am@@ do is illegal under international law ?
The development of energy technologies such as fusion and mi@@ x@@ tures of sustainable energy resources are essential .
This is not a minor point .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I too would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office and President Barroso for their present@@ ations here today .
I urge that this proposal be rejected so that companies , whether in hau@@ lage or public transport , can prosper .
In the &amp; apos ; European Consensus on Development &amp; apos ; - a document published in 2005 - employment and social cohesion are recognised as one of the nine areas of Community action .
Madam President , firstly I am rather surprised that our rapporteur Mr Cabrol has said that he is not supporting Amendments Nos 5 , 9 and 16 .
in writing . - The European Union has repeatedly expressed its commitment to freedom of religion , freedom of conscience and freedom of thought , and has stressed that governments have a duty to guarantee these freedoms all over the world .
We look to the Commission to provide such a rational basis .
That money has to be paid for some@@ time .
Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate those who have been responsible for getting the report to this stage .
And how are you monitoring that Member States are carrying out their duties under this code properly ?
The Commission will only consider its proposal after the two branches of the budgetary authority have adopted their positions .
This should be part of a communication or promotion by colleagues in the Commission and this House alike , because Europe tends to compare its potential with that of many other partners .
They should be imposing smart sanctions that hurt those people in power .
Earlier this year , the Commission presented a draft recast Financial Regulation .
But how often do we as politicians hear of the democratic deficit , and how often are we therefore urged to engage with citizens ?
In fact , further and fuller debate should be welcomed by all sides , because it would allow us to get rid of some of the mis@@ concep@@ tions with regard to what aspects of the Treaty we would be voting on in our countries , or debating in our national parliaments .
It is about involving schools and educational establishments across Europe , and giving them the opportunities to inter@@ link with one another .
We therefore support the thrust of the Co@@ zz@@ ol@@ ino report and most of its conclusions .
I think it is possible that this Parliament , during this term , will achieve a very strong consensus around a very ambitious set of proposals .
I warmly thank Mrs Car@@ rilho , my friend and colleague .
Moreover , there were considerable price differences between Member States .
On safer car fronts , I think it is worth pointing out how clearly the rapporteur has made the case for the Commissioner to come forward with a directive .
It is the Member State where that VAT is due that will determine the procedure to be followed in order to collect this VAT , including from non @-@ established established traders .
They say it will certainly make the EU more democratic , social and so on , but not enough so .
President of the Commission . - You are basically right in your analysis regarding the situation in the labour market .
The Commission and the European Defence Agency together have a key role to play in moving from a national to a European approach and in convergence between security and defence industries .
This will also be an important message from next week &amp; apos ; s meeting .
The reality is that it is a complex issue with formidable challenges .
But the other reason I res@@ ent the opportun@@ ist hypocrisy is this : those Members that complain about the current system are not obliged to take travel expenses .
Mr President , it is indeed good to hear the Council and the Commission restate so firmly the European Union commitment to rene@@ wing transatlantic cooperation .
If , as the companies producing them say , there are no health risks , why should we not have a mandatory health inde@@ m@@ n@@ ity ?
As you know , the European Union needs to implement this scheme fully because it is our international obligation under the N@@ EA@@ F Convention to do so .
I also submitted an amendment urging the Commission to lia@@ ise with the international Fair Trade movement in supporting clear and widely @-@ applicable applicable criteria against which consumer assurance schemes can be assessed , so as to support consumer confidence in such schemes .
Let us name and shame those Member States that are failing , and let us take action against them now .
However , we are not here today for rec@@ rimin@@ ations but for looking ahead .
We have to call for markets to be as transparent as possible , to function in a fully transparent way .
It is of great importance that information on the Member States &amp; apos ; accounts is comparable .
We have come a long way down the road .
They are there for the time in which the market is still being directly regulated , but this whole package envisages a time when the entire market will operate under normal competition aspects .
On the humanitarian aid side , we have moved quickly .
As a member of the committee on development , I would like to highlight the importance of progressing towards the Millennium Development Goals .
Mr van Velzen wants to make one suggestion , and that is on the division of competences within the Commission .
Mr President , this year , for the second year in succ@@ ession , the UN Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution calling on those states which still have the death penalty to impose a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty .
In terms of justice and home affairs I do not think we should be looking for a harmonised system across the European Union .
That is to say : every time you introduce a new rule you have to be able to say what the impact will be .
We also have to change our policy , and I will be discussing this later today with several MEPs responsible for this region within Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Foreign Affairs .
I am therefore pleased to announce that the Commission accepts all three amendments proposed by the European Parliament in the second reading .
It is justifiably a regulation because it simply re@@ moves certain sorts of bans on sales promo@@ tions while leaving it to the states to pursue their own particular legal , economic and political preference in other cases .
There are some preconditions which have to be met .
What we do not want to do with this legislation is to give one country &amp; apos ; s type of production an advantage over another country &amp; apos ; s type of production .
I take issue with the reference to fisheries being a sector in decline .
I would not like that public relations gesture to be made ; I want the Commission to know that there are at least some MEPs who thoroughly disagree with what is being proposed here .
That may give you some cause for concern .
It is difficult but it is possible , and the real test for our leadership is to make possible that which is necessary and I believe we can do it .
On action and energy , we have to fulfil existing agreements on energy liberalisation .
My questions to the Commission - and I know he will answer them in his usual gen@@ ial way - really relate to how this funding package will work .
Good luck Commissioner .
I am thinking of education , the poorest of the poor , the necessity for basic needs and basic services , and also of economic growth in the country .
Mr President , taxation is absolutely vital for the running of countries - I think most citizens would agree with that .
Therefore the amendment , as it has now been put forward , is regrettably unacceptable .
We are told today by the Council that safeguarding human rights is a priority for EU governments .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Madam President , I think it has been a very interesting debate and I am so glad that we have had the focus on an important region of the world .
We have a coherent strategy and we have made a remarkable amount of progress .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , we should never forget in this House that the freedom to debate and dissent that we so much enjoy in Europe is scarce and non @-@ existent existent in many parts of the world .
The British Conservatives support it , as does the PPE @-@ DE DE Group .
I assure you that if we discover that there is a real opportunity to finish before June , we will do so .
( Applause )
Mr President , I first of all wish to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency for a job well done .
Agenda 2000 through the CAP must be an integral part of the support required for rural economies .
All budgets are supposed to be mir@@ ror ima@@ ges of some economic policy considerations .
I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Lehne , not only for his efficiency and work in steering the Priv@@ ate Company Statute through the consultation procedure , but also for the interesting and creative solutions presented in the report .
You call us friends , and I say to you , on behalf of the European Parliament : We are at your side to create a Palestinian State that can live in safety ...
It is clearly a very thorough conference .
Does he share my considerable concern that Member States do not appear to be taking anything like seriously enough the fundamental principles that he has en@@ un@@ ci@@ ated and would he give us some indication that he will give positive vent to them at the forthcoming meetings ?
The new legal base , which was not really what we wanted , relies on the European Union &amp; apos ; s competence on health and it must not restrict the scope of the Daphne programme .
I am pointing out these things for this Parliament and for Commissioner Nielson to put at the back of their minds because much has already been said and will be said .
Mr President , this amendment to the directive is part of the process of tidying up the lo@@ ose ends not covered by the Au@@ to / O@@ il Programme .
The Council has noted that a further multilateral change of trade was the best way to meet the challenges posed by economic and technological change and increasing globalisation .
Last night in the Environment Committee , Members voted by 55 to 1 to back an ambitious negotiating position of the European Union in Copenhagen .
U@@ p@@ on reflection , however , the view preva@@ iled that the International Monetary Fund is , after all , financed to a significant degree by European money , so why should European countries not be able to draw upon its facilities ?
The cost of having to maintain parliamentary operations in both Strasbourg and Brussels has now become inde@@ fen@@ sible , and we will continue to campaign to have Parliament sit only in Brussels in future .
So we are talking about a global implementation report .
This is hardly compatible with the single market .
Finally , Mr President , it is true - several Members have pointed out - that we are lagging behind in the ratification process .
The structural funds have been very effective in poorer areas and peripheral regions in helping Ireland to reach the average standard of living of the richer regions of the Union .
In contrast to last month &amp; quot ; s debate on EU @-@ China China relations , his work and report have been a model of cooperation and consensus and my Group and I will be supporting his report .
Madam President , the problem of illegal immigration is a very complex one .
Parliament should be extremely grateful to both of them - especially the rapporteur for all the work that she put into this negotiation .
I am responding to this on my own behalf and that of my colleague , Commissioner Verheugen .
I sincerely hope , therefore , that you all agree that the case of Italy should be included in this report .
There are ten roll @-@ call call votes for this particular session .
Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for a thorough piece of work , a re@@ analysis of a proposal that Mrs Hed@@ k@@ vist Pe@@ ter@@ sen handled so cap@@ ably some months ago and in which I was also involved .
It is a very good report , and I would like to congratulate the honourable lady , without reservation , on what she has said .
Finally , on small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises , Mr Sie@@ k@@ ier@@ ski , it is very important that we are protecting our small businesses .
The report reminds us that in order to achieve significant improvement in global environmental protection measures and reduction of emissions , we need dialogue and consensus with both our trading competitors and developing countries alike .
This is not acceptable , as consumers should also have a right to obtain information on on @-@ going going investigations - provided that this information is not covered by professional secrecy in the manner that I described earlier and drawn narro@@ wly .
My question follows that one .
This Charter will be binding on the European institutions , and the whole field of Community law must respect those rights , failing which European legislation can be struck down in the courts .
Fourthly , a multilateral response will be crucial to address the risk of proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction .
Any food labelling policy must be accurate and depen@@ dable for both the producers and the consumers .
That was hard .
You have to encourage companies and businesses to create the jobs , to invest the money and to create the wealth .
But it is a significantly higher amount than that mentioned .
However the general opinion was that work should continue on enabling legislation that would enhance the mobility of companies in the European Union or facilitate company restructuring .
Madam President , Mr Barroso will have our support tomorrow , not only because you are nominated by all 27 Member States , Mr Barroso , and not only because we need to start work , but also because you have presented a broad political agenda that addresses the main challenges of our time .
While we may differ on the means of achieving this objective , I have no doubt that our aim is the same .
Or , does it mean that Poland and the British Government simply pay lip @-@ service service to those values but then deny their citizens the means to enforce their rights ?
Is it the understanding of the Commissioner that the UK and the Netherlands will now ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement ?
So while I would pay tribute to the efforts that have been made so far by the Council and the Commission , we have to say that more definitely needs to be done .
Let us not forget that either .
Since the beginning of my time in this Parliament , I have been involved in the case of the foreign language le@@ c@@ turers at Italian universities who had four judgments in their favour over 14 years and who are still not guaranteed or granted adequate rights of access to employment on the same terms as Italian nationals .
This is a long @-@ standing standing issue and it ar@@ ouses understandable emo@@ tions .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I should like to thank the Council Presidency for the progress that it is making in approaching an agreement at first reading .
Mr President , since there are many amendments , I do not propose to go through them all one by one , indicating the Commission &amp; apos ; s response .
We need to guarantee that the growing number of elderly people are fully able to participate in society because , between 2010 and 2030 , the number of EU citizens aged between 65 and 80 will rise by 40 % .
The flagship proposals in the Commission &amp; apos ; s Europe 2020 strategy are important tools to create that Europe , provided that we can make them come true .
However , when none of the exceptions to the regulation apply , the Commission may provide cop@@ ies of letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions .
That point has come to the fore in the part of the debate about safe third countries .
Finally , of course , it will create jobs .
Ad@@ dressing migration in a comprehensive manner also entails developing a structural approach and reinforcing the inclusion of migration in European external policies .
Mr President , I warmly welcome Mr Trakatellis &amp; quot ; s report .
We therefore have a big task if we are to reach the target of eliminating the disease by 2050 .
We feel strongly that a real initiative to prevent injury and promote safety is so important that it needs to be put on its own stream within the health programmes .
In the remaining three weeks of the Luxembourg presidency , for all its skil@@ ful diplomacy I would be surprised if this were to be part of any package , if indeed the Council has a position .
It is a refre@@ shing and stimulating report with a lot of insight and proposals .
In other words , to turn this crisis into an opportunity , and to the benefit of us all in the long term .
The citizens can never fully believe in the European Union unless Community law is respected at all levels of the Union .
For me , what Copenhagen showed was that we had to express a European interest in the various areas and defend it consistently and strategically , with all our partners .
These are consultative @-@ only only as far as Parliament is concerned .
I was inc@@ ens@@ ed when , as late as yesterday , the Commission could not advise us as to exactly what would be involved in &amp; apos ; category &amp; apos ; .
One should not underestimate the extent of this problem .
I have noted all the comments made by all the parliamentarians who have spoken on this subject .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
Once again , I would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee .
The report commends the opening of the active phase of negotiations and the completion of the first chapter of science and technology as well as the resumption of legislative change in Turkey through the n@@ in@@ th package of legislative reform .
The result is that consumers are being denied choice and more competitive offers , and competitive businesses are being denied opportunities to access new markets .
They will not come into play when this proposal becomes reality .
Nevertheless , as my colleague , Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions , when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately , different considerations must be taken into account .
So that is still a common phenomenon and I think we have to work on that .
I therefore voted in favour of the Angelilli report today .
Any amendments to the code must enjoy the support of all Member States .
Therefore I should like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on a very thorough and comprehensive report and I should also like to thank the other committees for contributing to it .
I would also be in favour of close and continuous contacts between this new contact group and both the European Parliament and the Congress of the United States .
As I have already indicated , part of the reason I was very pleased to be able to participate in this debate is that this has been raised once before with the Foreign Affairs Council - but we will come back to it at the end of January - and the concerns that honourable Members have made have reson@@ ated and echoed with the concerns which have been raised with me from a variety of different sources , not least from some of the Member States and some of the ministers who have been most concerned about these issues .
I think it is a very important area .
I know , rapporteur , that some people want to go back to the common position .
The quality of our European workforce will be the single most important factor in determining our future competitiveness and therefore our future prosperity .
I believe that the proposed European Parliament resolution could be one of the elements to help such a political solution .
But I want to express my deep concerns about certain phra@@ ses in the resolution , which refer positively to the &amp; apos ; Stockholm Programme &amp; apos ; , the &amp; apos ; EIDHR &amp; apos ; and to the European Union as a &amp; apos ; Global Player &amp; apos ; .
A more important focus is bringing fishing opportunities into better balance with available stocks for a more sustainable future .
( H@@ U ) Mr President , we should not emb@@ ell@@ ish things .
Firstly , her report aims to harmonise social policy across the EU rather than leave the detail to Member States - a point made with great force by Mr O@@ lle Schmidt earlier in this debate .
Madam President , let me briefly address three questions .
Iran must live up to its international obligations and treat detained persons in accordance with international human rights standards .
It will take years to fully succeed , but together we can - and indeed we must - make a lasting and tangible difference so that all Europeans have a chance of living in good health .
So far , only seven have done so , Parliament urges the remaining 18 Member States to ratify as soon as possible .
I look forward to the participation of Malta and other applicant countries in the Europe of the new millennium .
Much work has been completed with Member States &amp; apos ; experts and with wider stakeholders to turn the network into a successfully functioning reality .
Mr President , my committee welcomes Mr Agnoletto &amp; quot ; s report which , with very few reservations , we fully support .
It has been the arch@@ et@@ yp@@ e of the BSE crisis .
Under Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure , I am asking the Members of the House to postpone the vote on the Onesta report with regard to the petitions process , as this matter is at present being dealt with in the Conference of Presidents in the context of the reform of the procedures of the House .
During the negotiations , however , you should insist that the undertakings made in the current agreement be implemented without delay , because assessments have shown that even if there is an agreement it is not being fully and correctly implemented .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like to thank Parliament for its interest in the Arctic and also say how much we appreciated your resolution on Arctic governance last October .
I have already tabled a written question to the Commission on this topic , but would like to take this opportunity to put that question again . So , Commissioner , could you please tell us whether the Commission thinks this is only a matter for national governments , or do we need European action in this field ?
Legal matters aside , the petition on which the report is based raises some important points .
I should like to welcome the Minister to this part @-@ session session here in Brussels , rather than in Strasbourg , and say how much I look forward to seeing the French presidency at future part @-@ sessions sessions here in Brussels , rather than in Strasbourg .
Within the next couple of months I will inform Members of how I intend to proceed on these important issues .
Members of the Environment Committee clearly cannot be aware of the undue delays that any non @-@ approval approval of Structural Funds programmes would create , nor indeed of the new budgetary procedure that could involve not only delays but the loss of millions in funds in the case of the UK to Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , South Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , the High@@ lands and Islands , Northern Ireland , Cor@@ n@@ wall and the Is@@ le of W@@ ight . These are vital life @-@ line line funds for jobs and growth .
Madam President , the results of the European Council could be seen as politically and institutionally satisfactory , but the message from today &amp; apos ; s debate is that the crisis is not over .
The numerous amendments presented by my group and by others correct these flaws , and the current text is a balanced one .
Mr President , according to the Lisbon Strategy , we have to build a welfare state all around the European Union that has to be a model in our globalised world .
Honourable Members will however be aware that of course several Member States do not share our joint enthusiasm and there is much work to be done independently of the negotiations on the staff statute .
It is a proud bo@@ ast of many Europeans that we are free to do anything which is not expre@@ ssly prohibited in law .
Thirdly , remembering recent history I wholeheartedly hope that Croatia &amp; apos ; s successes are the first steps for membership for the whole region of the Western Balkans .
That had no precedent ever in European law making .
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative .
We must set common rules guaranteeing a high level of environmental protection for all facilities in the European waste recovery market .
That is why we have a European Parliament , so that Europe is not just left to government ministers and tech@@ no@@ c@@ rats , diplomats and bureaucrats .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Madam President , can I first of all thank Mr Davies very much indeed for all the work that he has put into this report , and for his extremely constructive cooperation .
I am very grateful in general for the work of this Parliament and its support on human rights issues .
I regret that we cannot give you a more complete answer at this stage .
Up to now it has been done indirectly via the political groups in the European Parliament , hen@@ ce@@ forth it will be done directly according to clear criteria and clear procedures set out in this legislation .
I would ask you to take into consideration that literally over a hundred colleagues missed those two votes , as they were scheduled first today and there were no further roll @-@ call call votes .
Furthermore , the Commission has proposed new measures on these new substances in its White Paper on the new chemicals policy and we are now working on concrete proposals with my colleague , Mrs Wallström .
It is only through this flexible , forward @-@ looking looking and , above all , inclusive approach that Europe will be able to meet the economic and social challenges of the new millennium .
I thank the European Parliament for its support so far and hope you will continue to support the Commission in further developing the European dimension of n@@ an@@ osci@@ ence and research .
I am in favour of such a tax , but I believe it needs to be at the global level , rather than European level , in order to be effective .
The radicalisation of Egyptian politics would be a disaster for that country and for neighbouring Israel .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , two weeks after our last debate on measures against the financial crisis , I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you further actions which were jointly taken to face this challenge .
I would like to make two particular points which arise from this .
On the Middle East , we welcome the declaration made by the European Council .
I should add that all the emphasis that we , as Europeans , place on the need for increased legitimacy and transparency in the WTO will come to nothing if we do not reform the way in which we conduct our own trade policy in the European Union .
The substantive amendments are not really the issue today .
So far , resolutions and sanctions appear to have been ineffective .
This is also reflected in the Council compromise text .
However , I should stress at this stage that the agreement reached on 5 April at the Transport Council represents a delicate balance and a delicate compromise , so that there is limited room for further changes in light of the decisions reached at that stage .
The only way we can do that is through rules and through international cooperation .
A lot has to be done in this area and FYROM must demonstrate that it can live up to international standards by respecting minority rights and show that its democratic structures are stable enough for it to pursue its path towards European integration - in simple terms , to become a member of the European family .
This proposal is currently under negotiation and discussion in the Council .
It is good that we have that message to take back to Member States which are not doing this and to those which have long waiting lists .
On the general context of the EURO@@ ME@@ D process , I should like to begin by stating that I believe that this partnership is of the highest priority to the Council .
I therefore fully endorse the idea of creating a European taskforce which would be coordinated by the Commission and in which Parliament would be represented .
However , I should mention that the Commission has already begun a debate , as requested in Amendment 4 , with the regional advisory councils concerning the implementation of maximum sustainable yield management and has also already arranged for the impact assessment foreseen in Amendment 5 .
We hope to see a strong commitment from the Council as well .
Obviously our group agrees with this .
Our role is , therefore , to flan@@ k the WTO with other supporting agreements in other fields , notably the environmental field .
On the one hand , being a global partner , we see Russia as a real partner , as I said before .
And , yes , where we can use them as a labor@@ atory , for example , for the development of renewable energies , we should certainly try and promote and encourage that at the same time , seeing to it that their vulner@@ abilities are not prejudi@@ ced in any way .
It is very important that this day should not go by without our acknowledging this initiative .
The report he has produced by and large reflects the conclusions of that committee .
However , we have decided to vote in favour as there are a lot of positive elements in the report , particularly its emphasis on renewable energy , which is clean , cost @-@ effective effective and secure .
I fully share the concern that the flow of information provided to the European Parliament should be as complete as possible .
Many aspects of the Treaty are of fundamental interest to you , to the European Parliament and - as we are talking about foreign and security policy - on that particular issue .
If we regard these issues as merely domestic , as has been reflected in national legislation on many issues regarding the family , then we do ourselves and the people of Europe a gross injustice .
The Commission has also made a declaration on this .
The Commission also undertakes internal analysis to ensure the effectiveness of its work .
Secondly , the honourable Member is entirely correct that the effectiveness of any sanctions - and certainly of travel bans - is entirely dependent on the extent to which Member States implement those sanctions .
We vote against in protest at the whole system of tobacco subsidies .
Madam President , I wish to raise a matter which is not , but should be , on this week &amp; apos ; s agenda - the foot @-@ and and @-@ mouth mouth disease crisis in Europe .
I fully share your views on the need for a fact @-@ based based public debate on EU accession .
I will indicate when the oral amendment applies .
Genu@@ ine freedom of religion is often the tou@@ ch@@ stone of a country &amp; apos ; s abiding commitment to human rights .
I believe both of those are important aspects .
As such we should seek a common European solution .
To Mr van den Berg , I would say that development policy is and will remain a key component of European Union policies and an important asset for Europe in the world and in the context of the Constitution .
Unless we are careful we will see a very dangerous discrep@@ ancy develop between what is decided amongst the great and the good and what needs to be encouraged and explained to the electorate .
The Court has now clarified that position .
With regard to the medium and long term - i.e. the post @-@ 2007 2007 review - we very much hope that by then the clause will have been adopted , that Parliament will have secured codecision and that everything will be dealt with as part of a proper democratic procedure .
A solid legal framework is therefore essential .
I share the view of the rapporteur that what is needed are concrete proposals for firm action .
in writing . - Although the vote was secret , I have no problem in acknowledging that , as La@@ zar@@ os Stav@@ ro@@ u La@@ zar@@ ou fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 2@@ 86 ( 1 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU , we have delivered a favourable opinion on his nomination as a Member of the Court of Auditors .
We say we are united in diversity , so let us cooperate .
Commissioner , thank you for that comprehensive answer .
The work of the institutions has been impressive , given that there are 27 EU Member States , including 16 euro members .
That is why the EU needs real reform .
For effective monitoring and control , there must adequate budgetary and human resources .
These emergency situations have been handled through policies that were jointly developed by the EU , the IMF , the ECB and the governments of the Member States concerned .
To conclude , ladies and gentlemen , I wish once again to thank Madam Redondo and the Agriculture Committee for the excellent report and their support .
Let me say a word about Kosovo .
I would like to say at the outset that we share many of the views expressed in your motion for a resolution and welcome the support of the European Parliament for the strengthening of transatlantic relations .
I think Mr Kal@@ las is doing a very good job .
Mr President , we need to support innovations and research all over Europe .
However , that number does not correspond to an increase in innovative activity , therefore giving us cause for concern over an extension of the scope of Patent Office subject matter .
Here we will focus on how to cooperate further and more closely on the Middle East peace process , on the challenges posed by the nuclear ambitions of Iran , and on ways in which we can assure the renewal of the comp@@ act in Afghanistan , which is at the basis of our concerted efforts there .
- That concludes the explanations of vote .
But it is - as the Council also said - a very important part of the negotiation .
We are delighted that Commissioner Monti has made progress in this area .
Mr President , I would like to make it clear that I supported draft Amendments 7@@ 32 and 7@@ 33 and it is a pity that this House did not support them .
There is massive repression of journalists and campaig@@ ners for justice , for communities and for workers .
Ladies and gentlemen , in concluding this brief address , allow me to congratulate Mr Ferber and the rapporteurs of all the political groups involved , i.e. the shadow rapporteurs , on their contributions to our fruitful and constructive discussions .
I am ready to come any time to any committee in Parliament to discuss those issues .
Mr President , the substance of our oral amendment would mean that what we were asking for effectively is that the results of the earlier elections stand and be implemented . &amp; apos ; Without delay &amp; apos ; changes the meaning of what we are attempting .
On that basis , I do not support the cap@@ ping of payments to large farms .
That is a vi@@ le mis@@ representation .
After the prolonged talks in the United Nations Security Council failed , the European Union was bound to steer the process to a conclusion .
For political , economic , social and legitimacy reasons , cohesion policy must not be divisive : it should be a policy for all , as the internal market is , as the common currency is .
Amendment 9@@ 89 : + EUR 1 million on line 16 03 02 , commitment appropriations , and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations ;
This procedure , which has no parallel in the Member States , is an example of democracy in action at the heart of the European institutions .
Thank you very much for your speech today as well .
Mr President , there is enormous discrimination against women in the United Kingdom , sadly .
However , I am bound to say in respect of the issues under review to do with fraud , corruption and mismanagement that tonight &amp; apos ; s contribution fell short of being a t@@ our de force .
The second point which I want to mention is that this budget falls under the shadow of the Court of Auditors &amp; apos ; report .
The reality of this competition must give urgency as well as direction to the development and implementation of policies at European level .
We will give you our support , and we will scrutinise the proposals , and we will discuss with you , because we have confidence in democracy and the majority we have in this Parliament .
I am deeply conscious of the consistent support of Parliament across a range of issues on our agenda .
Mr President , this is not really a point of order .
Therefore , let us not always put the blame on the European Union or the European in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions .
The OSCE is rapidly usur@@ ping the Council of Europe as the principal and most relevant forum for discussing democracy - with its ODIHR branch supporting election monitoring - human rights and the rule of law in Europe .
This report highlights a number of critical areas where we have failed .
In particular , no European Union Member State should provide sanc@@ tu@@ ary for terrorists so they can mo@@ unt attacks on another state .
That is why the Commission will present a White Paper , accompanied by an impact assessment , for further discussion around the New Year .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Mr President , this debate clearly confirms that both energy and innovation are absolutely crucial for the future of Europe and the future of the European economy .
The determination of the candidate countries to overcome these problems and work positively has resulted in incredible progress .
The situation is no longer sustainable .
Secondly , all of us have the task in the next few years of convincing public opinion of what I have just said .
The Greek Government is right to guarantee that the social partners in Europe will be involved intrin@@ sically in the process of labour market reform .
There are already reports on the first steps taken .
It is important that the existing nuclear power plants are managed in as safe and secure a way as possible , but it is also important that we have clear rules to ensure that the future power plants of the European Union are as secure and safe as possible .
Mr President , on a point of order , some of us have been waiting here since 7 p.m. - the time now is 9.@@ 40 p.m. - just to get a chance to speak in the one @-@ minute minute speeches .
As regards the balance between political criteria and transposition of the acquis communautaire , the Commission has already increased the allocations for projects in the area of the political criteria in IPA 2008 in all countries , and will continue to do so gradually .
Finally , Commissioner , it is high time to talk about energy security and think about the Transatlantic Energy Council for the future .
If this information was to be shared across the EU , many third countries would refuse to sign similar agreements in the future .
It is imperative that the newly emerging political map of Europe , with its pla@@ gue of un@@ healthy nationalism , does not threaten Romania &amp; apos ; s entry into the European Union .
This also helps because the report has made the facts clear .
This is the only way to find an honourable and lasting peace which is so desired by the populations of the region and by the wider world .
The rapporteur &amp; apos ; s suggestion that new links should be formed with the near @-@ mor@@ ib@@ und mor@@ ib@@ und Economic Policy Committee set up in 197@@ 4 is good , as too is the proposal that dialogue should be encouraged between the EF@@ C and the Employment Committee created under the employment chapter of the Amsterdam Treaty .
That is why I am surprised by the reluctance shown by the Council and by some colleagues in the European Parliament .
The main aspects of this entail strengthening regional integration through support to ECOWAS , reinforcing coordination with the UN and enhancing national and regional political dialogue .
When push comes to sho@@ ve , at a time of crisis , who is going to be the one voice representing Europe ?
In particular , I endorse the proposal that Europol should be given precisely defined operational and executive powers determining which national police bodies are to be responsible for all the measures carried out in their countries .
I should like to mention that the Ombudsman has recently recognised , in the precise context of the ACTA negotiations , that it was justified to maintain the confidentiality of some key negotiating documents .
We need to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium @-@ sized sized companies to conduct cross @-@ border border business .
We need to ensure that the impact of any future directive fur@@ thers rather than frag@@ ments the internal market as Member States interpret , implement or enforce such a directive to fit in with their own different national approaches .
I also want to say that Parliament does need to do something in relation to our records when there are Members of Parliament who have been here for over four and a half years , who have drawn a salary for all of that time , and who have spoken for less time than Mr Bur@@ ke , who has been in the Parliament for six months .
Mr President , have all EU Member States been consistent in the political message delivered to Iran to back the efforts of the EU three and Mr Solana on the nuclear file by living up to the imposition of the economic sanctions ?
in writing . - I voted in favour of Mar@@ ía Mu@@ ñ@@ iz De Ur@@ qui@@ za &amp; apos ; s report on the EU as a global actor and its role in multilateral organisations .
Looking at the result , it seems to me to be in many ways one step forward and two back .
Com@@ promises have been reached .
I also want to thank him for his very strong engagement with the work of this committee in Parliament - it has been very much appreciated .
There has been a lot of talk in this debate about the legal and administrative obstacles to local employment in the Member States .
Mr President , I would like to compliment you on the way you handled catch @-@ the the @-@ eye eye today .
I will be more than happy to appear before the committee in November .
The same applies to trying to secure a much improved gender balance .
My party and my country are pro @-@ Europe Europe on the whole .
In other words it is not terribly satisfactory but at least it is better than the original proposal from the Commission , and the amendment by the Socialist Group which I hope will not be supported tomorrow .
Mr President , the Commissioner was about to tell us whether or not the Commission believed that a total ban was going to be Commission policy or not and then , certainly as far as the interpreting was concerned , I never heard the answer to that question .
Thanks are also due to all the other colleagues , from several groups , and other people involved in the report , especially the members of the various NGOs for the normalisation of languages who were in contact with us during the preparation of the report .
I can accept Amendment 2 and Amendment 7 with , however , some small drafting changes .
You have pre@@ sided over one of the most extraordinary periods in the history of the European Union and the life of this Parliament , as you yourself said in your speech : going from the intergovernmental conference , through the introduction of the euro and indeed through the unexpected ratification process of the new Commission - that though we had not quite timet@@ abled or expected it - has also been dealt with .
It is pretty much accepted that the carbon emissions in relation to aviation are currently a very small proportion of the overall carbon emissions of the EU .
The EU is also pressing for mor@@ atori@@ a to be introduced where relevant .
However , the Liberal Democrats in this House insist that anti @-@ terrorism terrorism measures must always respect fundamental rights and be subject to proper democratic oversight and control .
Not least , given our commitment to transparency and accountability , this will enhance good governance and , in an ideal world , it will increase trust between those who spend and those who provide .
We are at an important point in our relations here .
We must also insist on periodic scientific reviews .
I should like to finish by saying a few words on the way forward .
Concerning the corresponding measures and the budgetary procedures , we are sure that the commitment of the European Parliament which has raised the visibility of the issue of access to medicines will help to increase their efficiency .
Thank you for that very full reply , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office .
We are grateful for the support of the European Parliament in these efforts .
The drive to make Europe more competitive does not begin and end with summit conclusions .
In addition it has to be linked with policies that help poor countries to develop , through agriculture in particular .
What is the Commission planning to do to indu@@ ce Sweden , in line with its Treaty obligations , finally to introduce the euro ?
The priorities for the European Community &amp; apos ; s co @-@ operation operation with An@@ gol@@ a are sp@@ elt out in the recently signed Coun@@ try Strategy Paper .
I would like , in particular , to congratulate Mr Böge , Mr Lewandowski , Mr Mulder and Mr Walter for their remarkable job , which I know was done under very difficult conditions .
A global and comprehensive legal agreement remains the only effective way to reach the agreed objective of staying below a 2 ° C increase in global temper@@ atures .
In response to the specific question asked by Mr Pal@@ ec@@ kis , the Commission points out that the purpose of the minimum rates is to limit distortions of the internal market through different tax levels being set by Member States .
Mr President , it appears that , as time goes by , the European Union is becoming more and more in@@ effec@@ tual where certain dictatorships are concerned .
There are still substantial problems with this draft regulation and the Council and the Commission are working very hard to resolve the issue .
But the Commission understands the concerns that this might lead to a situation where too many products are classified as prescription @-@ only only medicines because of a &amp; apos ; lowest common den@@ omin@@ ator &amp; apos ; effect among the Member States .
Among other things , it is foreign debt or excessive external imbalances on which markets have focused , and this clearly means that in responding to the situation , we must go beyond fiscal adjustment .
I delivered this message with great clarity to the con@@ gress of my political party , the Party of European Socialists , last week meeting in Malm@@ ö and , in particular , to the nine prime ministers within the Council who are from our political family and who were all present in Malm@@ ö .
It is extremely important to this Parliament that the Commission takes these concerns very seriously and that we do not have the sense of dis@@ connect that we had , for example , with the SWIFT agreement .
Our group has asked for the postponement of the vote as the Court decision on the above opinion of the Ad@@ vo@@ cates General is due already on 8 March and Parliament should be fully aware of the legal consequences of the &amp; apos ; enhanced cooperation &amp; apos ; before embarking on such an exceptional project .
Mr Evans would like the Commission to ex@@ h@@ ort other Member States to follow the British example or the Swedish example .
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs .
The harmonised objective of regular , comprehensive and detailed statistics is needed in order to monitor the process of the implementation of tasks .
Kosovo &amp; quot ; s Pro@@ vision@@ al Institutions of Sel@@ f @-@ Government Government must demonstrate their commitment to a multi @-@ ethnic ethnic Kosovo .
Your vision is needed as we face the difficult challenges ahead .
Therefore , it is important that this law be clarified and streamlined .
However , especially in the light of Member States &amp; apos ; call for simplification , it would prove difficult to convince them of additional reporting burdens .
Firstly , on political party funding - the matter just raised by Mr van D@@ am - my Group considers that this funding should be in Parliament &amp; apos ; s , not the Commission &amp; apos ; s budget .
Whatever the faults - and it is our responsibility to try to put them right - let me pay tribute to what has been achieved and is being achieved by European Union aid and by the generous support of Europe &amp; apos ; s taxpayers .
I would suggest respectfully that the honourable Member is trying to temp@@ t me into discussions as to the approaches or suggested approaches of one Member State or another , when my responsibility today is to speak on behalf of the Council .
And this is understandable .
How many weeks must we wait for consensus in the Council , and when we reach consensus , for the courage to carry it through ?
I believe , therefore , that when you come to this Parliament next month , we would like to hear some clear idea of the direction you will take on two fronts .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the Commissioner is telling us that the Mem@@ orandum of Under@@ standing was drawn up under Article 122 , part 2 .
I thank the Commissioner for her work in this area .
Mr President , we would like to suggest an oral amendment to take out the word &amp; apos ; NATO &amp; quot ; , which we thought we had taken out in the negotiations anyway .
I wish to underline again that the valuable efforts made by the European Parliament and in particular by the rapporteur , Mr Zappalà , and the shadow rapporteurs have been essential for the successful outcome of this negotiation and the final adoption of this important proposal .
A successful transition will benefit us all .
There are two further points from that text which I would like to emphasise .
This is for later , after proper debate .
The Greek Cypriots should tell us their ideas to ensure that enlargement is completed and the rest of the European Union must assist and remind them that this business cannot remain un@@ finished .
It is also vitally important that developing countries be allowed fair access to the world market place within the WTO , thus helping them to achieve their ultimate goal which is the eradication of misery and poverty in these regions .
It was recognised that people too have rights , not just the states in which they live .
First of all , I sympathise with the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s desire to get better implementation of European Union law .
The EU can only achieve its objective by being active and organised on the world stage , and this is particularly true of migration .
In addition , the Council is currently examining a new Commission proposal that aims to extend the protection against discrimination even further .
So I welcome this legislation and consider it important that industry in my country and perhaps countries elsewhere should recognise that if it does not seize the opportunity to modernise its processes and live up to the high environmental standards then it will lose out on market opportunities across Europe .
Member States must understand that this is an area in which citizens want more Europe .
I am looking forward very keenly to working with him .
T@@ w@@ enty @-@ six six of the twenty @-@ seven seven Member States of the European Union will ratify or have ratified it , and that includes the British Parliament .
I hope Parliament will be able to restore these cuts , but how can these be priorities when the Council is not following through on the financial commitments ?
Let us show solidarity in real terms .
It is our priority to make progress with Tunisia in that area , for example , by actively promoting human rights activists and civil society organisations under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights .
Does he agree with me that we need to have a Council of Defence Ministers if we are to address these questions ?
That is the way I see things .
Since the Commission is the body which initi@@ ates legislation , I urge you , Commissioner , to consider acting on the findings of any such inquiry you may care to set up .
Some of them are already involved and we want more of them involved , including the applicant countries .
It is vital , therefore , that we support a compromise that ensures the effective control and enforcement of workers &amp; quot ; rights by keeping the original purpose of the directive .
As you know , the next ministerial meeting between the EU and the ASEAN countries is due to take place in Europe .
As for his question , the European Union attaches a great deal of importance to the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court .
We should not undermine that .
To enforce effectively Community law , we have used all the instruments that we have .
If it is designed to appe@@ ase Serbia , it will not work .
We cannot throw fish back in the sea .
In my view , our priorities should be policies which promote jobs and growth across the EU , especially at a time when Member States are cutting back on their spending .
I want to respond to the motion for a resolution , not least since I suspect that in it are the b@@ ones of the discussion that we will be having between the Union &amp; apos ; s institutions on CFSP over the coming years .
They have said &amp; quot ; no &amp; quot ; to removing democratic control from the hands of the people .
Let us then draw lessons from this and look forward to a lasting peace in the whole region , including peace between Israel and Palestine .
That is why in 2008 the Commission quickly put forward new legislation for these agencies , which will come into force in the next few months .
Islam is a faith that promotes peace , equality and a secure life .
Mr President , I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 10@@ 2 ( 2 ) .
This is why I wholeheartedly support here tonight the proposal of my colleague , Mrs Roure , and the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
Of course I fully support and agree with what you suggested , and the Commission is working and will continue to work to attract more investors to join .
Therefore , other things have to be put in place and taken into account .
In order to demonstrate this , I remind you that we ask candidate countries to adapt not only their laws but also their constitutions in order to be admitted as members of the European Union .
Mr President , on 29 November the Committee on Culture and Education will hold a hearing of experts on this matter , after which Parliament will want to bring forward specific proposals .
Mr President , before we vote on the resolution as a whole , could you please confirm that the President of Parliament has ruled that the words &amp; apos ; and accompanying explanatory statement &amp; apos ; in paragraph 5 may be deleted ?
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that he has done on this report .
This includes the need to address obstacles to progress on governance , human rights , market openness and foreign investment .
The Commission expects the agency to play a major role in developing and promoting at European level the highest possible standards in this regard .
Our motion now cla@@ sh@@ es with the Presiden@@ tial debate where most of our colleagues are .
In my opinion , the Petitions Committee is very much part of the public face of the European institutions : citizens can access the committee and have their case heard , and it is a crucial part of EU citizenship .
Under present legislation they are often forced to resort to un@@ licens@@ ed medicines .
However , perhaps most importantly , I want to see a transatlantic dialogue .
So it is this - the inspiration for the internal market - that is such an important acquis of our European Union .
I would ask the Commissioner to indicate how the European Union as a whole can take an active role , so that the operators of A@@ P@@ Is are encouraged and helped to come together .
I also agree with the comments made to the effect that eco @-@ labelling labelling needs to be clear and clearly understandable so that it is easily understood by consumers .
I regret that one or two Commissioners did not shoulder their responsibilities but I regret that so many good people , including the President Mr Santer , who have done so much important work and achieved so much success have appeared in the eyes of Europe to be discredited when in fact they are people of honour who have done a good job .
If it does not , the UK Conservative delegation would agree with Mr Hökmark , as well as many other colleagues , and reluctantly vote to reject this report as it stands .
But particularly in the ECB &amp; apos ; s case , as it does not have the track record of the mighty Bundes@@ bank and could quickly lose the confidence of the financial markets if it is reluctant to protect itself through greater transparency .
In the fight against poverty we must ensure that the programmes of the EU are credible , cost @-@ effective effective and targeted .
I would like to ask you to have a vote on this point because that is the only way in which we can reasonably resume the debate on this most important report .
Sadly , this resolution does not call for an immediate end to the fighting , so we will not endorse that approach by taking part in today &amp; apos ; s vote .
However , allow me to address in detail the amendments , which have been proposed .
It could monitor progress towards the stabilisation of CO2 emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 in the Community and it could monitor the fulfilment of the Community &amp; apos ; s commitments under the United Nations framework convention on climate change which entered into force in 1994 .
Furthermore , bearing in mind the attitude and concrete positions of some Member States , this extension would surely jeopardise the unanimous support , which we very much need , in the Council .
Our role in this House is to ensure , if we pass the Lisbon Treaty , that it works effectively .
We have achieved a great deal already .
Li@@ vestock production occup@@ ies a very important place in the agriculture of the Community .
We need courage and imagination - imagination to fill the gaps or to clarify the ambiguities of the treaty .
The current lack of legal certainty , whereby various legal instruments apply to different categories of products , while loopholes exist in other areas , is an obstacle to market safety and to the proper functioning of the single market .
So it is progress of a kind that at least the ordinary people of Croatia will have the final word over EU accession .
I have seen in this debate an opportunity for the Commission to clarify its position on a number of issues .
Since I last addressed you in 2004 , the constructive influence of the European Parliament in advancing the concerns of Europe &amp; apos ; s citizens has continued to grow .
Let us make it flexible - you can help do that - but let us recognise that it has to be a sophisticated instrument in a real economy .
This is also one of the areas which we advocated in our Green Paper on the European Research Area .
The Commission suggests that subsidiarity should be maintained in this area .
For these reasons , the European Conservatives and Reform@@ ists will today abstain on this vote .
And here , it must be said clearly , Europe cannot be naive .
However , there are amendments that cannot be accepted .
If we cannot answer our citizens &amp; quot ; straightforward questions about how we implement EU law , then it is a poor show .
Commissioner Monti will be very well aware of the concerns that are shared by many people who support his proposals for reform but feel that there need to be answers in relation to issues like jurisdiction shopping , legal certainty , the role of national courts , dialogue between the national competition authorities and the Commission itself , as also issues of staffing within the Commission .
With all its successes and shortcomings , this is what we are still doing .
We would be happy to accept such an amendment .
But there is a point where the Commission does not agree with the Council .
I warmly thank the honourable Member for his kind remarks and for his question .
This brings me to your second question .
En@@ coura@@ g@@ ingly , Parliament &amp; apos ; s Agriculture Committee , the Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions and the Member States , largely support the Commission &amp; apos ; s approach to this sensitive issue .
We share enthusiasm for enlargement provided proper institutional reform goes ahead .
His amendments do not reject the concept of harmonisation . They explicitly support it .
We must end it both within and outside the institutions .
This is an important issue and it is a discussion that I have clearly indicated that I welcome .
We have to avoid it .
However , we have different views on the number of sectors that should become subject to the Community regulation fixing nominal quantities .
There is much for Turkey still to do in order to reach European Union standards , including on freedom of religion and the implementation of existing legislation , and the Commission will continue to monitor Turkey &amp; apos ; s progress .
I am pleased to note that the report is supportive of the Commission in a number of areas .
Mr President , there is a long @-@ established established principle in the European Union , established , in fact , by Jean Monnet himself , of the beneficial crisis : whenever something is going badly wrong , whenever national governments are concerned as to what to do , when the public are deeply fearful , then the answer , of course , is more integration and more central control within the European Union .
No civili@@ zed country and no union of civili@@ zed countries can be complacent or tolerant of organized crime , and the citizens of the European Union , in our view , have a right to expect the strongest action at a European level .
The real problem of this debate is a problem we have here .
Frankly , we would have preferred a higher threshold in Article 3 , as regards the represent@@ ativity of European political parties , but we are happy to accept , in the spirit of compromise that is necessary in the European Union , that this somewhat lower threshold will apply .
I wish to congratulate the Commission on the positive way it is facing up to the recommendations made to it by the Temporary Committee and I would like to put on record my tribute to both Commissioners Fischler and Bonino and their staff for the help , assistance and the responsible way in which they have approached this problem and for the way in which they have faced up to their responsibilities .
The Commission has recently released a very disappointing report on the implementation of this directive .
The European Union &amp; apos ; s commitment to this issue is also reflected in the level of Community funding given to NGOs working for ratification .
I am addressing this issue on two fronts , using a combination of political pressure and cooperation , both bilaterally and on a multilateral level .
I should like to tell the Commissioner that fine words are not enough .
We are also witnessing important developments that affect global security , with developments in the Middle East , in Asia and in Africa .
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation .
in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues are fully supportive of EU and international efforts to promote peace , democracy and prosperity for the people of Afghanistan .
Mr President , I also want to address a rigid Commission policy .
I would like to thank the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and especially the rapporteur , Mrs Peijs , for their judi@@ cious and efficient handling of this file .
Today is a new beginning .
There is a strong view , which the Council has acknowledged , that the establishment of the euro will be a major contribution to achieving that .
This is not only odi@@ ous - it is dangerous .
I would certainly concede , and indeed tru@@ m@@ pet , the fact that , in the automobile industry , for example , the markets themselves are providing solutions , such as the growth of hy@@ bri@@ d cars , which are gaining an increasing market share in a number of European countries .
Climate change is also a very important issue .
That is why I hope that Parliament will deliver a positive opinion on this new regulation .
The commission cannot accept the other amendments , which for the most part aim at widening the scope of the directive .
Mr President , I am conscious that your direction to honourable Members also , no doubt , includes the Presidency , so I shall endeavour to keep my answers as brief as is appropriate , given the range of questions that we have been asked .
I am particularly grateful to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for his report on this proposal and to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the support given to most of the modifications proposed by the Commission and for the amendments included in the initial committee &amp; apos ; s report .
I hope Members will draw the appropriate conclusions .
Therefore , it is important to keep these costs to a minimum .
Mr President , I should like to thank all the speakers for their contributions to this afternoon &amp; quot ; s discussion .
I am pleased to say that colleagues in my committee have agreed with the amendments and we have adjusted the report to reflect a continuation of what I did before , not the retro@@ gressive views of the rapporteur in this instance .
Within the European Union an environmental impact assessment must be carried out on the construction of new roads , water and se@@ wage facilities and large infrastructure projects .
I regret to note , however , that this support is not as strong in the final version of Mrs Hon@@ ey@@ ball &amp; apos ; s report as adopted by the ECON Committee .
However , that is not always the case and these actions can easily become a serious and unjustified impediment to our legitimate market access opportunities .
I think it was a very important debate .
The safety of human rights defenders must be the first concern .
And the companies affected are essentially taking on the role of private consumers .
Finally , I expect the Whitehead report to carry overwhelming support in the vote this morning .
Dear friends , we need nothing more than full steam ahead to reinforce economic governance in Europe .
The Commission shares many of the concerns expressed during the discussion and actually supports many of the proposals put forward by Ms Muscardini &amp; apos ; s report .
We need to read@@ dre@@ ss this question .
I believe that a really serious attempt to reform the Community &amp; apos ; s finances should start by making sure that all Member States get their fair share of expenditure .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , thank you for the answer .
It is only the effective persuasion of the rapporteur which makes me think that we should accept the common position and I shall vote accordingly .
In my view that is not the Commission &amp; apos ; s role .
We have also said that the flexibility instrument would not be an annual reserve for category 4 but that is exactly what it has become .
Do we have any plans ?
But there are obviously concerns there and it is right that Parliament should voice these concerns .
I agree that we should try to find ways to make it more permanent and to involve more Member States .
It will have a very long @-@ term term effect on agriculture and as we have known it within the European Union .
We have new countries applying for membership because of this success - because they have seen what the European Union could contribute regarding peace , the rule of law and stability .
If we do not have the money , we cannot undertake the actions and policies we want .
The European Union must do all it can to help developing countries to develop sustainable farming and food production systems that enable them to feed themselves .
All of this be@@ gs the question : what can the European Union do ?
I fully agree with the emphasis placed on this subject in the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s report and I welcome your suggestions regarding strengthened monitoring in this field .
I should like to ask you to refer this matter to the Bureau for investigation .
The prior condition is to ensure that the necessary security conditions are in place for international aid agencies to ensure effective delivery .
As you know , President , my country , Estonia , is making determined efforts to join the euro area by 2011 .
The Commission has certainly taken note , so this will be taken into consideration .
I thank Members of Parliament for their contributions and I agree with most of the remarks that were made .
That is , of course , not necessarily true .
Although the current situation shows signs of consolidation , I still call upon Turkey to finally meet the fundamental accession criteria in recognizing the Republic of Cyprus and withdrawing Turkish army units .
They will have heard - as we have done - the words of Secretary @-@ General General Annan , that the plan &amp; apos ; is the only available and the only foreseeable route to the reunification of Cyprus &amp; apos ; .
That will no longer be possible .
This is why we have designed the proposal this way .
To this end I will apply all means available , including the formal infringement procedures set out in Articles 226 and 2@@ 28 of the European Community Treaty and 14@@ 1 and 14@@ 3 of the Euratom Treaty , which may lead to imposing economic penalties on non @-@ complying complying Member States .
Something like 5 000 people are executed by states every year and 28 000 people langu@@ ish on death row , so it is in@@ exc@@ us@@ able that a full Member State of the European Union should in any way deliver an opinion which seeks to undermine the argument for ending the death penalty .
Me@@ asure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee . We have failed to achieve a qualified majority .
I want to pay tribute to the two Presidents of our Parliament during this parliamentary term .
Furthermore , in countries where abortion is legal for given indications , it should be safe .
I shall be perfectly happy to get a reply from the Commissioner in writing .
They are going to have to pay for them anyway if our citizens take up the rights that this directive will give them .
Mr President , particularly I appreciate your commitment to engaging with our citizens .
My group will vote in favour of this tomorrow .
Therefore , we are calling on the European Union to extend restrictive measures against Lukashenko &amp; apos ; s regime .
As a matter of fact , this report comes at a time where all initiatives aiming at reinforcing concrete actions for greater energy efficiency should be warmly welcomed .
There the Commission supports , and indeed promotes , the initiative aimed at changing and improving the present situation .
But we have to demonstrate clearly that Europe is part of the solution to globalisation , not part of the problem .
We have to think about this .
However , it is inappropriate to talk of an EU seat , as the UN Charter does not allow for organisations such as the EU to become members .
Europe equally needs a strong , independent and credible Commission , and through your vote tomorrow you will mark an important step in this direction .
If necessary , the European Union should be ready to assist these countries with fulfilling the hopefully soon to be established stricter guidelines .
They will see the Parliament adopt different positions in different committees .
This proposal has the simpler and broader aim of improving the quality of the air we all brea@@ the , by reducing emissions of V@@ O@@ Cs , thereby reducing the formation of ozone .
This is the major responsibility , but we are to influence this policy mix at national level in such a way as to discourage building the future of Europe upon debts and deficits because that does not lead anywhere .
I am glad to hear that the Parliament , as well as the Council , is in agreement with the line of the Commission to halt the use of antibio@@ tics for growth promotion from 2006 onwards .
The EU must continue to be seen to uphold promises it has previously made on enlargement .
Women &amp; apos ; s rights are restricted although the situation is much better than in some other Arab states .
We stand ready to offer assistance based on our experience .
It is crucial that the EU applies restrictions on a fishing effort within this area .
But the Commission &amp; apos ; s satisfaction with the post @-@ 2001 2001 regime does not take away our right to ask the Commission about the regulatory regime prior to 2001 , nor the Commission &amp; apos ; s responsibility to answer us .
If an agreement for a new European Treaty is not reached in or around the time of the next European Council meeting of EU leaders , then agreement may be difficult to reach in the medium term .
We must use a more sophisticated sliding scale of sanctions and make it easier to find political agreement in the EU to apply them .
I was struck by the ideals of compromise and consensus contained within his speech .
Such an example of practical cooperation is encouraging for any broader free trade agreement that may come into force later .
If it were to be decided that we need a supranational financial supervision authority , that possibility needs to be provided for in the Treaty after the Convention at the next IGC .
To introduce a further exception would not only distur@@ b the balance of rights achieved , but could also lead to a violation of Member States &amp; apos ; international obligations .
In the end it was after 7 : 00 p.m. before Question Time started .
As far as research is concerned , we have always appreciated the support of the Committee on Budgets , and that has continued this year .
If you see the proposals that the Commission has put forward on economic governance , you will see that our proposal is to use the open coordination method to determine legally @-@ binding binding targets , making the open coordination method more effective and therefore achieving more concrete results .
We should set an example .
We have to go forward with it .
There are cases of inappropriate use of funds which border on financial crimes .
A Single Sky will not solve all of our congestion problems if these Member States and Switzerland do not make a concerted effort to address their specific shortcomings .
Let them decide whether this further leap forward towards a federal Europe is in fact what they want .
If we are serious with our mission , it is evident that we need all forms of low @-@ carbon carbon technologies , including sustainable nuclear power .
Mr President , I think we have to accept this agreement now , although I have serious doubts as to whether we can implement it easily , since the sums it contains are smaller than those which Parliament thinks are necessary .
The way that this should be done - and my views are very close to those of the Commission - is to have a first @-@ year year wide @-@ open open debate - let a thousand flo@@ wers bloo@@ m - then move to a broad , deliber@@ ative body that will draft the changes that are necessary .
I will just mention a few of the proposals that we would like the Commission to consider .
Last time out , Madam President , we narro@@ wly missed getting a majority .
Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , I would like to ask you about the EU @-@ USA USA @-@ Russia Russia tri@@ angle .
Mr President , may I say that this discussion once again shows that we have a strong responsibility for the situation in Slovakia .
The Commission considers that the European Union , together with the rest of the international community , must take decisive steps to contain the repercussions of the crisis in the Great L@@ akes countries which in a variety of ways , as Members have said , threaten the security and stability of the whole of Africa .
Let us help them increase their democracy and develop prosperity and , if they would like to take some free advice , let them keep well away from the European Union and preserve their freedom and independence .
If , in the future , we look back , I am quite sure that we will never regret the efforts we can make today in order to support European integration with all the different means we have , but we might very well , in the future , regret the efforts we have not made .
It is indeed put forward explicitly as a way to engage the North Ko@@ re@@ ans and discourage them from the worst form of military threat that there could be - namely , a nuclear threat .
It is the position of my group that we accept and promote the parallel@@ ism and the strong complementarity between a Members &amp; apos ; Statute and reform of the travel allowances .
In these discussions the issue of affor@@ dability of key pharmaceuticals often takes the most prominent position .
We need to make sure that this does not happen , as it really e@@ ats away at people .
Experi@@ ences on other agreements have , however , taught us that it may very well be two or three years before the last EU Member State rati@@ fies the Agreement .
This is another step in the process of peace and stability in the former Yugoslavia and I would hope that we will support those elections to the fullest .
( The sitting was suspended at 5.@@ 25 and resumed at 5@@ .30 p.m. )
Thus , the Commission has proposed that the centralised authorisation procedure for all medicines containing new active substances be made mandatory .
That comprehensive approach involves legal and illegal immigration , as well as integration .
This has to stop .
We are only just starting the negotiations and have not yet entered into discussions on substance .
What a needless waste of resources and time .
Within the framework of its legislative proposal , the Commission will therefore include a biofuel sustainability scheme designed to ensure that the biofuel sector plays its part in tackling this issue .
We speak about democracy on the 60@@ th anniversary of the end of the Second World War .
As other colleagues have said , this is a thoroughly odd proposal .
deputising for the author . - Mr President , firstly , I want to say that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague , Alain C@@ ade@@ c , who was to be the speaker here this afternoon .
A triumph of bureaucrats over experts from the sectors is not a good deal .
We need your help in explaining at all levels - to the media , to national audi@@ ences - the proportions of this debate , how much we in Europe can achieve with just 1 % of GDP , the structure of the European budget with almost 95 % of this budget going back to national economies with high value @-@ added added from the European Union .
I call on the Commission and Member States to establish proper criteria and benchmarks in order to evaluate the results achieved .
Last but not least , general and business aviation , despite the ongoing technological advances , are also imp@@ acting on the environment and , like the wider airline industry , they need to contribute to reducing these impacts .
In recent days we have seen far @-@ right right ideas which are contrary to the very basic values of our European project inf@@ ecting political life in Belgium and Italy and influencing political decisions and actions .
Their pro@@ xim@@ ity to consumer concerns makes them an interesting partner for implementing the policy objectives of EU consumer policy .
This should certainly take into account the challenge of the ageing European population .
But consumer law needs to be very much accessible and understandable to our citizens for our internal market to work .
Finally , we have to recognise the real difficulties of applying these new proposals in every circum@@ stance and on every application that we find in the vast ar@@ ray of options inside the European Union .
I entirely agree with the honourable Member about the importance of Serbia and Montenegro moving towards the European Union .
Of course the Council agrees that we need transparent and effective agencies .
Thank you for your attention and please vote in favour of discharge .
A new regulation is needed and it should help prevent environmental pollution as a consequence of natural disasters .
Many of the recommendations are valid for all Member States and not just the new countries .
Mr President , having spent the previous twenty @-@ four four hours agon@@ izing over how I should vote on Iraq , I was rather concerned to see that my vote was wrongly recorded on Amendment No 12 .
We note the deb@@ ac@@ le of the EU &amp; apos ; s slow and small efforts in Haiti , and thus we feel that the EU cannot be trusted in future humanitarian crises .
As regards GMOs and plant gene@@ tics , the proposals that were adopted in committee would put genetically @-@ modified modified foods on our table and will be forced on European consumers , quite contrary to what many want .
If Parliament objects to an implementing measure adopted under comitology , then the Commission must either withdraw it , amend it or take account of Parliament &amp; apos ; s objection in some other way , or come before the House to make a statement to explain why it is taking any other course of action .
Two points which should be obvious to all of us , as democrats concerned about issues such as global social equity , but nevertheless important to make .
What message does the Council and Commission have for them ?
We need to understand that this will involve considerable change , because of the new st@@ y@@ les of education systems that we need today .
Moreover , it greatly anno@@ ys users who have to work their way through great quantities of unwanted commercial messages .
It is a conference for those who are concerned about these things .
To establish credibility for the Commission , the Presidency and for Parliament , it is necessary for us to be seen to be taking decisive action on what is un@@ question@@ ably one of the issues of concern , not simply to the business community across Europe , but also to our citizens .
I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur , Mr Newton @-@ Dunn Dunn , for the way he has guided this proposal through Parliament .
Mr President , the current European economic and social model has unfortunately not brought about the desired results .
I do not think that is acceptable .
You will also not be surprised that I cannot share the view that the ECB &amp; apos ; s decision @-@ making making process might have been delayed by the fact that most Governing Council decisions have so far been taken by consensus .
We can and should aim to facilitate a political settlement , and having facilitated it not then walk away .
I was not surprised to see that mentioned in the report .
First , it must be simple .
I certainly hope that with the passing of the Europol Convention we will now see greater cooperation under the third pillar .
Equally , we wish to make sure that the demands of Parliament vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis the Intergovernmental Conference , in particular the example of obligatory and non @-@ obligatory obligatory expenditure , are taken up within the Intergovernmental Conference and that we reach a satisfactory solution on it .
Madam President , I may be mistaken but I understood that the intention was indeed to have a resolution .
The directive will authorise Member States to charge tol@@ ls on lor@@ ries not only for infrastructure costs , as is the case now , but also for noise and air pollution .
So our poor treatment by the Council should not compromise the EU &amp; apos ; s agreement with the United States , or any future agreements on the security of Europe .
Mr President , I should like to add my congratulations to those already expressed to the rapporteur , to the Spanish presidency and to Commissioner Busquin who has been exemplary in his patience , understanding and respect for Parliament &amp; apos ; s opinions .
But we in the European Parliament - what are we doing ?
We need to have a balance here .
We are , as you know , already working hard in that area .
At no time would Parliament ever take out legislation that supported that .
I ask the Canadian Government and the public to show the same respect to us Europeans .
While we acknowledge the need to improve the law and order situation - and we are ready to support the government of Bangladesh in its attempt to restore law and order - we firmly believe that this must be done under the rule of law and with full respect for human rights .
It is clear that a compromise is going to have to be found between those countries which are claiming that they contribute too much to the EU , as equally , those countries which have received favourable treatment from the European Union annual budget in recent years .
This is also good for industry as there is more consistency in terms of harmonisation and clarity across the EU Member States .
The draft aims to solve the problem of labelling foods when operators have tried to avoid using GM material and can prove this but nevertheless small amounts of GM material are found in them .
As Mr Cox has said , we campaig@@ ned for enlargement but against the Nice Treaty , because it is not in the interests of the countries coming in , nor is it in the interests of the existing Member States .
Nevertheless , the Commission will study the question of the field of protection for inventions relating to gene sequ@@ ences in depth and will communicate its observations to the Council and Parliament in the reports provided for by Directive 98 / 44 .
We will be keeping an eye on that .
It is a power@@ fully significant report for the work of this House because it is about legislative quality control .
So the next step will be to examine the Commission &amp; apos ; s text in the Council so as to finalise a report in time for the European Council meeting in March .
But there is also a realisation that further substantial political reforms are going to have to take place in Turkey before final accession negotiations can conclude .
I would also like to thank the Committee of European Securities Regulators for its excellent work .
Most of you know that this is the leading cause of death across the EU of women aged between 35 and 59 , and we want Member States to set up nation@@ wide screening programmes and breast cancer specialist units among other things .
We are having this debate in a legislative vacuum if we have no flexibility of amendment . We see Regulation No 8@@ 20 / 97 sli@@ pping away from us into a mor@@ ass of half @-@ observed observed voluntary practices with no immediate prospects of the compulsory scheme which every Member of this House knows is necessary .
Can I take the opportunity to say that it is good that we are having this debate here tonight and getting some things out in the open .
I will , of course , study Parliament &amp; apos ; s resolution on this important and challenging issue .
I hope that the EU in particular will try to encourage the United Nations - which at this very moment is undertaking reforms - to respond to events in the problem areas of the world .
C@@ lose consideration should be given to how inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases are monitored by European Union institutions .
The European Commission previously committed to closely involving the European Parliament in the review process .
But , in giving our agreement , we do so on the basis of faith that these measures will be re@@ balanced with procedural guarantees .
It is about reducing Member States &amp; apos ; dependency on single outs@@ ource countries .
The &amp; quot ; Aid for Trade &amp; quot ; agenda provides a useful means of working towards effective development and I would like to see it progress , while of course hoping that the Commission will continue to press for substantive progress in the WTO itself .
With China well on its way to reducing its carbon intensity by 45 % , it is in our economic interest to make sure that we take these measures , or we are going to be left behind economically .
A second concern of ours is this key principle , which we support and which needs to be developed further , namely the separation of regulation from service providers .
This is contradictory and undermines our credibility .
Mr President , I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this issue here today .
Mr President , I support Mrs Blo@@ ch von Blo@@ t@@ tn@@ itz &amp; apos ; s report .
Gre@@ ening finances may be an even more important task for this planet and policymakers than greening industry .
I will be very honest with you on this point .
Then the Commission will take that a step forward .
There is also an annual reporting mechanism , and the annual report will be made public and will definitely be available to the European Parliament .
Mr President , I would like to express my satisfaction at the outset at the progress that has been made on this proposal for a directive on food supplements .
We must also pursue opportunities for saving energy , above all in the transport sector .
These are detailed in some of the amendments that we will be supporting .
In the report on asylum and sustainable solutions that Parliament adopted yesterday , one of the things we agreed was that the European Union &amp; apos ; s common foreign policy and common security policy needed to focus on conflict resolution and prevention , paying special attention to long @-@ term term conflict situations .
I have one final brief remark to make .
Our job as the Presidency is to ensure that the conditions are met and that the framework for doing so is agreed .
Everyone in this Chamber knows that energy efficiency is the most important component of energy policy .
As the Commissioner knows , respect for someone else &amp; apos ; s language , respect for that person and his or her culture and customs , helps support the integration of those communities .
Instead of being reassured by this action , third countries have , in many cases , responded with both excessive and , in my view , unnecessary restrictions .
I am cautious , as I think we all are , to the extent of wanting to be reassured that the reform is in the right direction .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Mr President , sometimes , in this Chamber , we cannot really see the political differences between groups , but , on this issue , the difference is very visible , because I could not disagree more with the rapporteur on some of the points she just mentioned .
However , as I have already said , skilled workers are also badly needed in their own countries if there is to be a genuine development of those regions .
Mr President , my speech looks at the relationship between the Eastern Partnership and the Black Sea synergy .
There is a PPE @-@ DE DE amendment on paragraph 125 that I have tabled .
I have no information on that , and so I cannot answer that question .
This was jointly prepared with the Commission , the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
This point has already been made in the Commission &amp; apos ; s communication in 1998 on the same issue .
I think it is right that , where local transport - as Mr Jarzembowski has referred to - is not included , there are public service contracts which mean that the companies will reach the same sort of standards .
De@@ di@@ cated human rights dialogues offer a particularly valuable opportunity to address the issue .
As highlighted in the Common Agenda for Integration , which I put forward in September 2005 , greater integration efforts are crucial for a successful common European immigration policy .
There are some who ask whether this will be the last enlargement .
I would like to isolate four points which are of particular significance .
I strongly appreciated the significant amount of work undertaken in order to achieve a timely delivery of Parliament &amp; quot ; s opinion , as well as the active involvement of Member States and the fishing sector in this debate .
We make use of our Legal Service to assist with our obligations under international conventions and with the basic safety standards which it is the role of the Commission to establish .
This approach has been successfully pione@@ ered by the Canadian Government , and is reflected in the European Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals for a common immigration policy .
They must be tackled if the strategy is to come into reality and provide benefits , jobs and a boost to our economy .
I think we should have a rule that we should know at least two hours in advance who will take the floor in the one @-@ minute minute speeches .
Colleagues , listen to your conscience and vote against this budget .
The conciliation meeting itself was conducted in a most efficient and cooperative manner and the delegations must be given full credit for a job well done .
I very much hope Macedonia will keep working on becoming a mature European democracy , regardless of what Greece does .
We must adopt alternative fuels - bio@@ diesel , fuel cells , gas and electric cars .
Both Syria and Lebanon have an important role to play .
Consensus , compromise , cooperation - yes , that is the way forward , but most importantly of all , we must convince the people that it is the right way forward .
It offers a small increase and that is a reasonable compromise .
Mr President , I should like to thank the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office for his reply .
Mr President , I also supported the Auken report .
The reform programme is heading in the right direction .
I thank the Commissioner for a very thorough answer and ask him three questions .
And I would suggest that the EU should only import food produced under the standards it demands of its own producers , and not accept lower standards in relation to animal welfare , food safety and the environment .
We hope this will provide a much better framework for our work together in this field , so thank you again for the debate .
Mr President , the European Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament and the international community on democracy in Algeria .
Let us look at the figures .
Network security has become a major policy concern and therefore a central issue in the eEurope 2005 action plan .
We have chosen to emphasise the organisational and policy frameworks that are needed for the optimal coordination of culture in the EU &amp; apos ; s external actions .
Therefore , my Group , although it supports the two reports , wants a lot more from you , Commissioner , and from our Member States .
I am pleased to note that there is strong support for the proposal , with only a small number of amendments .
Secondly , the summit confirmed that the EU and Russia see eye @-@ to to @-@ eye eye on the underlying necessity of construc@@ ting a strong EU @-@ Russia Russia strategic partnership in the future .
We have seen the difficulty of inser@@ ting EU legislation into the existing fabric of Member States &amp; quot ; legal and regulatory systems . It does not always fit .
I am really happy with the direction in which the Commission is taking the energy debate , the environmental debate and the debate on climate change .
The final point I want to make relates to the most recent special report , which is a rar@@ ity - special reports from the Ombudsman are a rar@@ ity - relating to the need for the Council to meet in public when making law .
That is why I now believe that , as soon as the Czechs verify their situation , we should move forward .
This discussion brought a lot of doubts and a lot of concrete measures , which , in a way , had already been anticipated by the Commission .
This has led to religious wars and to the committing of despicable crimes against human beings in the name of religion .
First , I welcome the emphasis the report places on the certification of biofuels to ensure that , whether produced in Europe or abroad , they need sustainability standards .
Member of the Commission . - I fully understand your preoccupation , but we in the Commission have to operate under the very clear rules established , especially for the field of budget allocations and budget disbursement .
It was mentioned that the money will have to be spent wisely .
Let me highlight some key areas , those I believe to be politically very sensitive .
But this resolution must be well balanced and recognize the fact that there are difficulties on both sides and it is both sides that have eventually to come together and reach agreement .
To have such a body introduced in the European Parliament as part of a raft of similar measures , which will increase our concern and care for food safety in the European Union , is a good outcome to what has been a sad t@@ ale .
The best way for Kosovo to move towards European integration is by creating a democratic and multi @-@ ethnic ethnic society , with full respect for the rule of law , cooperating peacefully with its neighbours and contributing to regional and European stability .
Finally , the question of landmines , which has already been touched on by other speakers .
I would make one final plea to the British Government : please listen and accept this report so we can plan for the future .
I give the Commission notice that I will be asking it when it last did that .
The European Union has a shared responsibility to bringing about in the region the change from an economy of st@@ rif@@ e to an economy of peace .
We cannot be in a situation where we allow that to happen again , and I therefore salute the measures the Commissioner has taken .
This was outlined by the Commissioner when she indicated that agreements require the exercise of responsibility from all those involved .
&amp; apos ; What seems to be the problem , Madam ? &amp; apos ;
I wish to place on record my support and appreciation for the hard work and expertise Richard Corbett has put into reforming Parliament &amp; apos ; s rules .
So here is a part of our answer in the 2012 budget .
These are the weeks when we have to accept that Europe &amp; apos ; s role requires responsibilities as well as rhetoric , that we are charged with the difficult , as well as the detailed .
It has been a very ple@@ asu@@ rable experience .
This dialogue aims at improving mutual knowledge and understanding .
For these reasons the Commission is not in a position to accept Amendments Nos 3 , 4 and 5 .
It just goes to show where the Commission &amp; apos ; s interests lie .
Finally , I come to the cru@@ x of the matter : whether Parliament should vote for the recommendation .
Will the Commission give its view on the progress made in attaining the objectives of the Tampere Council on Immigration and Asylum , particularly with reference to the issue of managing migration and building closer relationships with sending countries ?
Frankly , over the past five years we , here , have got somewhat fed up with the excess of words spoken about the need to help the 18 million plus unemployed in the European Union .
If that great nation is to be embraced as a strategic partner in the years ahead , then we in Europe need to be assured that it will pursue the same kind of values and standards on democracy and human rights as we do .
However , the EC has frequently commented on such matters , and the Commission in particular has made some excellent statements .
Madam President , I also am disappointed that this House was not able to send a balanced and reasonable message .
We have to remember that the re@@ mitt@@ ances from such people often outweigh the aid which our governments give .
In conclusion , I refer to what I said earlier : there is a considerable degree of convergence between the thinking in the European Parliament , the Council , industry , consumers and the Commission .
I am sure that Parliament will adopt these reports .
It seems a long time ago , but it still remains in our mem@@ ories .
We had an opportunity to discuss this issue in this House quite recently .
Second , we must rebalance the proposed legislation on economic governance .
It exclu@@ des the current EU candidates for membership and the potential candidate countries of the western Balkans which have separate special arrangements .
I do not say that the European Union is hypocritical because , of course , we apply the same standards within our own borders , happily s@@ wat@@ ting aside referendum results when we deem them to have gone the wrong way .
Europe needs to set an example if it is to insist on other parts of the world following its lead .
Your report will certainly help us in our reflections on how to increase coherence generally across the EU &amp; apos ; s human rights policies .
We must stop the problem of refugees &amp; apos ; in or@@ bit &amp; apos ; .
We need to tackle this issue urgently and swiftly but in a coherent way .
We must ensure the good functioning of the Union for our citizens present and future .
I personally find it ab@@ omin@@ able that the Hamas government openly supported the suicide Pass@@ over attack in T@@ el Avi@@ v recently and continue to allow ro@@ cket attacks which fall in@@ discrimin@@ ately and deliberately on civilian targets in Israel : a war crime under international law .
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3 , 5 , 13 and 15 on including syn@@ thetic alcohol in the proposal as far as the system of data collection is concerned .
Mr President , I come from that part of Europe where America was , and still is , seen as a European power .
We look forward to the body preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which it would be appropriate for a representative of this Parliament to chair , producing a document which can confer direct rights on EU citizens and enable them as individuals to enforce their rights in the European Court .
Of course , many of us are deeply concerned about migration problems in relation to our nations .
They use it for bri@@ ber@@ y , corruption and the free flow of drugs and la@@ under@@ ed money throughout the Community .
However , this report shows the continuing need for more financial investment in education and training .
We asked you to come forward with proposals that would cover issues like individual responsibility ( which you mentioned ) , transparency and accountability of firms , shorter procedures , the right to defence and due process , and mechanisms to ensure the effective operation of leni@@ ency applications , but also corporate compliance programmes and the development of European standards .
Beyond this regional framework , the European Union &amp; apos ; s bilateral dialogue , including through sub @-@ committees committees dealing with gender issues , is an important method for addressing these pressing concerns .
Such a strategy is the ground for a foreign energy policy and this is a peace project for the world , because these technologies will diminish pressure on resources and it is a business opportunity for Europe .
I very much welcome this report and I am pleased that the committee has taken the initiative to prepare before the mid @-@ term term review , so that amendments can be made at that stage .
However , should they fail in their endeavours then , at the second reading stage , Parliament , through the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , will act and legislate in this area .
Before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty , there was a division of tasks in which the Commission negotiated market access of foreign direct investment ( F@@ D@@ I ) while the Member States signed investment protection agreements with third states .
I would now like to say a few words about the planned governance system which is proposed for the operational implementation of the strategy .
The ALDE Group will take a principled line of voting against all amendments , including recital 12 . That is not because we do not think some of the amendments have merit .
Colleagues , it gives me great pleasure today to welcome to the European Parliament in Strasbourg the President of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro , Mr Mar@@ o@@ vi@@ ć .
This is clearly stated in our legislative programme , and that is what I said to the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs during our structural dialogue on the priorities for next year .
Our political goal remains to strike the right balance between the fundamental right to security of citizens , which is , first of all , the right to life , and the other fundamental rights of individuals , including privacy and procedural rights .
I , along with all members of the House , would not condone any terrorism , whether institutional or par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary .
In Europe much has already been done to fight cyber crime .
The themes which are mentioned in our strategy for gender equality are the same as the ones the rapporteur has mentioned : economic independence for women , gender pay gap , violence against women and promoting gender equality in external actions .
But we would wish that they would share best practice that is available and we try and make that available to them .
The one thing we have asked the Council to do is to try and find an agreement on these two items during the July conciliation procedure .
It is important to talk about both successes and problems , because this is a way of securing even greater recognition for cohesion policy and eliminating future problems .
in writing . - Tackling climate change at this moment of deep financial turmoil and decre@@ ased confidence in economic systems may seem for many a mistake in terms of priorities .
At the same time , throughout history European integration has proved helpful to he@@ al wo@@ unds and injustice of the past , so we need to concentrate on the future as well .
In that regard there is the question of the free movement of labour .
Therefore , there are many conflicting viewpoints among parliamentarians on this issue and there are conflicting viewpoints among Member State governments on the scope of the Services Directive to include healthcare costs .
Mr President , I listened to the Commissioner with increasing hope that this debate would lead to something more than the warm words and hot air that we have seen on this subject so far .
If we are trying to build the European economy based on cross @-@ border border trade , consumers have to be aware of their rights and entitlements and how these are enforced and communicated .
Mr President , at a time when the national governments are having to tri@@ m their budgets and when all our constituents are having to make savings in their household budgets , how typical that the European Union , uniquely , should presume to be substantially increasing its budget .
This seems a very curious way of going about it , so we think the Commission is right to aim for indicative targets .
In response to what Mr Wiersma and other Members said concerning the presidential election scheduled for 19 March , the Commission regrets that the European Parliament has not been invited to observe the elections .
I should like to thank the Commissioner and all colleagues who spoke in that debate .
Whilst many of the recommendations from the rapporteur are completely acceptable and while the UK may practise the essential elements of the tax regime proposed already , we do not believe it is the role of the EU to set a rate of taxes in Member States .
But there comes a time when one must grasp the opportunity .
Whatever differences exist as regards perspectives about defence cooperation in the European Union , it seems this is something that could unite us .
In line with the international community , the European Union feels that these agreements offer an initial platform for tackling the various crises bes@@ etting Sudan , thereby providing a comprehensive and lasting solution to Sudan &amp; quot ; s various crises , Darfur among them .
It provides an explicitly legal basis for the Neighbourhood Policy , establishes a single legal personality of the Union as a whole and obliges Member States to consult one another and to demonstrate mutual solidarity .
An open Europe , a more self confident Europe , a forward @-@ looking looking Europe is what we need .
The one lot of people that we have not consulted about this are the electorates and I would love to see issues like this put before our voters to see whether they approve of our voting ourselves additional resources at such a time , when now all of them are tightening their own bel@@ ts .
The Commission can accept many of the amendments proposed in the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s report .
Our paper analysed the nature , size and responsibilities of a future international engagement ; it also set out the EU &amp; quot ; s role after the status settlement and practical means to realise Kosovo &amp; quot ; s future European perspective .
However , one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence .
Mr President , I am grateful to the Commissioner for that information and for some signs of progress in the study of this issue .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , if I understand the last point correctly , it is about how can we enforce whatever we agree upon .
Mr President , concerning the issue of climate change there are two main areas in which the EU is playing a key role .
I do not question the right of EU Member States to engage with the United States on issues which are national prerogatives , for example cooperation between intelligence services or air mar@@ sha@@ l programmes , but we are of the view that what the US is asking from all of us in different visa @-@ related related issues raises serious legal and political questions .
in writing . - I hope that Parliament will not confine itself simply to producing reports and votes .
While the successful completion of the enlargement process is clearly being focused upon by all institutions , we must avoid becoming too inward @-@ looking looking in the Union .
The EU is the largest donor in the world .
We are not discussing whether to say &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; or &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; to GMOs .
I would like to express my admiration for those who responded to the tragedy but also , if possible , to request some help with re @-@ housing housing many of those who lost their homes in this tragedy .
In conclusion , let me thank Parliament and , in particular , the members of the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur for their constructive engagement on this important fight .
So that is what our question is here tonight .
I want to ask you whether we can have any hope that this will happen .
Therefore , we would ask the Commission to keep that close watch on what is going to happen .
In other words , Parliament is a key player in this .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , I am particularly glad of the opportunity to participate on behalf of the Council in the debate on the extension of the Schengen area to Bulgaria and Romania .
At the same time , we have to see to it that we stay united and committed to the fight against terrorism .
These International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) Safety Fundament@@ als and the obligations of the Convention of Nuclear Safety constitute the core of the directive .
It sets time limits , gradu@@ ated in accordance with the difficulties involved , and it sets new standards of reference which should and will be respected .
We need the help of Parliament .
That is a vote at which colleagues should be present .
Perhaps the Council and the Commission might care to introduce some reforms for future acc@@ essions .
We need to engage the US in constructive multilateral dialogue and to strengthen parliamentary involvement in this whole dialogue .
Mr President , I am not going to repeat the comments made by our rapporteurs , which I fully support , but I would like to come back to Article 39 of the Treaty of Accession .
Certainly , the need to increase progress on combating poverty within the European Union is an extremely important issue .
First , we have to introduce a major programme of investment in energy conservation in Europe .
As I indicated earlier , this is essentially a matter between two Member States .
We have a clear part to play .
As I said , the response is still forthcoming .
So , to summarise , I believe that we have created a framework for cities that share an ambition to develop sustainable models for their citizens , and that is the Covenant of Ma@@ y@@ ors .
Small and / or innovative financial products should be dealt with either in specific financial sector directives or in a future consumer protection directive .
On behalf of my committee , I would like to ask the Council to elaborate on the progress achieved .
Across Europe at this moment , there are discussions , consultations and referenda taking place , and I am not talking about Lisbon but about proposals for constitutional change and for greater autonomy in these countries .
I have noted the importance of in voting to @-@ day day .
Indeed , the directive aims at achieving both a high level of environmental protection and contributing to the proper functioning of the internal market .
I believe in Parliament , and I believe in Europe , and future histori@@ ans will understand that the spirit of Europe lives here .
I cannot accept its removal and must therefore reject the amendment .
It is very important that we do two things : firstly , we have to try and raise awareness amongst businesses right across Europe to ensure they are vigilant and do not fall f@@ oul of these misleading companies and , secondly , we have to bring in legislation that ensures that , when they are taken to court , they either cease trading or are put behind bar@@ s .
The rapporteur will have the chance of getting a core of sensible amendments together at second reading that will have the support of the clear majority of Members of this House .
That is why we have adopted a citizens &amp; quot ; agenda for Europe .
In its political dialogue and in its further contacts with China , the EU &amp; apos ; s representatives regularly encourage China to use this process pragmati@@ cally in order to address all outstanding issues relating to Tibet .
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , Commissioner , my group shall support the work of the rapporteurs and I congratulate them on its eleg@@ ant balance .
At a time when the international community is galvan@@ ised to address the en@@ dem@@ ic problems that Africa faces , it is only appropriate that we look beyond poverty relief to the maintenance of good governance , transparency , the rule of law and respect for human rights for all African countries .
Before talking about the most controversial aspect of this directive , I would like to dwell on some of the areas where we have managed to find a consensus within Parliament so far .
I said Member States must stick to the common line and we appe@@ aled very often to them to do so during our negotiations .
Mr President , perhaps I might deal with a few of the issues that were addressed , particularly in relation to health matters .
Mr President , we should not forget that the problem of the fishing industry worldwide is over@@ fishing and over@@ capacity .
Mr President , the EU attaches great importance to the Conference .
When you think about it , the Union spends only 3 % of public expenditure .
My report is very clear on this .
As the Committee quite rightly notes , one of the objectives of this Treaty is the extension of the EC energy market to the countries of the region through their implementation of the on energy , environment , competition and renewables .
We believe that the international community should follow the situation very closely .
The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg will judge on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which , by the way , is binding for all Member States .
This reflected scientific advice that the use of antibio@@ tics as growth promo@@ ters is undesirable for human and animal health , owing to concerns about increased resistance of diseases to treatment with antibio@@ tics .
The Commission , like others , has urged dialogue .
Europe must welcome the latter if she wants to be true to herself .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution on the EP &amp; apos ; s annual report on the CFSP .
Prime Minister , thank you for your speech and presentation of the programme of activities of the Hungarian Presidency of the Council .
There is an important Election Observation Mission there with your colleague , Mrs De Keyser ; secondly , to underline the importance of European Union financial support to the Palestinian people , and , thirdly , to thus raise the visibility of a number of EU projects , notably in Gaza .
Together as political democratic bodies we are working on a range of issues of mutual importance , including the following : addressing the increasing importance of energy and environmental issues , including climate change via the EU Rio Group , working together on many projects to promote conflict resolution , the rule of law , democracy , good governance and human rights , and putting in place a stronger level of third level education links between our two groupings .
That is why I abstained in this vote .
And , with the treaty in force , it is time to move even more decisively beyond institutional discussions towards policies and results for citizens .
Although Member States certainly have responsibilities for securing their own energy supplies , the need for cooperation early in a crisis situation will be vital .
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .
. I voted in favour of this report , which had been substantially strengthened at committee stage through the adoption of all nine amendments I had tabled .
Madam President , I am afraid I must raise this issue again .
Therefore I see no reason why we should not go for an exhaustive ballot on this occasion .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , this is not just a courtesy : it is always a great pleasure to listen to such distinguished lawyers talking about one of the most important things to have happened in recent years in the area of civil law .
Madam President , I think that , when one considers the European project , there is a di@@ al@@ ec@@ tic at its heart .
Per@@ mission to grant such grant aid to companies setting up in the Objective 1 region serves a very positive economic and social purpose .
Not only do existing policies need to be reviewed but also how decisions in the European Union are going to be taken in the future .
I want to express my sincere thanks to the European Parliament for its cooperation .
Dear colleagues , we look forward to welcoming Croatian observers to the European Parliament very soon and we look forward to sitting with you in this House in the course of this parliamentary term .
For example , the report which we are debating today recommends a rotation system for the composition of the European Commission .
I hope that our rapporteur will take note of these comments .
Nevertheless , we recognise that the experience in all Member S@@ ates is not the same and some recourse to such measures may be justified , as a temporary remedy , to rebalance female representation where women are grossly under @-@ represented represented .
Furthermore , some Member States have one control service , others have several , and difficulties may be identified in some but not in others .
The action of the Ombudsman in referring those cases for which he does not have direct responsibility to the appropriate institution is an excellent way of dealing with such complaints .
The European Union is ready to do its part by keeping Member States united and respectful of European common legislation and competence .
Integration is at the heart of the programme and the programme is at the heart of the Community &amp; apos ; s sustainable development strategy , which we shall be taking forward with Parliament &amp; apos ; s support as demonstrated in Strasbourg earlier this month , to the World Summit in Johannesburg after the summer , and from then on of course .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I first of all should thank Parliament for having addressed the Commission proposal as a matter of urgency and I know this is not easy at all .
We have the Ombudsman &amp; apos ; s very good service , Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Petitions , the Commission itself , which accepts complaints , and ourselves as MEPs , who receive constituents &amp; apos ; case @-@ work work , as well as SOLVIT and EURO@@ J@@ US@@ T .
Creating this fresh momentum is a key goal of our ongoing review of sustainable development , ensuring that our internal and external actions are better coordinated .
I trust this report will receive widespread and deser@@ ved approval .
- Before the vote on Amendment 1 :
I believe that there are grave dangers in what we are doing .
We are even supporting some of the amendments from the Green Group , but not an amendment which would actually limit the way it is written and would actually set a ceiling on the transparency requirement .
Food additives are only permitted if it is demonstrated that there is a technological need for them and consumers are not misled and will benefit from having a choice of new products with better quality .
I note that if Amendments Nos 100 and 101 were both to be adopted , it would come to exactly the same text as this compromise amendment , except for the problematic word &amp; quot ; more &amp; quot ; .
Nevertheless , the decision has now been taken to proceed as quickly as possible .
It is a very good report .
For these reasons we voted in favour of the report .
On that basis , I shall make a few comments on what the rapporteur and some other speakers have said .
It looks to the future , not to the past .
I stress my hope that parliamentary cooperation will continue to have an important role to play in that process .
It also raises interinstitutional dis@@ trust and we are all concerned by this situation .
Since 2001 , the &amp; apos ; Programme of Action for Mainstreaming Gender Equality in Community Development Cooperation &amp; apos ; has given us a framework within which we have implemented an extensive training programme and developed political tools .
I hope that this vote today will encourage the Council to ensure fairness across all 25 Member States for the remaining time of the current experiment ; and I also say , with the full support of the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mrs Berès , that we should be pressing the Council to make this a permanent feature of our hopes of achieving the Lisbon Strategy .
The European Union is well placed to promote this dialogue .
I approached them yesterday in relation to a ruling on paragraph 89 of the Commission &amp; apos ; s legislative proposals .
However , it is imperative that security for women throughout the country is a priority for both donors and the Afghan Government .
Our electors ask us what we are doing to prevent catastrophes like these ?
However , I would also like to point out that we still have large reserves of coal throughout the EU and , with the development of clean coal technology , I pose the question whether or not our aband@@ onment of coal , as a source of energy , was premature ?
In what ways is the Commission working to prevent the growth of protectionist tendencies in its international trade negotiations ?
The scope of the ban should cover every material with a mercury concentration of 5 % or more .
The problem is , however , what other instruments are available that will produce results ?
Last but not least , the fifth point is that we need to work together .
It regrets nevertheless that its amendment on the issue of the sett@@ lers has not been adopted by the House .
This strategy aims to introduce a coherent approach to the coastal zones across Europe but the recommendation inten@@ tionally leaves the choice of the format of the national strategies to the Member States to ensure that each national strategy is tailor @-@ made made to the institutional , physical and social conditions within each Member State .
When we are ready I will announce it in Parliament .
Madam President , let me begin by congratulating all the rapporteurs on their very hard work over a very long period of time .
The fact that the new High Representative will also be a Vice @-@ President President of the Commission , responsible for coordinating all of the EU &amp; apos ; s external action , will help .
The draft resolution on the European Patent L@@ iti@@ gation Agreement could , if implemented , place patent disputes in the hands of these who have a vested interest in a very wide use of patents , it would lead to extra costs for SME , cause an explo@@ sion in litigation and potentially restrict innovation in Europe .
It stands ready to assume the new responsibilities incumbent upon it in terms of Romania &amp; apos ; s new status as a Nato member and future Member State of the European Union .
Mr President , I am acutely aware of the problems presented to the I@@ ber@@ ian pen@@ insula by the issue of water .
Let us take the first step in that direction during this mandate .
But just as important is the establishment of a trading scheme which can give the needed flexibility , and to ensure that this will work in an EU @-@ wide wide market .
Harmon@@ izing business taxation has no place on any EU agenda .
Through the air transport liberalization programme the European Union has taken steps to create the climate necessary for airlines to offer competi@@ tively priced air@@ fares to the citizens of Europe .
On that basis , the current state of affairs is not satisfactory , but nor is what is proposed .
Firstly , there is the issue of SMEs , which was raised in the report .
I think it is a very good outcome for us : Parliament has gained , insofar as we have maintained codecision under Article 179 , which is a very important principle to us .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteurs and I welcome the Commission &amp; apos ; s second progress report .
We all know that , unlike some other EU partners in the Far East , we share common values of democracy , human rights and the liberal market economy with Japan , making her a more natural partner for the European Union .
In the Middle East there has been no progress made .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I was not , of course , thinking of the Honourable Member when I made my comment .
The discussions and proposals demonstrate that Parliament shares the policy objectives and wishes to vigorously improve current performance .
The EU also strongly condemned the harsh sentences and torture allegations at the OSCE and is discussing the matter at the UN Human Rights Council .
I am not aware of it .
I believe the EU budget is needed to provide long @-@ term term stability against the severe austerity measures which are being introduced by national governments in Europe .
It is not yet decided , but it is in the pipeline .
Amendment No 1 is key and needs to pass if the group line will be to support the report .
We know that , if we are going to be successful in implementing Lisbon fully - and this is what the report says - we need that sustainable funding in the next framework as well .
We all know that if the euro is to succeed in dealing with unemployment and falling living standards , it must be accompanied by policies for growth , job creation and investment .
We cannot pretend that these problems do not exist .
This has culmin@@ ated in the recent Ra@@ il Safety Directive and follows on from a long line of railway initiatives and reports taken by Parliament over many years .
Next time we will be discussing possible changes to the electoral vote .
We insist that the Commission and Council come forward in the near future with a proposal concerning the implemented regulation to ensure that the legitimate and genuine concerns raised by my colleagues - and in particular by Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten Ruijten - are taken on board and dealt with .
The report also underlines that EU rules contain the necessary guarantees for the proper management of EU agricultural and structural funds .
The global economic crisis , coupled with major shif@@ ts in world trade , has made many workers redundant in Ireland and across Europe .
I welcome today &amp; apos ; s oral question by Neil Parish , Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , because we want to see whether this regulation works .
We also need future decisions to be based on a thorough analysis of impacts .
If this House wishes to con@@ vert the EU from a customs union with political pre@@ tensions into a modern effective free trade area , it will have my full support .
Common social objectives , yes ; a common social model , no .
However , only one Member State has fully ratified the conventions and the related protocols signed in 1995 and 1997 on the protection of the European Communities &amp; apos ; financial interests and on fighting corruption .
The agreement on ethics reflects a careful and responsible balance .
Equally , none of us want to see , in a globalised world in which barriers have come down , Europe &amp; quot ; s chemical industry brought to its kne@@ es so that the regulation , which is a very fine one , ends up regulating an industry that has dis@@ appeared , to be replaced by industries across the world in China , India and elsewhere , where the regulation is far less good than it is today .
It is a pity that this is beginning to sound like a British debate , because a number of the issues here actually apply right across the European Union .
All I would say is that the EU has created a stable and prosperous continent .
They can assess the added value of such an initiative in the light of the current structures and existing international institutions .
If we want our economy to meet the future challenges , at some point we have got to make sure that the budget is aligned with the economic priorities of our citizens and of our business and of our workforce .
Mr President , I have reluctantly supported this resolution though do so having voted against the idea within it that a full blo@@ wn delegation of the Parliament be sent to view fire damage in various places .
Other countries outside the euro area are also facing very difficult times .
Community measures which protect the safety of the food supply require a sound scientific basis and the authority will provide this .
Thank you so much for your leadership during the presidency to get this through .
We criticise Turkey over the Additional Protocol - we have heard the same again this afternoon from the Presidency @-@ in in @-@ Office Office - yet no mention is made of the failure to implement the EU Council decision of 26 April 2004 .
This report is well worked out in its detail .
I think this is unrealistic .
I would like to mention the continuing campaign against discrimination , in the hope that real progress will be made on the European Gender Institute and on the recast equality directive .
This will allow us to drive forward the comprehensive reassessment of the EU &amp; quot ; s revenue and expenditure and sha@@ ke up the system in order to create momentum for adapting our political priorities .
I should like to thank Parliament for this valuable contribution .
- Madam President , before I begin , may I just pay tribute to the previous speaker , Jim All@@ ister .
First of all , with regard to the judicial and fundamental rights chapter where there appears to be a lot of difficulties concerning the negotiations : how best can we help Croatia to advance on that side of it ?
We all pay lip service to this - bearing in mind the referenda - but much greater practical application is required , in particular from the Member States , not simply from the institutions of the European Union itself .
However , the most important area which has been outlined during the Austrian Presidency has been one of realism , of doing things that are achievable , of not ignoring problems that are there and trying to build a consensus to try and solve them , as well as taking the sensible attitude that this cannot be solved just in six months .
If the final report of the observation mission concludes that there were serious flaws in the conduct of the election and makes recommendations as to how they can be prevented in the future , the Council and the Commission must act and both must be prepared to use sanctions in the fields of EU trade policy and donor aid to achieve this .
It is critical to involve young people because they will be dictating the success of the EU in future years .
Having said all that , however , I congratulate the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , thank him once again for his courtesy in responding so promptly to our request in June and wish him a successful six months .
Finally , on the eighth question - regarding coordination between the nine EU Member States that are members of the Bas@@ le Committee and the other European Union Member States - the European Union perspective is indeed strongly represented in the Bas@@ le Committee .
In our desire to help the environment , whilst at the same time reducing our dependence on imported fuels , we could use new energy crops to run all of our public transport in the European Union , if we so wished .
Having said that , I would like to say that the Commission remains open to discuss possible suggestions in this field , but only on the precondition that any proposed solution respect the fundamental aim of guaranteeing the safety of the products placed on the EU market .
This framework forms a solid basis for rigorous and fair negotiations with Turkey .
As the seeds thresholds for GMOs are based on the food labelling threshold , and as the labelling threshold will be discussed again in the next few months in Parliament during the second reading of the proposed GM food and feed regulation , the Commission will wait for the outcome of these discussions before proceeding with the question of GMO thresholds in seeds .
In this respect , we need to explore ways of setting up a Copenhagen Green Climate Fund .
We want to see these amended .
We must do our utmost to live up to their expectations and to prove that their belief in European integration will bear fruit and make Europe stronger as a whole .
Finally , in answer to the last speaker and regarding the concerns over paragraph 11 , I should say that the effective participation of minorities in public and political life is a precondition for good integration .
I have made my own enquiries about that but , again , I do not know what the timetable is .
This House does not have the right to draft legislation : that is the exclusive preserve of the Commission .
This is and will remain our number one objective .
The Habit@@ ats Directive , from which Natura 2000 deri@@ ves , seeks to establish a common framework for nature protection as though wildlife were subject to academic theory .
Migration will not go away : it is driven by the head@@ y co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il of despair and hope , it follows the law of supply and demand , but it has the capacity , if properly managed , to enrich and energise Europe .
It has been a very long time and this is one of the most difficult reports I have seen in twelve years in Parliament .
author . - Mr President , I know this is the last vote .
Although enlargement is one specific recommendation of the G@@ 10 , clearly our responses to each recommendation need to adequately reflect the changing environment within the European Union .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , on Northern Ireland , I would firstly like express my congratulations in relation to the new atmosphere and what I would describe as very positive expectations of gradual and sincere reconciliation and commitment to the shared values .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , honourable Members , my apologies for not standing up during my first intervention .
My group supported these amendments when the focus was on the substance but at this stage it is better to concentrate on the issue of whether the Commission or Council has implementing powers so that we in Parliament state loudly and in un@@ ison that our interests lie in backing the Commission .
He is an example to other Ministers for European Affairs who come to this Parliament as regards how best to engage and obtain Parliament &amp; apos ; s support .
It is intended to put forward a proposal for a directive to be adopted shortly after final agreement is reached in Bas@@ le by the middle of this year .
