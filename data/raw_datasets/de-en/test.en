Mr President , let me say to the honourable Member that the accession talks proceed from the principle that the candidate countries recognise the so-called called acquis communautaire , the established body of Community law and practice , which is non-negotiable negotiable , and that they will apply it from the moment of their accession .
Mr President , I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Simpson .
I do not even want to ask what the results of the questionnaire were when it came to the word &apos; deflation &apos; .
I think it is a good thing that so many proposals have been tabled .
The Kurdish question is inseparably linked to this democratization : it cannot be delegated to the military even though certain people both here and in Turkey would have us believe that the military is the guarantor of democracy and the rule of law .
It shows that he has at least been listening .
The extreme right in this House , namely , has the effrontery to make a speech here like the one just made by my colleague Mr Gollnisch .
Mr President , the question which is before us for discussion here is certainly a difficult one , and one and a half minutes is really only long enough to examine one aspect of it .
Mr President , thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to do so .
We want a workable system , and we have always said that .
We have been waiting for a response from the Council since April this year and that is why we believe this oral question is now necessary .
Above all , we are willing to give the Chinese people the assistance they need .
The enormous profits from speculation that have been and continue to be made and the increasingly unequal distribution of wealth and income in Europe are not being tackled .
Something I would like to do during the European Football Championships - which are not long away now and which will be hosted in Poland and Ukraine - is to watch one or two matches with you .
It is certainly hard to understand why the Council - which extended such a warm invitation a few days ago in Helsinki - denied the young people of Europe the funding which we considered necessary in the Conciliation Committee .
However , we must not forget that , in addition to the technological and police measures , we must also combat poverty , ignorance and prejudice in order to improve society &apos; s image of children and children &apos; s image of themselves and to offer help to the victims ; thus far , victim support has played too insignificant a role .
Mr President , Mr President-designate designate of the Commission , I shall be giving my approval to your Commission tomorrow .
In the final analysis , it covers the amendment by the Committee on Budgetary Control which you have been unable to deal with in your report .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . - Mr President , Madam Minister , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the first time , agricultural research is getting a chapter to itself within the context of support for research .
CMR substances , carcinogenic , mutagenic or reprotoxic substances have still not been removed from children &apos; s toys .
Hate goes against the European ethos , and egoism , protectionism and nationalism are the greatest enemies of the Community of the European Union .
The Kyoto Protocol has at least three instruments , of which you use only one , and , most of all , you violate the most important principle , one on which the international community has agreed , that the world at large should cut back on CO2 wherever this can be done most cheaply and quickly . It is quite clear , though , that what you are proposing here is European internal trade , which will not have any effect on anyone else , and will cost between EUR 20 and EUR 33 per ton of CO2 equivalent .
As a budget expert , I should like to add that the Committee on Budgets , as Barry Wynn pointed out , will contribute to a wide-ranging ranging discussion of this matter .
It has been said several times today in the various debates that without Russia a European security structure and a flourishing Europe would be inconceivable .
We must ensure that the precautionary principle gains acceptance , not least for budgetary reasons .
We need more projects which are supported by several ministries at once .
Turning now to the authorisation directive and my report .
No one would dispute the fact that families have the right to live together .
It is not out of any lack of commitment or of the necessary will ; what we lack is power , and what certain of the Member States lack is the will to back up words with deeds .
There may now be 1.7 million deracinated Iraqis in Iraq . By the end of 2007 , the UNHCR estimates this number could be 2.3 million .
That , Mr Bouwman , is why I cannot vote for your Amendment No 9 , as item 14 of our motion for a resolution states that we expect the directive to take as standards either the four EEVC tests or other methods offering at least equal or possibly better safeguards .
Once again ( as in the case of the ITER project ) , the EU has managed to delay a project for so long that the costs are impossible to estimate .
Those who deal with livestock and the foodstuffs that are derived from them need a lobby which , in the context of the continuing globalisation of food markets , can make a convincing case for their products and , above all , can protect them from misguided policies .
This is indeed scandalous , and I believe that the Commission , in the Lisbon process and elsewhere , must do much more . There is a need for more employment for women , and it must be one of the EU &quot; s most especial concerns to do more about childcare , in order to improve the situation as regards education and childcare .
We have many tasks ahead of us , and I am proud that Europe is able to cope with them !
Over and above that , we want enlargement to come about under conditions acceptable to all sides .
The second question concerns the part played in these consultations by genuine discussion of the macroeconomic policy options and by the presentation of a new policy mix for discussion , as requested by the European Parliament , a policy mix going beyond the tautological old argument that a sound economic policy will eventually lead to a sound employment policy .
How can we tell the Commission what initiatives we should like to see if we trim the own-initiative initiative reports down or do not take reports in a direction that improves things ?
The time has come for the Commission - and I call upon the Commissioner present to make a statement on this issue - to put an end to the conflicts surrounding the interpretation of this Directive , either by amending the Directive or adopting guidelines .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first I should like to thank the rapporteurs on behalf of the Commission for their excellent work .
We make up 8 % of the world &apos; s population .
It is costing the Council nothing but fine words !
We call on the Directorate-General General for Competition to continue to tackle the vertical concentration of the media and of production within the media and to do so with renewed vigour , just like it did at the start of this legislative period .
A point that is not mentioned is the fact that the EU is not alone in recognising the increased geostrategic significance of the Arctic .
The individual negotiations which we want to conduct with 12 applicant countries should not become mere routine .
A dramatic increase in the training figures in all fields of the health service is needed if we are to meet these demands .
Another point : what is the Commission doing to overcome varying national interpretations of Community law on the recovery of own resources , as described in Paragraph 7 ( 1 ) of its report ?
The Council is monitoring the humanitarian and social situation in Zimbabwe very closely .
I had already complained about this in committee vis Ã  vis the language services .
That is at the heart of what we have to do , and that is why , as we have said , these are not commercial services , and the services directive must therefore not apply to them .
Unclarified also is the question of how refugees should enter the EU and how they should be received there .
Monetary questions are questions of trust and this trust is shaken by the watering down of the Pact .
The PPE-DE DE Group approves Amendments Nos 1 to 5 but cannot support Amendment No 6 .
Nevertheless , we still have a great deal of crucial work to do over the next two weeks , which , above all , will hopefully take us in a direction that will allow us to launch this association agreement with the Andean Community .
Please research for yourselves !
I would even have gone further in a few places .
I would like to express my thanks to her and her colleagues , but also to Mr Lage , for their excellent cooperation .
In the technical field we can introduce more environmentally-friendly friendly technology for ships &apos; engines and specific terminals for express transhipment .
Mr President , I can entirely endorse the views expressed by my colleagues Mrs Mann and Mrs Schroedter .
Mr President , Commissioner , may I firstly say that I am sorry to hear that the Commissioner has a cold , which is hopefully real and not political , and that I hope he is soon feeling well enough to undertake the important trip that he would still like to go on this week .
Animal feed in the European Union must be safe and reliable for animals and humans .
( 4 ) With regard to the welcome rule on Internet scams , a few adjustments still need to be made in order to ensure a balance between consumer protection and the burdening of businesses .
Culture and cultural programmes are the soul of Europe , as everyone has said .
I believe that there is actually an urgent need for us to reopen the unfortunate discussions and debates which we held at European level after Rio and Kyoto , and which yielded no results .
Now even fewer people in Europe are safe from Franz-Hermann Hermann BrÃ¼ner !
That is what it is really about . So it is vital that we should not deceive ourselves .
By the time they , in their turn , intervene , the culprits are , as a rule , over the hills and far away .
The proposals on which Parliament has been consulted up to now under this right of initiative have not , on the whole , been very convincing - including an Austrian proposal that had both technical shortcomings and problems in terms of content .
However complicated the issues may be , the parties must grab the historic chance which they now have .
We need an education policy that makes the fullest possible use of this continent &quot; s reserves of education .
As shadow rapporteur for Lithuania , I was particularly pleased by the high degree of approval - over 91 % - in the referendum on accession to the EU , but also by the country &quot; s high level of economic growth in recent years , which alone has made it possible to raise the funding that is needed if the social problems of transformation are to be solved .
In organisational terms , I believe that it makes good sense to focus special support on a small number of aims .
When I see the Commissioner for Transport nodding , at the same time I also applaud the fact that you link transport and environmental policy , because these are important spheres .
These include energy and the fight against climate change , they include a functioning common foreign and security policy , and they also , of course , entail our countering the threats posed by terrorism and organised crime effectively without restricting human and civil rights in the process .
I am quite sure that , as part of your Presidency , you are planning further measures to increase mobility and thus job security .
Even the Federal Government once appealed against a patent which had been awarded by the Patent Office in 1999 .
Commissioner , I also emphasised in the various questions that the Commission acted appropriately on this matter .
However , a social clause is significantly more than what we find here in this text .
Mr President , on this Thursday , during this afternoon &apos; s topical and urgent debate , many of us here will obviously be delivering our final speeches on the subject of human rights .
Quick , efficient action is also expected by farmers since , in our country , in Belgium , well over 90 % of farmers are victims of this crisis .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - Madam President , the great majority of our group will be voting against this report .
The Americans , or perhaps I should say the American chemical and agricultural multinationals , are adopting an arrogant , nationalistic and insolent stance .
It also recommends that this decision should be forwarded to the Council and Commission .
Please allow me to ask a question . The problem with the Statement of Assurance lies in its shared management .
The people of Cuba must have freedom to choose their leaders , democracy , their parliamentary representatives , and their economic system .
I still remember very well how , in his last speech in this House , the Commissioner particularly praised the data protection aspects of the agreement .
Now to access to waters and stocks .
Parliament has , by a very large majority , taken a clear stand on emissions trading .
We are sure that he will lead the negotiations in the transitional period in which we currently find ourselves very well and with great self-assurance assurance .
It is also necessary to introduce a contractual clause that favours secure social progress and that is regarded with the same importance as the rules on competition in Europe .
And that is despotic behaviour .
Did not something similar happen in connection with BSE as well ?
I would claim that it has done that .
Perhaps I would have done certain things differently , but it is Hungary &apos; s right to do things as it sees fit .
On this point , I agree with Mr HudackÃ½ , who said that there should be no regulation in areas for which the nation states have jurisdiction .
Of course the Commission should also issue recommendations , for example in relation to reducing debt .
This is why I have put forward two amendments and I call upon Parliament to vote in favour of them .
And the Union did in fact provide extensive aid from the start and will continue to do so in future .
Our committee expressly welcomes the proposed Roadmap for Renewable Energy as an important contribution to the sustainable development of Europe .
First of all , I should like to express personal thanks to the President for the conscientious work he has done , and also for the constructive cooperation the two of us have enjoyed .
In contrast to Welsh and Basque , you would probably not have had to submit your speech beforehand .
Mr President , Commissioner , when the Commission tabled this proposal , I thought this must mean the implementation of Article 16 of the Water Framework Directive , the definition of priority hazardous substances .
It was in 2003 that the Commission established that the reduced rates of VAT were not being reflected in lower prices and that they had practically no perceptible influence on the employment situation .
We know that air travel is a danger , just as we know that railways are a relatively environmentally-friendly friendly system of transport .
We must join together in attempting to find solutions so that people no longer end up losing their lives in the Mediterranean .
For who sells the smugglers the tobacco and the millions of cigarettes tax free ?
What this is about is protecting the fleet and protection of resources , which are fundamental principles ; there can be no deviation from them and no softening-up up of them .
In the run-up up to the Intergovernmental Conference , special emphasis is being placed on the European Union &apos; s ability to function , which is in every sense pre-requisite requisite to the success of the European unification process .
Mr President , I would like to point out that it is , in principle , the Member States that are responsible for taking the action needed to forestall the flu pandemic that is being prophesied .
In my opinion , it merely papers over the conflict between the status quo , whose advocates would press on with the energy-based based economy , fuelled by the old energy mix of coal and nuclear power , and the strategy that we wanted , namely a radical change of course designed to cut resource consumption .
This means that we need an independent legal status for spouses .
I see them , though , more as an appeal to us to carry out our responsibilities in the future .
Since we could not vote before Monday on the resulting amendments and since you had specially authorised us to meet then , because the trialogue at which we negotiated the outcome with the Council only took place last week , the committee adopted the relevant amendments immediately after voting for the agreement .
Glued meat is meat which is glued together and sold as a high-quality quality product .
I have just one objection : why not divide up the bull premiums over a transitional period ?
Everything which is already on the market now , which you can see in any airport , from Elizabeth Arden to Ellen Betrix , all of this can continue to be sold and marketed .
Another point I consider important is that under its Special Coordinator , Erhard Bussek , the Stability Pact has taken a great many political initiatives .
We must be quite clear about this , because no one else , apart from this House , represents the interests of postal service users adequately .
It is up to us to do something , however , as we too can bring about certain changes in this respect . I should like to point out that it is often enough to change cost structures in certain sectors to minimise various practices or to put a stop to them altogether .
General objectives , such as transfers of technology , are of no use to effective evaluations of efficiency .
Further points are addressed : agents and brokers are important for greater competition in the financial services sector .
Mr President , anyone who knows this paradise in South-East East Asia as I do , having visited it several times in the last fifteen years , is bound to be appalled by the chronic supply shortages , the catastrophic infrastructural situation and the brutality of this highly repressive regime .
Not only is the entire female population denied access to education , but women are not allowed to take up independent work .
This is a good thing in our view , but at the rigorously guarded external borders of the European Union , particularly in the Mediterranean , thousands of people die every year when seeking sanctuary from persecution , poverty , natural disasters and wars .
Politically , we have had a rough ride , and it was for a long time unclear what , if anything , we could achieve in the course of preparations for this summit .
With the present decision , the European Judicial Network will be adapted to the developments that have taken place over recent years , and its relationship to Eurojust defined in more precise terms .
In support of this motion , it has to be said that particular attention has to be paid to coordinated and targeted measures as , with all due regard for the principle of subsidiarity , individual solutions will ultimately lead once again to distortions of competition .
Regional and local bodies play an important part in the labour market , among other areas , in that their superior grasp of local needs and obstacles gives them better proximity to jobseekers , and it is through them that the best ways of removing these obstacles may be found .
This report is intended to deal solely with the occupied territories .
In the eyes of the European public the new Commission will be a European government .
But the violations of human rights go further , and supporters of the Milosevic regime were not the only ones to trample human rights underfoot ; sadly , those whom NATO set out to defend are guilty of the same .
Nobody is indifferent to the public &apos; s opinion on enlargement .
But it will never be achieved if we only support one side , criticizing it mildly , perhaps , but not demanding the fundamental prerequisite of democracy , namely that all parties be allowed to take part in the elections on a basis of equal rights and opportunities .
As again became clear yesterday , however , political momentum is strong enough to carry us onwards to Copenhagen and make Copenhagen , too , a success .
One important area in which there is a need for action is that of agriculture .
It is in diversity that our wealth is to be found .
The Committee on Culture and Education had therefore proposed that the 790 band not be opened in the first instance , but unfortunately , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy did not follow our suggestion .
What specifically are you going to undertake to ensure that expenditure is dramatically reduced ?
I know you are preparing certain measures to finally make flying really safe throughout Europe .
But if he is interested in having a real debate here , then I would be pleased if he would support our Group &apos; s request to hold a debate on this subject in this House at the earliest opportunity .
Let us have an end to this .
It is not the political aspect which bothers me .
I am very struck by the way in which so many in this House find it so difficult to stand up for the rights of Christians and to speak up in their defence .
That is why I cannot understand why it was not made quite plain that the employment pact must be binding .
We expect the Commission to make it clear that it has a strong voice - including in dialogue with our partners .
The only way to remedy these weaknesses is by deciding to opt for conciliation here by a majority of 314 votes .
On the other hand , however , I have to say that my political thinking is governed by the principle that there must never be another war in the Middle East ; a lasting settlement will never be achieved by force .
We also hope that we shall be able to play an active part in the preparations for the intergovernmental panel on forests , particularly as regards the problems of trade and the environment , and I hope we shall achieve a sensible solution in that context .
If it were to be possible , for a joint effort , for example by way of the Quartet , to resolve the Middle East issue , that would take much of the wind out of terrorism &apos; s sails .
It is the subject of an excellent report by Mr RÃ¼big , whom I would expressly like to congratulate on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats . His report is thorough and precise ; it is creative and full of insights .
Measures can and should of course be planned for Famagusta , in order to make it suitable for habitation again , and you will be aware that relevant initiatives are underway in the town .
The EU must treat Ukraine as a genuine partner and give it clear messages .
I do not recall us ever coming to such a decision in plenary .
It is at those borders that the widest prosperity gaps are to be found , and it is there that the bulk of our work will have to be done .
No matter what sort of fundamentalism we are talking about , there is no room for it in Europe &quot; s civil society .
Regrettably , so far only 4 EU Member States have ratified the Convention and the Protocol .
As well as that , I am authorised to conduct negotiations relating to the agriculture sector , in the WTO for example .
Very often , it is the case that a lot is done by communities or regions , but unfortunately , not always with the support of the national government .
Gradually we are perhaps making a little progress , for only recently the German Bundestag made the cross-party party decision to move closer to this budgetization of the EDF , particularly with respect to an effective monitoring system .
In other words , not all the bureaucracy that arises in European projects originates from Brussels ; rather , it is the combined effect of processes at national and European level .
In one thing , sadly , we have not succeeded : we failed to get the necessary resources we proposed ; and we have not managed to get recycling , the reuse of unspent resources within cohesion policy .
There are now clear and realistic criteria for the development and marketing of alternative tests , so that Parliament can count this as one of its great triumphs , not only for animal welfare , but also for consumers .
Whether we like it or not , almost 50 % of the EU budget has to be spent on the maintenance of this agricultural policy .
I want to ask you , however , one more thing , namely that , when restructuring the Commission &apos; s work and policy in the Balkans ; you will really use , to the full , the imagination that I am sure you , Commissioner , and many of your colleagues possess .
It is very important that we clarify that what we are voting on is what was adopted in committee in the original German version .
I would like to reject the amendments on the internalisation of external costs because they have nothing to do with this report .
- Mr President , I should like to make it absolutely clear that I am not here to take the place of Mr Martin , but that my group has given me two minutes even though I am not a member of the committee responsible .
Such is our objective towards which we are journeying , and I am convinced that we can reach that objective providing that certain conditions are complied with .

The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Wednesday , 17 October , pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed .
We cannot accept seeing women and men still not having equal rights at the dawn of the 21st century , seeing the disabled socially marginalised , or people being excluded from society because of their sexual orientation and branded as different .
We need to achieve peace in the region and we need to support the peace efforts of the government there .
Let me repeat what the plenary said in the relevant report , namely that Parliament will regard that aspect of its position which refers to the creation of reserves for emergency situations as non-negotiable negotiable .
I very much support visa facilitation for businesspeople and students , just as you have said .
It is now up to the Council to agree on a common negotiating position for financing issues at the summit this week in Brussels , that is to say how much in the way of resources can be included in the European Union Budget for the new Member States as from 2004 .
I do not wish to encroach on members &apos; time , but you reported at the beginning that you are now instituting Treaty infringement proceedings against France .
In conclusion , allow me to say that the Belgian government has announced that it wishes to complete the preparations for the definitive Eurojust unit during its presidency .
It is not right for full employment to be de facto abandoned as a political objective and for everything , literally everything , to be subordinated to monetary stability .
There needs to be some central body to defend the public interest - which includes , and must in our view include , such things as climate protection - and Eurocontrol is probably better suited to doing that than the votes of industry alone , and industry &apos; s participation in this area can be ensured by other means .
Mr President , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , the human suffering in Afghanistan has lasted for decades and precludes a cynical approach to these deliberations , although such would be a very tempting option .
As you , Commissioner , will have seen from having read the new German Government &quot; s working agreement , two substantial paragraphs of which are devoted to securing the old age pension system , this has become no less important an issue in the years since the directive was drafted and adopted .
Mr Wiersma &apos; s report offers a number of suggestions .

The fact is that there are once again concentration camps and even mass graves in Kosovo .
Thirdly , the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly .
Tax rates of 50 % with a high standard of living and high levels of social services are not a coincidence .
It is not only wrong to demand too much of people ; it is also wrong to expect too little of them .
Although that is a permanent state of affairs , it threatens to escalate next weekend , even for those people who are entitled to enter Bosnia-Herzegovina Herzegovina under the laws of that country , because transit rights will be denied them too .
Madam President , Commissioner , you should have begun with the observation you made at the end .
In the case of a five-year year-old old ship , for example , half the subsidy must be repaid .
Consequently , the framework agreement - if we succeed in bringing about a very good one - will be a great step forward .
We should have made do with the country reports , adding at most a short , yet succinct resolution .
My justification for this is as follows . On 14 November we submitted a motion for a resolution to the administration .

Who imposes sanctions when they do not function ?
Then I should like to draw your attention to Amendment 6 to paragraph 31 .
I have two short supplementary questions .
May I also point out that I am asking for Amendment 6 not to be accepted , because otherwise this important directive would not come into force .
We will revisit this theme at a later stage .
The efforts of the Commission to make good the damage can be clearly recognized in the report .
We had requested a report on sickness absence for this year .
Secondly , third countries also need to be prevailed upon to adopt ILO model agreements .
What has come into being really is a compromise , and that is something I want to emphasise , since there are of course other opinions represented in our group , and I can tell the Commissioner that resistance to this policy at European level comes not only from the Member States but also from among the ranks of our group , that of the European People &quot; s Party .
There are signs of hope , and one of these hopeful signs is that Pope John Paul II is expected in Sarajevo next weekend - not for a Catholic ceremony , but as a sign of dialogue between cultures and religions .
We all need to weigh up the facts , but what standards should we apply ?
It must also , moreover , be apparent to us that opening up the Council &apos; s legislative process to the public can make a dramatic leap forward in terms of transparency .

This means , quite simply , that a common removals policy must form part of an EU immigration policy .
You can assume , Mr Sasi , as President-in in-Office Office of the Council , and Mr Lamy , as Commissioner , that in the position determined in our November resolution we will present ourselves as energetic and coherent both to you and to our partners in the Millennium Round .
I therefore agree fully with the view which you expressed , Mr President-in in-Office Office , and also the Commissioner . We must bring Russia back on board and we must succeed in persuading Russia to return to a cooperative approach .
I should also like to thank all my fellow Members , however , especially those who refused from the outset to support efforts to achieve a qualified majority at first reading , because a compromise is always harder to champion than an individual position .

On 13 April , Parliament decided by a majority to postpone the discharge and ask the Commission to supply further reports and information .
As the Commissioner has already said , it is unacceptable that passengers &apos; rights suddenly change when they cross the border from one country to another .
It makes no difference to me if it is called economic governance , the stability and growth policy , the competitiveness pact or a Commission recommendation on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey .
It is therefore all the more incomprehensible that the Commission wants to integrate , if not conceal , an investment agreement in this agreement to give undertakings a direct right to take legal action before a special arbitration court .

The directive now provides for a situation in which the risk borne by smaller suppliers and the costs incurred by them are reduced through the Commission &apos; s providing them with information concerning additional stipulations in the Member States .
That is a very significant step forward , in particular with regard to the involvement of Parliament , which goes beyond the terms of the treaty .
Parliament and the Council decided that this is how it should work , so as to ensure that the new director would be independent of the Commission .
Mr President , I thank you for the supportive and constructive debate .
In our follow-up up report we said we wanted to look in more detail at the following questions in particular , namely the question of evidence , so that evidence lawfully collected in one Member State can be admitted in another Member State , and the procedural guarantees for the accused , on which a special consultation is taking place on the basis of another Green Paper presented by my colleague Mr Vitorino .
I am pleased that the European Union and other international organisations , including NATO , have succeeded in shoring up the process , so that the reform course has not only continued but has actually improved and accelerated .
I was somewhat surprised to see how intently the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism considered and discussed the question of hand baggage .
It is to be hoped that the coordination of economic policies will at last actually create a favourable environment for all the actors .
The question always concerns the standards on which the tests will be based , as allegedly none of the 17 German reactors would be approved today , simply because the standards which applied when they were built do not meet current requirements .
The number of those who seek precise details on ingredients is relatively small , according to my research .
I have not been to the disaster zones and have only been in telephone contact , but many have told me that Mr Prodi &apos; s presence - and the humanity he personally embodied - enabled them for once to perceive the Commission and Europe in a quite new way , and not as the distant bureaucracy they had always thought it to be .
There is a backlog of commitments that he has inherited from the old Commission .
There is one suggestion in the Court of Auditors &apos; report that I particularly want to pick up on , one that will also be important in terms of the work done by the Committee on Budgetary Control , and that is the suggestion that the annual reports by the Directors-General General should include a specific position statement on which of the Court of Auditors &apos; recommendations have already been put into effect and which of them still require action to be taken .
The third point I would like to raise concerns the issue of how to enable employees to participate in a company &apos; s share capital without that company needing to bear the relatively high costs of launching a prospectus .
Because we consider that a fair sharing of the burden is an important aspect of asylum policy , we are also in favour of introducing all relevant measures just as for the Dublin Convention and Eurodac .
My question is : What actually is the situation where the Energy Community is concerned ?
This entails risks , and the troops must be instructed to take particular care in areas where these munitions have been deployed .
Mr President , Mr President of the Council - whom I address today in your capacity as President of the Council of Defence Ministers - Commissioner , I believe that the development of our foreign , security and defence policy has generally been extremely encouraging over the past year .
Among other things , appropriate funding must be provided for the European External Action Service .
I have to take issue with what Mr Sylla said .
You all have a note to that effect in the voting list .
However , my report also criticises the fact that the complex interaction of European legislation and national transposition has not resulted in a simplification and debureaucratisation of public procurement , as was , in fact , the aim of the 2004 revision , but rather in more work , high external costs for legal advice and protracted procedures .
What matters is whether we succeed in actually using the process of the UN Summit to reverse the trend of blind globalization and ideological globalism , and whether we succeed in steering towards social justice , ecological sustainability and democratic co-determination determination , even for those living in the poorer countries .
I am pleased that my fellow Members have put the brakes on the Commission &quot; s rationalisation pressure , or are set to do so , and have insisted on an increase in funding for PROGRESS .
Here low-cost cost countries , which are damaging the European economy on a massive scale , are apparently trying to secure sources of cheap raw materials and open up new outlets .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I too want to offer warm thanks to the rapporteur .
It is easy enough for the other States to go ahead cheerfully with adopting resolutions - they don &apos; t have to bear the consequences .
That may be just a point of criticism , but it is a decisive one .
Let us not forget that many authorities are , in part , self-financing financing .
It is crucial to have on-the the-spot spot checks .
Of course , I also have a few criticisms to make .
My group approves without qualification the support of sustainable energy sources in these countries , but the Altener budget will not cover it .
Apart from hoping to make progress in the matter of extending qualified majority voting , in truth we have not made a great deal of headway .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Reform Treaty realises three elements essential for the future of the European Union .
I hope at least that we as Members will derive some benefit from this .
To understand that , for example , is an enormous challenge .
They must also be clearly labelled , so that our citizens - who are always being described as responsible citizens - can also act accordingly .
There is , of course , exactly the same problem with limitation of the fishing effort .
We shall discuss this within the framework of the Ayala Sender report - when we shall also have time for the debate .
I should like to express my thanks to those of Michelin &apos; s employees who are here today .
I do not want to sound too discordant a note , but I do at least want to mention three problematic aspects that lead me to be somewhat dissatisfied with the report , despite the general approval it enjoys .
If you convey this message to the Council tomorrow , we will be on your side ; but we will only be on your side if you do so , Mr President !
Mr President , the same applies to me , I was present , but I am not in the Minutes either !
Any signal that we as the European Union give at this point is crucial .
Forty per cent potential savings is a great deal .
The lessons of our current structural policy could usefully be applied in Eastern Europe , and vice versa .
Moreover , these resources should be topped up to create other jobs in these regions besides those in tobacco production .
I remember well that when we expressed our support for Andrei Sakharov , Vytautas Landsbergis and other campaigners for civil rights , people said at the time : Please do not get involved . We will make use of the diplomatic channels and you are causing more harm than good .
The military have lost nothing there .
Time is passing too fast , not only the time I have to speak , but the time left to reform the CFP .
If we wish to keep to the timetable in the course of the German presidency , there are two conditions that have to be met .
We also have to acknowledge time and again that , as an economic and trading centre , Europe is in competition with the large economic and trading centres of America and South-East East Asia .
It can only be successful if we have binding climate policy objectives .
I find it a particularly good image because when two cogs mesh , they move something , and that is exactly what we want .
All in all , a middle way has been found .
The European Union is made up of States with very different standards of living .
Their internal structure has , however , not kept pace with this .
You made it clear to us on that occasion that it is objective facts that interest you , that your concern is with the matter in hand rather than with how to exploit a situation .
This concerns the designation E407 or E408 for treated eucheuma algae .
What we say we will do is always splendid , and the British Presidency &apos; s achievements have been outstanding , but now , in common with this House and also , I hope , with the Commission , Mr Santer , I have high expectations as regards the Cardiff Summit .
Hence I expect everyone there , be they Albanian or Serb , to leave the KFOR troops in peace .
I have to say to you , however , that I considered this provocation necessary .
Their structure and specialist technical knowledge mean that they are able to react quickly to any software problems that come up .
Thirdly : the voluntary undertaking by the motor industry , both in Europe and in Japan and Korea , refers to technical measures to reduce CO2 through better engines , lighter vehicles etc . That also needs to be monitored .
These things are true , yet there was no atmosphere of being watched , there were no visits from the secret police , as has been experienced by the rector of the Catholic University of Lviv and by young people involved in NGOs and opposition parties .
The European Union needs a legal personality .
The new regulation will clearly regulate the conditions and procedures for granting Community financial aid , which will provide the corresponding legal certainty , in particular , for the States and regions that plan such projects .
Around 86 % of those surveyed in the European Union said that they would like to know more before eating genetically modified food .
I voted against the resolution because I do not believe that the agreement can force countries to prohibit cluster munitions .
We have one result in South Korea .
This is a first step but , where cuts are concerned , there is an onus on the Commission and the Council to provide evidence line-by by-line line , whether it is genuinely the case that funds are not being drained away , or whether the intention is to block the politically desired priorities of Parliament .
Mr President , the Commission has submitted a promising work programme for the year 2000 .
I can confirm that the Secretary-General General of Parliament has provided all the information requested , as he did in April .
Some people will think that we have gone too far and others that we have not gone far enough .
I do hope , though , that the goes down well .
I am therefore delighted that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety adopted my amendments stating that all vitamins and minerals that are added to food must also be able to be absorbed by the body .
The package does , however , oblige the EU Commission to examine how matters stand in the market for occupational retirement provision in order to make it possible for other financial services providers too to come within the scope of this directive .
That is not good for the debate .
In spite of this , Commissioner , I am constantly aware of criticism that the programmes lack cost-effectiveness effectiveness because the application procedure for SMEs , no less , is too complicated , too bureaucratic and too protracted .
The Charter will be a safeguard , both for European citizens and for national institutions , and will be a central part of the system of checks and balances in our Union of law , because that is what makes us different from many other projects : we are a Union based on law .
The Castiglione report is an improvement on these proposals , which is why I have voted for it .
I also think that it is very important to worry not only about the health of the general population , but also to direct our attention to those people working in factories and workshops , and who come into contact with such substances .
Now if you would be so kind as to take your seat , that would ease the tension somewhat .
Basically , the great difficulty here is what to do .
Amendment No 13 is , I think , a very good one , as there is a need for the annual review of stocks that it proposes .
I therefore believe that the Treaty of Lisbon represents progress .
That is what it is about !
If we look around , at the Kosovo crisis , at the tension in Cyprus , and at the impasse in the Middle East , then we can only draw one conclusion , and that is how important it is to strengthen Europe from the centre , and that means accelerating from the centre and dynamizing the enlargement process .
Democracy also includes dialogue with civil society .
The report also criticises the fact that Austria has not yet ratified the 1998 European Charter for Minority Languages .
The information society relies less and less on material resources and energy , but far more on human know-how how .
The United States have had that for a long time now , because it is important for monetary policy and economic analysis to know how the various players are behaving .
I should also welcome further consideration of this matter by the Commission , since such a review would likewise help to improve company law .
It would , of course , be good if our committee &apos; s ongoing work were not to be prejudiced by the adoption of a resolution that had to be cobbled together within the space of three days , whereas we have been spending many weeks preparing a good document that , it is to be hoped , will enjoy broad support .
This is another instance in which , instead of signalling the beginning of new rounds of liberalisation , the Commission would do better to give more attention to the evaluation of what has been achieved so far .
That is why we are having this debate and will not be taking a decision until 24 March , in order to give the Council the chance to actually bring about that participation in reality .
That , Commissioner , should not be a problem either , since we have the same figure of 25 % in the port state control directive .
That is why we regret the fact - which has been mentioned by a number of speakers - that some important practical questions for Europe &apos; s future , in particular institutional questions , have been left unresolved for tactical reasons , and discussion of them has been postponed .
In this respect , it increasingly seems to me that anything in which the United Nations has a hand comes to nothing .
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0845 0845 / 2000 )
I think it highly important , Commissioner , that we should , in the years to come , not spend all our time speculating about who should hand over which documents to whom - if any at all - and estimates differ as to how great this agreement between Parliament and the Commission is .
I ask you : Is it really available 24 hours a day ?
The Commission is proposing a different set of budget headings from those to which we are so accustomed .
Only then are we strong enough in relation to the Council to be able to push through the things that we believe are essential .
If , secondly , we increase our support for science and environmentally friendly technologies , it will mean that Europe will remain a centre for innovation in the long term .
One hopes that all the politicians want to bring the work to completion and to find a compromise with which all parties can live , including on the composition of the Commission , with each Member State having one Commissioner who is entitled to vote .
Amendment No 2 clarifies that we expect the Member State to contribute towards the premises of local offices .
From the perspective of the turn of the millennium , we referred again and again to the apparent rationality of the market , to the risks for competition and possible cracks in globalisation .
If it were to fail , it would mean more than just the end of a great hope .
Yesterday , when the progress reports were presented , I heard not one word said about the under-representation representation of women .
I would have framed some of the points in the Hungarian constitution differently .
This is why the issue of an international criminal court is so important and so hard to achieve .
This should be looked at in more detail .
His report will be very useful to us in our deliberations which lead up to the granting of a discharge .
Furthermore , we have justified and still unresolved misgivings about the safety shortcomings of the Krsko atomic power station , which posed a genuine threat to the area around the Austrian border , especially during the struggle for independence .
I am convinced that a dialogue with Iran is , in fact , the only way to influence developments in that country .
I confess that I am now finding it difficult to keep to the subject I had actually planned to speak about , that is Mr Lehne &apos; s report on visa policy .
These need to be the priorities of our future policy on Cambodia .
The second condition was better matching of budgetary decisions and the Commission &apos; s work programme .
So I would expect a better response to our call for humanitarian aid to be authorized again if we managed to reach agreement with the current opposition , since it has managed to create a kind of political organization .
Please give your word .
Where is the willingness for real solidarity ?
We have also tried very hard to work out a compromise resolution with other groups , with a view to reaching such a compromise .
Here we have put forward for discussion the idea of a stability pact for the entire region .
The developments during the current Mercosur negotiations are causing me great concern in this respect .
The solution is a familiar one and it entails slimming down procedures and simplifying them to some extent .
Mr President , it is with great regret that the CDU / CSU group acknowledges the decision to grant Turkey candidate status .
We are not dealing here with a crisis in the European Union .
People are less aware of that case , but if we had needed a more spectacular example than Estonia , we got it there . We saw how a modern , network-driven driven economy suddenly became dependent on that factor , on that technology , how it was attacked and how its security really did come under very serious threat .
Every country is doing what it wants and using its own definitions .
We therefore call on the Commission to make it quite plain to Togo how that country is to conduct itself in the coming months , so that the people there may be in no doubt about what line we take .
Thirdly , the effect of this office is linked to its effectiveness among the public .
In future budgetary procedures - including the next one - we will ensure that citizens can see for themselves that dependability is guaranteed as one of our fundamental values .
Unfortunately , in school matters , the European Union is being restrained by the Member States , for any objective analysis of the problem quickly reveals how vital it is that the approach to different aspects of schooling be harmonised .
The latest cases of BSE will result in reduced production and will eclipse everything put in place hitherto .
Madam President , I voted against the Evans report because I believe that it was a very bad decision on the part of Parliament .
However , I cannot agree to Amendments Nos 22 and 31 in their current form because they implicitly say that no further controls need to be carried out .
Let me say clearly , just as other Members before me have done , that in my view a reference to the Charter in the Treaty is just as indispensable as a broad public debate with the people of the Union .
I warn you not to underestimate that point , because I believe that participation by Members will lead to better results in this case .
I believe that to make economic sense , and that it could make a very close relationship between the European Union and Russia irreversible .
Europe can only cover 50 % of its plasma needs .
As , I believe , an unregulated market cannot do other than result in adverse consequences for the environment , it naturally follows that investment in these areas would help to secure the ecological bases of our existence .
This case demonstrates that environmental protection is part of the acquis communautaire and is one of the conditions of entry to our European Union .
I also believe that Article 175 is the right one to use as a means of creating a suitable legal basis for this instrument .
It would have served both to protect the design and to create a market .
Our question to you is : Are you prepared to work with us on a vision of this kind ?
That is also why we have only submitted a very small number of proposals for amendments , because we can , of course , agree to this proposal .
This course of events is now recorded in the Minutes as follows .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like , on behalf of the Commission , to thank you very briefly for your many contributions , observations and suggestions during this discussion .
At that time , Altiero Spinelli made it expressly clear that it was above all the European Parliament that , being legitimised as a European institution by the direct suffrage of the citizens , had the vocation of pressing on with European integration and developing it further .
Our group has long favoured the first new countries &apos; being able to take part in the next European elections in 2004 , and rightly so .
I do not know whether it was or not .
Those countries need income from employment , and small enterprises and family businesses can help to provide that , and they need purchasing power for consumers .
If the Commission services responsible for transport and competition were to work together , we could take an important step forward in a policy to shift heavy traffic from the roads to the railways .
That is right and I am glad the President-in in-Office Office also sees it that way .
in writing . - Supporting the outermost regions of the European Union is in keeping with EU thinking on solidarity in order to reduce the disadvantages generated by their being difficult to access .
We suggest a cut in redeployment aid , aid for research and social aid , and I intend to be more specific here .
For this reason I hope that the Commission will accept our amendments and , with the support of Parliament , remove the obstacles to student mobility that still , unfortunately , exist .
That is not only good for the climate , it will also reduce accidents because 40 000 people die on Europe &apos; s roads every year .
Madam President-in in-Office Office of the Council , the open forum is no alternative to the convention .
Not until next year , you say , during the first half of the year , will the findings of the scientific committee be available .
We are in favour of women being given in this respect , once and for all , the freedom to choose , and of policymakers creating the conditions under which women will be able to do just that , particularly with regard to education , vocational training and equal pay for equal work .
This manipulation makes it clear to every last one of us that Serbia is not a constitutional state .
Some of this may even be listed as a receipt in the state &apos; s budget , but it is virtually unheard of for the people to benefit from it in the shape of infrastructure or health provision .
I cannot understand it , and the Koreans must be laughing up their sleeves .
Mr President , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , any German in this House will find it particularly difficult to talk about the forthcoming Council and the Stability and Growth Pact , for you know how hard the Germans found it to abandon the Deutschmark .
If we look at how things stand today , we see that the procedure for handing over suspects is now speedy , efficient and , as a matter of principle , reserved to independent courts .
Therefore , pursuant to Rule 129 , I request that you hold a vote on whether this report should be referred back to committee so that a discussion can take place there on how to proceed .
Is this some kind of hoax ?
Our responses are aimed directly at the most important causes of this very severe crisis .
The same applies to child protection , where there is certainly still much to be done .
At the time , the conduct of a number of Commissioners was unacceptable , discharge ought really not to have been granted , but , reasonably enough , we neither wanted nor were permitted to make scapegoats of the Commission as a whole .
Recent history shows us that , ever since the murder , in the seventies , of the German ambassador Graf Spreti , who was a diplomat and politician of note , this region of Central America has repeatedly found itself under the spotlight of European and German public opinion and was battered by one crisis after another , to which any response came too late .
The UN Security Council has endorsed the deployment of a UN-mandated mandated European force and the consequence is that the European Union is immediately under international scrutiny to determine what it is actually capable of achieving in foreign policy and military terms .
Firstly , Member States are wavering when it comes to implementing Community law provisions on residence rights .
At this point , I should particularly like to thank Mr Brok , who said what I , as President-in in-Office Office of the Council , tried to say in the Committee on Development , namely that it is of course not the Council &apos; s intention to curtail Parliament &apos; s rights .
I am pleased to note once again that our views are so similar where human rights , the principles of democracy and the rule of law are concerned .
Neither of them lost their bearings in dealing with this topic .
He has made the university into a local farmers &apos; club , they write .
Indeed , this is the legislative core element , if one may describe it thus , of the Small Business Act .
That decision did have an important impact on the outcome of the election in Germany .
I think that must be enough !
The European Union must provide support in this situation .
Firstly , I wish to explain why I did not include the principles of &apos; human security &apos; and &apos; responsibility to protect &apos; in my report .
For this reason I , too , submitted several amendments to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , designed to dismantle the bureaucratic devices which are so costly to business .
We have been arguing about Turkey since yesterday .
This means that if we in Europe get our act together in good time then we will also be competitive in this field of new technologies .
There are 35 million health workers worldwide , approximately 4 million of whom are in Germany , and well in excess of 12 million in the EU .
Bananas , hormones , steel , the US trade deficit , all these things make us nervous .
In striking a balance , I believe that the amendments proposed by this House generally offer acceptable solutions .
Yesterday , the President of the Commission gave a positive response to Stephen Hughes &apos; s request .
We just cannot say for certain .
The Council has not discussed this issue in terms of the aspect which has been mentioned by the honourable Member .
We have tried , by means of a very spontaneous action , and in view of the urgency of this matter , to make the views of this Parliament very clear to the Turkish Government , Parliament and to the human rights organisations .
The Commission is aware that , at the hearings about new financial assistance , Parliament had to react to very short deadlines .
The third reason why I voted against the resolution is that it rejects measures which are demonstrably usable in the fight against terrorism , namely the extension of passenger name records to Europe and a reinforcement of Europol .
In the long term too , they should also bear responsibility for deciding who should preside over them .
Even the Council has called on you to comment .
If you are not prepared to cross this bridge , then you yourself must bear responsibility for the consequences .
What we are dealing with here is the issue of sharing the burden of receiving refugees from civil wars .
I do understand that Mr Posselt and others are saying that we should act anyway , even if we do not keep to the Rules of Procedure .
However , it needs to be made clear who is to issue a warning and when , who is subsequently to take over responsibility for the warnings , and when the European Commission is to get involved .
A special thanks to you , Mrs Kaufmann , for your very good work in the Convention .
Annex XV remains in the Accession Treaties and will thus become primary legislation .
The few jobs which may be on offer depend on the goodwill of the parties .
With this in mind , we profoundly regret the terrorist attacks in Istanbul .
With its entry into the accession negotiations , Turkey entered into an agreement with the EU to comply with the Copenhagen criteria .
They should look at this and draw up their voting lists carefully with this in mind .
This can perhaps be improved when it is discussed in the Council .
In doing so , they are excluding themselves from the community of values that is the EU .
This has particularly affected the four cohesion countries - in the positive sense of course - as it has the five former East German LÃ¤nder .
There is another important problem , which is how to prevent the sick from being ostracized .
If the massive price reductions were implemented as planned hand in hand with extended quotas , the milk quota system would in fact be nullified .
There are other committees that have voted against ownership unbundling .
The indebtedness is therefore compounded .
Mr President , I have no desire to hold up proceedings , but , as this is the last vote at which Members will be present in large numbers , I would like , on behalf of my group - and , I take it , also on behalf of all Members of the House - to thank the services most warmly for preparing the difficult votes that we have had over the past year .
I believe that the increasing demand that is to be expected means that we need , first and foremost , a stable investment environment .
At the Luxembourg special summit led by Jean-Claude Claude Juncker the Essen procedure was improved by the establishment of guidelines and national action plans , which , my dear Wim van Velzen , must indeed become more verifiable !
In the family !
As we are such large institutions , we need buildings and they must be planned carefully and transparently .
Their function is to create transparency and promote communication .
Obviously , the Commission works in close liaison with individual national authorities in such cases .
The Inuits explained this during the consultation .
I am not satisfied with how the description of sustainable , fair and green growth from the Europe 2020 strategy has been represented in this work programme .
I also wish to refer to the amendments proposed by Mrs Ferrer , which seek more effective action against unfair practices by deploying every available means of protection laid down by international agreement .
But you can be quite sure that we will not let you air your unrepresentative and indefensible views in this forum .
For this reason we need an appropriate code of terminology for operational communications .
We made those reforms ourselves - and I am pleased to remind you about that here , because we had that very debate here in this Chamber .
I am absolutely outraged by what I have just heard said about the right to adopt being under attack .
Secondly , the Commission has considerable difficulties with Amendment No 21 on penalties .
That is why I would ask you for your support in tomorrow &apos; s vote so that we secure a broad majority in favour of progress in our European media policy .
However , what happens if a European citizen comes , with an organ , from a third country such as the Philippines ?
Of course children must be protected .
Let me also refer you specifically to paragraph 4 of our joint resolution .
The statistics provide no information on the extent to which the recorded increase in reported cases of domestic violence is related to the increased willingness of the victims to stand up for themselves or what proportion of these are immigrants .
We see that the stage is set for hydrogen vehicles to be ready for the market .
In Bosnia , we are now represented by a police mission .
This also has nothing to do with the European Rail Traffic Management System ( ERTMS ) .
Here in Europe , we agree on CO2 reduction , and then we conclude a stability pact ; those who fail to stick to their CO2 limits get criminal proceedings brought against them by the Commission .
The new Commission &quot; s work on this dossier has been first-rate rate , but little information and few explanations were provided when this 1 200-page page report was first put before the House . This meant that a very watered down and bleak version of the debate was presented over the following months by the other parties involved beyond the confines of this House .
In the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights Sir Leon Brittan likened the WTO talks to a poker game .
And , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , that means we are the only parliament that is taking the risk of adopting all the cruel decisions associated with Agenda 2000 before an election .
We need long-term term planning for the administration of the European Parliament .
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .
However , I would like to express my sincere thanks for the numerous signs of solidarity that I have since received in this House .
We shall continue to work with you on the implementation of major reforms too , with the aid of the substantial ENP Action Plan .
We are merely asking for cross-border border mergers not to be treated differently from domestic mergers .
On the other hand , however , the people of Europe are waiting to see what we think .
In this respect , I would like to point out that it is not in Europe &apos; s interest for the American carmakers to go under .
Parliament is not being involved , and no final decision is being taken .
Mr President , Mrs McIntosh , as I said earlier , one must first bear in mind that the question of animal protection is not solely the task of , or not solely regulated by , Community law , but that merely specific aspects of animal protection are regulated at Community level .
? and that the life of a Muslim in Chechnya is of equal value to the life of a Christian , a Jew , a Palestinian , a Hindu , a Buddhist or a person of no belief .
I would like to thank all the Members of the House who have contributed helpful proposals , suggestions , or criticisms to this or that aspect of this report , enabling us , overall , to come to a result with which we , together in this House , will be able to take a positive decision .
Since 2 p.m. today , foot-and and-mouth mouth disease may also have reached Germany and my home region of MÃ¼nsterland near the Dutch border .
The persistence and pervasiveness of racism , xenophobia and anti-Semitism Semitism in Europe are alarming and make it increasingly clear that action on a European scale is urgently needed .
There is also the question of the environment .
For a country such as the United States , which declares its support for freedom , the rule of law and proper court proceedings , GuantÃ¡namo is an anomaly .
We also have to check what level of protection is afforded to data that is transmitted .
Tomorrow , we will observe that we have , together , already achieved a series of important and expedient measures in this sector .
In my opinion , it calls into question some of the essential cornerstones of our economic system , such as free competition and the basic principles of the social market economy .
This issue is not just about a principle . In my view , it is about new funding sources and safe , clean but also efficient mobility at the European level .
In such circumstances , independent economic growth becomes all but impossible , and this is why we need a comprehensive debt relief initiative .
We need to address all these questions in our interinstitutional working party .
As chairman of the committee , I asked the rapporteur to proceed , as I said , by proposing an amendment about the disabled , but to refer the rest of all of it to the technical bodies .
The quality of bathing water is to be ascertained on the basis of changes over the past three years and no longer on the basis of one single year , so one-off off eventualities - such as poor weather conditions - will be less markedly apparent .
K9 has demonstrated its total inadequacy and is now the subject of discussions in the negotiations of the Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr President , production in the European Union has grown by just over 3 % per year in the last few years .
In Germany an entire branch is currently being brought into disrepute by the use of this term , which is ruining not just that branch but also the net product chain including its modern technologies .
It seems to be well prepared .
As you know , we are not at odds about the next steps in this matter .
From past experience , however , producing such a detailed document describing the best available technologies takes two years on average .
I would like to highlight another point .
Second , the European public are right to demand that their health be given top priority .
We must unreservedly guarantee basic principles such as the requirement that the cultural diversity of the media be protected in order to maintain freedom of expression , diversity of opinion and pluralism , creativity and the right to free access to information .
So ratification of the partnership and cooperation agreements ( PCAs ) should be made conditional on a number of criteria , such as respect for human rights and the principles of democracy and also the willingness to endorse the Council of Europe convention .
This is one of the priorities of regional policy , which is also implemented in the form of tailor-made made proposals in several of the roughly 400 programmes that I referred to earlier .
The relevant criteria do not exist .
But , as I said , if that is too specific to answer now , you can also let me have a written reply .
Madam President , we have an amendment before us which allegedly sums up the substance of two observations by the Court of Auditors very concisely .
Thank you for the debate , and I hope that the vote , which is about to take place , will go well .
He has not spelled out how , as the leader of an alliance of democratic forces , he envisages the transition to democracy , nor how he intends to set about holding the first democratic elections in a country beset by geographical and ethnic problems on such a scale .
We in Parliament will , of course , do so .
Thirdly , the agreement contains a series of terms allowing for the sustainable management of Mauritanian fish stocks and the development of the local economy .
Not having enough time available to me , though , I do not propose to do so .
For the most part these businesses have little equity capital .
The area which we are discussing is not important just for the regions ; it is also a very important area for the European budget .
The Indian Government has deployed a number of units of the army in an attempt to send out a clear signal to the world community that it is willing to end the violence .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it will be an important step in the right direction when we vote on the transparency register tomorrow , but no doubt this will not be the last word on the matter .
Mr Bach believes it would be enough to investigate this thoroughly and to introduce better safety mechanisms .
In cases which concern human rights , we will always intervene , in particular with regard to a partner as important as Ukraine .
Despite the fact that new oil reserves are still being discovered , word should have got around by now that this substance is finite .
I should like , if I may , to comment on a question which divides the House .
We must reach the situation in which legislation generally makes a clear distinction , as Alexandre Lamfalussy proposed , between the Parliament and the Council &apos; s intentions as joint legislators and the small print of the technical details .
The Commission proposed the full liberalisation of cross-border border mail . We in the reporting committee agreed on a compromise , namely that the same weight ceiling should apply to cross-border border mail and national mail .
That is logical .
The Commission undertakes to implement this programme strictly as Parliament intended .
I am therefore saying today , quite openly too , that I should like to have heard the speech you made today before now .
Therefore there is a need for a European directive .
But it was not long ago that this way of thinking prevailed .
The Greek Foreign Minister Papandreou yesterday said at the University of Istanbul , &quot; We want Turkey in the European Union right now ! &quot;
It is not we but our children who will have to pay the price .
It is lamentable that Parliament has bowed to pressure from the USA and , above all , pressure exerted by the major software companies .
Where is the passion that we once had ?
One of these can be found in the Green Paper where it talks almost exclusively of consumers .
Therefore , it would be better if the cabotage restriction could be lifted altogether sooner rather than later .
The Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left supports this motion , although we are aware that it is intended as a very short-term term measure and can only constitute a first step , but a step which should be taken immediately .
The same applies to the appointment of the staff and the filling of important positions within the service .
But we here in the European Parliament were elected - directly elected - by the citizens of the European Union .
- Madam President , I cannot but endorse the rapporteur &quot; s view , as Europe needs more fiscal competition rather than less of it .
They require strong political will , great determination and also great skill .
I would just like to point out that the media interests of the SPD in their present form are the result of the restitution of the German media after its expropriation by the Nazis and by the Communists in the GDR .
Mrs Jensen , it is our stated goal in the next programme period to thematically tie in structural policy - insofar as it is affected , in any case - with the Europe 2020 strategy .
We must not forget that the issue of liability is not a question of one-sided sided apportioning of blame .
In the Commission &apos; s view , however , there is no justification for an unlimited derogation for the further sale of new mercury barometers to consumers .
It is a similar story with the product assessment of occupational retirement provision systems , the second pillar of the pension system .
Obviously we all consider market power and processes of concentration to be damaging .
I would have liked to have seen greater commitment from the Commission in this respect .
On the one hand , you say - indeed , you complain - that we do not yet wish to apply external costs .
I find that scandalous .
Mr Pirker , on the other hand , is an example of someone quite capable of maintaining all his aggressive prejudices despite being in possession of the facts .
Moreover , the Commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products . This , too , has come to nothing .
Mr Rocard &apos; s proposals represent a significant component of a European policy on employment .
Sometimes this provides fresh impetus and then it should benefit everyone .
People want ethical standards in production ; they also want ecological standards in production .
It is also particularly important that the Agency should enjoy a problem-free free working relationship with the local delegation in Macedonia , where elections are due to be held on 15 September .
You can be assured that the Council will not avoid this subject in its dealings with Russia - we have just had a debate on human rights , and there will be other opportunities for this .
I am sorry , but it has to be said .
If we begin to do so , we will be opening the door not just to financing promotional activities but also , as Mr Santini said , to subsidizing and supporting exports ; for that is the next step .
The Legislative Council urgently needs this public character .
We have different models of how the relationship between church and state has developed .
Just now , Mr Coelho referred to an issue , one that has also been mentioned by others , including Mrs Vergiat , which has given us much food for thought .
A number of our amendments , also tabled by our group , were accepted by a majority in committee .
It is important that we are committed to innovation , to sustainability , to energy efficiency and to exploiting the potential of smart green technologies for the European economy and for safeguarding jobs in a competitive global environment .
I am confident that the solution that has now been produced and on which Magna , too , is working , and which involves many other European States , can be implemented .
Following a transitional period , a tariff of EUR 275 per tonne is to be introduced for bananas from third countries , from which bananas from ACP countries would be exempt .
However , the system does have weak points and it needs to be updated regularly .
All this not only benefits the EU &apos; s citizens , but also the refugees , who then know exactly where they stand .
A special relationship , or perhaps a too poorly defined relationship , exists between the Commission , the Commission officials , the buildings , the documents in the possession of the Commission and the other European institutions on the one hand , and the individual national judicial authorities on the other - and obviously only national judicial authorities can consider the case .
Allow me to say something about the necessity of amendments to the treaty .
We must take that more seriously in future .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this report is extremely important in economic terms .
I am quite certain , however , that this will also make a great impression on you and that it will also be clear to you that a very large proportion of the European population backs this request .
A further reason why we can support the compromise struck in the committee on compensation levels is because we think it is important for consumers to benefit from these improved and binding rules as quickly as possible and not have to wait for them for years because the legislation is , as is so often the case , still sitting in the Council .
Producers and consumers have the same objective , we are all in the same boat , so it is not just consumers that are affected but the producers themselves as well .
It is responsible because it has tried to revoke this compromise , in one of the poorest countries in Europe .
Above all , I would like to stress once again that there is enough money in principle , at least for the time being .
Our secret hope is that the proposed amendments improve the implementation of the cofinanced programmes on the eradication of animal diseases .
According to a recent report in the , many of the statesmen of major countries - SchrÃ¶der , Chirac , Blair - can be expected to stand down in the next few years .
But what is the situation regarding minimum standards ?
This indigenous supply does not offer an adequate prospect for the future .
Farmers &quot; wives do unpaid work at home , on the farm and for the family in exactly the same way as all women work in addition to the time they spend doing a job , but statistics take no account of what they do ; it is still not taken seriously by society , and is not recognised as an economic factor .
We need clear areas of responsibility .
Today is the second time .
The dialogue was launched in September 2002 .
That is why we set out quite clearly in the new strategy what objectives we want to achieve through this closer involvement : genuine support for reforms in the field of human rights , democracy , support for economic development , investment support , protection of the environment , environmental sustainability , development of energy and transport links , as also measures to tackle common challenges such as drugs trafficking .
The issues of climate change , energy policy , the financial crisis , drug trafficking and so on have been mentioned .
I respect and hold in high regard those Muslims , in particular , who , in Austria and elsewhere , have made their protest in a clear but peaceful manner .
We are not good little lambs !
I believe the Brenner base-level level project is one of the most important European projects that need tackling , with a view to making north-south south traffic environment-friendly friendly and efficient .
There can be no democracy without transparency .
However , we must not run the risk of this coverage against income crises taking us back to the old system of guaranteed incomes via state intervention .
We should not , because of superficial party interests , fail to recognise the wider importance of our democratic and constitutional system , and we should join forces against any form of violence , whichever side it comes from , from the extreme right or the extreme left , as an act of democratic solidarity .
It is with this in mind that the joint motion for a resolution expresses not merely a pious wish , but an appeal to all the institutions of the European Union .
In this context , we need legal certainty and , therefore , an extension of the monopoly over a longer period .
As long as we do not know that for certain , we do not need to worry about the limitation of scope , for it is of course the case that small and medium-sized sized enterprises live from markets that are as transparent as possible and that they find easiest to access , and if the WTO member states reduce the scope by a quarter , I do not know whether small and medium-sized sized businesses actually derive any benefit from that .
Then we need to talk straight to Iran .
The Community has an obligation to function as a role model in the international arena .
We would like to see these examples collected from all countries and the abolition of the gulf between the legal position with regard to equality of opportunity - as found , for example , in the European treaties , as Article 3 once more confirms - and the discrimination that actually goes on from day to day .
Older workers are prevented from going on to further education and training courses ; they are also prevented from acquiring new technical skills even though they would be capable of doing so .
Nevertheless , it is not as easy as paragraphs 2 , 10 and 13 of this resolution suggest .
There has been an exchange of letters on this subject between your House and the Council .
Is acquittal of the Commission by Parliament justified ?
Is there a right to life-long long health ?
No one should see this report as a means of impeding or preventing the accession of new Member States .
Great Britain , Germany and Spain have done this , and incidentally , all three were pressured by social democrats and socialists , and the other Member States have not .
I can understand why service providers and regulators are to be separated , but I am opposed to the option contemplated of destroying the hitherto integrated air traffic control system by awarding individual contracts , some of them to operators in the private sector .
Does that right extend to Scientologists or members of right-wing wing extremist groups ?
We ought to talk about him as well !
Secondly , it is clear see that Heading 4 is chronically under-funded funded .
It follows that , in principle , it is out of the question for a Member State to withdraw or resign .
We have had five wasted years in which we wanted everything and achieved nothing , and now Europe must come to a decision .
I would be very glad if you could dispel my suspicion .
In order that the exception does not become the rule , the Commission must monitor the action plans under consideration and compliance with the limits and sanction the failure to transpose them .
To make it worse , younger and younger women are contracting the disease : just in the last few years , the number of women under 40 affected has doubled .
It is therefore essential that the UN peacekeeping units and civilian police remain in the country until East Timor is able to take over these security tasks itself .
How , then , do you propose to stimulate domestic demand ?
Nevertheless , we must tell them most emphatically that the conditions in their prisons , especially for young offenders , will do nothing to improve the situation but can only breed more crime , drug abuse and corruption .
Strict processing regulations , by which I specifically mean rules governing sterilisation and the destruction of potential pathogens , and firm European regulations on traceability and control are indispensable and reduce the risk of the spread of epizootic diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever .
If I may interpret this as a suggestion that all 25 or 27 countries should , in future , still be able to compete in the European Football Championships , then I , as an Austrian , can only welcome that , because then we would finally be able to participate again .
You talked about comitology as if it were the holy of holies , as if it were our primary objective !
It is a delicate flower and we all want it to be a success .
Mr President , as a neighbouring state , Moldavia is a sort of foster child to us .
What if they were to refuse to pay the tax ?
Madam President , you came , Mrs Schreyer , to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , you presented your arguments there , and you were met with respect .
Currently , the transfer of a company &apos; s seat involves administrative obstacles , costs and social consequences and fails to offer the necessary legal certainty to shareholders , creditors or workers .
Furthermore , the consumer policy aspects are also highly important .
As we see it , retaining minimum rates is part of the idea that there is a need for minimum criteria in the field of taxation too , if tax is not to become a factor which distorts the market .
My fifth point has to do with an issue that has started to worry me in recent years , and that is whether the EUFOR troops have been advised about the problems with trafficking in women and forced prostitution .
I will deliberately emphasise that this must be quick and , indeed , immediate .
In our discussions , we often overlook the fact that Russia is the largest country in Europe in terms of population and that , even though it is no longer a superpower comparable to the USA , it nevertheless remains in point of fact the most powerful country in Europe .
Secondly , we need an effective instrument .
As you indicated , Berisha is exploiting the situation in Kosovo to the hilt in order to destabilise the situation in Albania too .
This cross-group group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions , which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy , transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .
We must think on a European level , but act on a regional level .
We need a framework for the building site so that these building blocks will fit together and a sensible structure will result .
In terms of the number of animals culled , the course taken by foot and mouth disease in the European Union in 2001 made it , no doubt , the most serious outbreak ever .
Personally , I see it as an historic necessity and opportunity , which must not be put at risk either by rashness , undemocratic procedures , and bureaucratic or national small-mindedness mindedness , or politicians &apos; lack of consideration for the social dimension .
In that respect let me point out that in December 1998 the then presidency of the Council distributed the Amnesty International report referred to by Ms Oddy to the CFSP Working Party on Human Rights .
What we need in order to raise the level of taxpayer honesty and increase tax revenue is not only efficient monitoring and effective cooperation by the tax authorities , but also comprehensible and simpler legal texts as a fundamental precondition for this .
Of course we will not manage to get hold of it by breaking in with a crowbar - that would indeed be silly - but we shall have to liberate it and use it for purposes compatible with the aim of stabilisation in the euro zone , perhaps in the framework of the European Investment Bank .
We should , however , strive for a closer link between representing the interests of those members of the public who turn to their MEPs , and the work of your own institution , enabling us to make a better and more efficient job of handling their concerns .
I also hope that the conditions attached to the establishment of 400 additional service posts within the Commission will actually be fulfilled .
However , a secondary aspect is that it also contributes significantly to simplifying the law .
We need to carry out a great deal more research in this regard and see what can be done in the way of prevention .
Such an article would also have an effect on the Community &apos; s competition rules and regulations , and also on the subsidy regulations , and in contrast to EU policy , which is based on opening up markets and privatization , this is the establishment of monopolies and preferential treatment of public companies , which cannot be in the interests of Europe .
Do we have to bow to a power simply because it is larger ?
He is convinced that our intervention in particular played a significant role in securing his release .
The Structural Funds are an expression of European solidarity .
It was established in 2002 when the floods happened .
We have heard bellyaching from the left of this House that there is a risk of inflation .
The Moldavian Government has refused to meet representatives of Transdnistria since last summer and a bitter fight is waging over border controls in which Ukraine has also been caught up .
Our aim , from which we must not be deflected , must be to preserve the unity of the institutions .
Where there are sellers there are also buyers .
I hope , however , that in our overall view of the situation , we are coming to a common way to proceed .
This means that the al ? Qa &apos; ida network and the Taliban militias still have large reserves of finance at their disposal , derived from the cultivation and sale of opium .
We want a competent , democratic Russia , but we also believe that what is happening today in Chechnya is a disgrace for Russia and a disgrace for Europe .
I do not think they will be clamouring to be the first to use the UMTS equipment .
It is quite interesting , by the way , to observe how the initial American euphoria which greeted the recommendation that Turkey should indeed become part of the Union has waned somewhat , because the United States of America is now no longer certain whether it really wants to see the European Union strengthened in this way by the addition of an independent Turkey that thinks and acts for itself ; be that as it may , if Turkey does accede to the European Union , it will have to shed some of its nationalism .
I know from experience how much work is involved in bringing a framework programme to a conclusion , at least in draft form .
The few good points to be found in the KEDO programme , namely the desire to arrive at an alternative form of energy and to make a contribution to North Korea in terms of promoting reconciliation or improving people &apos; s living standards , are swamped by a whole series of points which Mr Tindemans presents in detail in his explanatory statement .
During the process of reducing public debt , we must pay much more attention to fairness than we have done so far .
But because of the scientific committee &apos; s opposition , we could not simply authorize it .
It even still welcomes the introduction of common border controls .
That is why I , as a member of the Committee on Budgets , should like to suggest to the Commission that a precise financial framework for the development of this system is long overdue , because when the time comes we shall need the proper hardware , software and mainframes .
In individual cases , however , we may use different methods and arenas to achieve the goals of the neighbourhood policy .
It requires and encourages a sense of responsibility among all citizens . It puts the common good before self-interest interest and it uses property in the service of the community , without which it cannot be guaranteed .
The consequence will be secondary migration and abuse .
The Akayev regime collapsed without any outside intervention , as a result of a spontaneous popular uprising .
The second concerns the importance of integrating the Roma and the third is the European significance of the Hungarian revolution .
We do not need vox pops !
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at the end of a long list of speakers , including many from my group , it is up to me to say something new .
I would like to take the opportunity of my speech today to make it clear that the Stability and Growth Pact has played a part in the success of the euro and of the ECB , and that we resist all attempts at reinterpreting and nullifying the Stability and Growth Pact , which arise from short-sighted sighted opportunism in response to day-to to-day day political events ; the aftermath of enlargement will call for further structural and other reforms in politics and in the ECB .
Or is that not lucrative enough ?
That in our opinion means that we must not disregard this model completely .
In order to defend its interests and values , and those of other communities and countries , the EU must find a way , within its own institutions and within the international bodies concerned , to achieve an immediate and appropriate prohibition on the use of driftnets , and at the same time come up with the necessary effective control measures .
I refer in particular to travel costs for officials on active service , another problem which requires an urgent solution , and all the other points which , in my view , we solved at first reading and which we can now clear up once and for all .
If there are specific complaints , we should investigate them .
Do not misunderstand me : the Committee on Budgets takes the view that the EUR 154 million constitutes the minimum that should be allocated to the EMSA to enable it to cope with its additional functions .
Here , too , previous reports have addressed important issues .
The Protocol to the EU-Angola Angola fisheries agreement , as mentioned , already expired on 2 May this year .
Mr President , Madam President-in in-Office Office , Commissioner Barnier , many MEPs in this House are critical of the Treaty of Nice .
It is our view that the family is definitely a matter which the European Union is competent to deal with politically at European level .
It is therefore highly unlikely that imports will rise , because the price of agricultural raw materials used by the chemical industry will , de facto , be reduced to world market prices , that is , free-port port prices in the Union .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased and moved to welcome here today Mahmud Abbas , the President of the Palestinian National Authority .
What is important here are reasonable costs and a high degree of safety .
Even if an impact assessment reveals that a new proposal will entail costs for the economy or for citizens , this does not necessarily mean that the measure will be shelved , for there are some things which are more important than costs .
The new draft represents a huge restriction on the principles of subsidiarity and multi-level level governance , which is in contradiction to the Lisbon strategy .
A hearing before a Select Committee of the British House of Commons was also presented predominantly with arguments in favour of international exhaustion .
If , though , we take them seriously , more must in future be made available from the European Budget for such investments in the future as research , education and innovation .
This is intended to bring together the various competences of national bodies so that they can closely cooperate with similarly structured authorities in other states .
I was told that there are only written declarations in the case of second readings .
I would like to give the example of a case on which I do not think a decision has been made by the European Court of Justice , and where payment has been delayed by about a year now .
It is about protection for religious minorities and the obligation of every state to protect to the best of its ability the members of those religious minorities which are under threat .
That cannot be altered now .
The other is that we consider it to be a group &apos; s legitimate parliamentary right to table amendments to be voted on in plenary .
The sportsmen and -women who operate these boats are also keen to have the best possible boats , so the switch to a new generation of craft certainly has to be in all our interests .
The terms on which data is exchanged must therefore also be set at a particularly high level , since it is not just a matter of specific agreements with Australia and the US ; a number of other countries such as Korea and India also already want to have PNR agreements with us .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Social Democrats , we have never had the least doubt that we would only be giving our partial support to the Council &apos; s common position on the Fifth Framework Programme for Research .
The increase in the average global temperature is already having an impact in many parts of the world .
There are three things we must hold to . Firstly , randomly selecting groups of people in order to collect personal information about them is unlawful , both generally and under the Italian Constitution .
We must now make sure that this legal text is implemented as swiftly as possible in the Member States , and even more importantly - as has already been said today - we must ensure that the relevant national legislation and regulations are applied correctly at local level .
The population is suffering from the civil war , which has lasted nearly 20 years , with catastrophic economic results , and it is suffering under the self-aggrandisement aggrandisement and lack of human respect of the Civil War Party .
For there is one thing that must be clear to us , which is that for the 16th time in succession the European Court of Auditors has not given a positive statement .
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , we had a discussion with Mr Blokland , and came to a broad agreement .
This is an important discussion .
If we take the standard in the fifteen-Member Member State EU as 100 , the enlargement to 25 Member States reduced our productivity per worker to 93 , while work productivity in the USA stands at 121 .
At present , there are just over 200 million cars registered in the countries of the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to put four questions to this Chamber .
I would just remind you that the USA is conducting a war in Iraq with a range of allies , also partly because of energy issues .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , over the last few months , we have examined the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector in great detail and have held intensive and controversial discussions , not only with the Commission , but with all those who are in favour of total liberalisation of the sugar market .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , may I begin by saying a few words to the last speaker .
Another cause of the crisis is a globalisation concept that has made complete deregulation its highest priority .
The reality is that these decisions are taken under completely different conditions and in a completely different place .
Because what we need is food controls ...
If this House really wants to be the assembly representing Europe &quot; s citizens , it will now have to send out a clear message , as a vast majority of the public - as we all know - is opposed to Turkey joining the EU .
Mr President , we have of course made some decisions about the electricity part that mean we now have to be careful not to contradict the gas part too much .
They must also be able to identify who bears responsibility for political decisions and who does not .
In essence , it is up to the Member States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the framework decision on certain procedural rights in criminal proceedings within the European Union , which we are discussing today , is - according to the Council - to be limited to cases in which the European Arrest Warrant applies .
We should all pull together and the Commission should certainly take the lead in this .
Our former enthusiasm for legislation has left us with plenty of places where we can do this , and so it is a good thing that the European Commission has set in motion a major programme of cutting through the thickets of legal verbiage that we have at present and simplifying European law .
Like the rapporteur , I firmly believe - and I say this as vice-chairman chairman of the Committee on Regional Development - that many Member States are not fully aware of the significance and use of the European Social Fund and other structural funds as instruments in the pursuit of lifelong learning .
That is absolutely the right strategy , but your proposal , Mr Rehn , does not include any specific measures for bringing this about .
The Foreign Ministers are off trotting the globe , which I have nothing against , after all it is their job ; but , at the same time , they are also responsible for European affairs .
I expect that we will need to add to or amend the contents during the implementation process over the next two to five years .
Girls and women cannot train in these countries , are prevented from participating by dress codes , often threatened by fundamentalist groups and of course not nominated .
I was first elected to this Parliament in 1994 .
What I am expecting from you here is a clear timetable and a clear statement as to when these legal decisions are to be taken .
I am sure that this is what the constituents of all the Members of this House want .
I believe we have a good chance of ensuring that we win broad support for this important piece of comitology .
As no one wishes to speak against the motion , we shall pass to the vote .
At the same time , however , everyone wants to have these low-cost cost products .
However , the truth is that the population does also - and my fellow Member mentioned this just now - see negative sides to the euro .
If we simply wave this approval through , we will be encouraging a situation where soon , enhanced cooperation will be the only mechanism for reaching agreement because it is too difficult to reach agreement at Council level .
- Mr President , I want to raise a point of order .
Animal testing should be carried out only in the absence of any alternatives .
However , it is also evident that unilateral action by individual countries is a mistake .
In terms of volume , commitments , i.e. sums that will need to be converted to payments in later years , were around EUR 71 billion at the end of 1999 .
My second question is this : are there any other European Union ambassadors over there ?
In the end , we have voted as a unit against the resolution .
I hope that you will accept the bet and then in four years &apos; time we will discuss the next liberalisation step and we will actually talk about unbundling .
What I would like you to tell me , since you are responsible for science and for the Joint Research Centre , is the following : what progress has been made on work to develop an analysis method that can be used throughout the Union to test for genetic modification of DNA , and to what extent is the Joint Research Centre involved with this work , given that it has already developed analysis methods for a whole string of food products using ring tests , thus ensuring uniformity within the Union , rather than leaving things to chance ?
There has been a lot of talk in the past few days about the setting up of citizens &quot; forums to address the crisis situation in Europe .
Why does anyone leave their homeland ?
I have obtained the minutes of the debate on 13 December 1995 .
The EU can decide whether it wants to be a good example or a poor one .
I therefore do not see his activity in this case as a positive and I have therefore voted against this report .
It is for these reasons that we have to make it clear that we , the European Union , have to make a fresh start , and it is perhaps not right that you , Mr Solana , are going there to play for high stakes in a week &apos; s time , followed by the American representative the week after .
It is not a question of agricultural policy alone .
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible .
The manufacturers of herbal medicinal products must provide evidence of their safety in the same way as is required for chemical medicinal products .
That old appliances must be managed and also paid for - in this case collectively - by the undertakings currently in existence on the market is not in question because there is no other system for doing it .
- Mr President , thank you very much for your consideration ; great things are currently going on in my group , and so we had to be there .
That is not the way to solve the problem , particularly with regard to waste .
I read with concern reports about the misuse of tax revenue at provincial level .
I think that what is necessary here - and this is one of the lessons that , for example , the Bush administration in America has learned - is further legislation to ensure that consultants do not audit and that auditors cannot be consultants to the same company .
Is there actually anything to stop us introducing emissions trading in the European Union in the year 2005 , now that a number of countries have already made a start on emissions trading within their national borders ?
It is to the credit of the Court of Auditors , with its two special reports , and also to the credit of our colleague and rapporteur , who has submitted three reports on the subject , that light has now been shed on the dark recesses of the tourism sector .
The chosen form of a report makes for a discussion that is pertinent to the issue .
What we find regrettable is that the Commission has , in effect , been forced into this course of action after we made use of the legal instrument of Article 192 and opted to present a legislative own-initiative initiative report , despite the fact that the Commission has been aware of this problem for a very long time . Indeed , it has been mentioned repeatedly in a whole series of company law programmes ever since the days of Commissioner Bolkestein .
I should also like to note , however , that this is the first time the European Parliament is not saying a clear yes to a European treaty .
We cannot resolve it simply through Interpol and more stringent criminal law .
The chance to embark upon a genuinely new era in Europe must now be seized courageously and energetically .
It is not acceptable for the Commission to keep on defying a vote of this House by attempting to put the liberalisation and eventual privatisation of water , local public transport , health and education on the agenda .
The situation regarding inland ports is somewhat different .
But the governments of the European Union must also assume their share of the responsibility , and that means saying what they are doing and then doing what they are saying .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , once again , we are handling the subject of &apos; Protection of animals during transport &apos; .
No diversification has been adopted , as Parliament demanded , in order to safeguard the regions &apos; socio-ecological ecological development .
This joint debate accords with the strategies we formulated in Lisbon and Barcelona , and with our principle that business creates work and that everything that creates work is society &apos; s business .
We therefore make the following demands . First , the Member States must accept their responsibility and ratify the convention and the two protocols by next year ; secondly , if this ratification does not take place , the Commission should be called upon to propose more effective action .
Our objective remains what it always has been - the creation of a common judicial area , by which means alone we will succeed in winning the public over to enlargement and convincing them of its advantages .
Many of our proposed amendments refer to slot widths .
It is important to point this out in order to gain an understanding of the directive , be it in its first or second draft , and in order to classify it correctly in terms of its legal character .
Parliament still has to look at all the legal implications .
Once again there has been an environmental tragedy off the coast of Europe , namely the sinking of the Erika off Brittany .
Naturally that includes measures such as those you mentioned .
I can tell you that I fully support the principles , values and the direction to take that you set out in the letter .
What we have to do is to abandon any new EU constitution in favour of a foundational treaty on the cooperation , as equals , of states and peoples secure in their own identities , relying , I believe , on the principle of maximising strength in our dealings with the outside world and freedom at home , as well as laying down a demarcation of powers between the European Union and the Member States that is not susceptible to misinterpretation .
It is not the European Parliament or the Commission ; it is the governments of the sovereign Member States which have created a strong monetary area that is able to take external action , but which are not prepared to create the self-contained contained , internal instruments needed to establish a strong economic and social policy and a strong government policy alongside the strong currency .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when one is so far down the list of speakers , one always runs the risk of repeating certain points .
We will have a chance to put this into practice in tomorrow &apos; s vote .
Although I see that as an encouragement , this does not add up to extra money .
We have the impression that it comes rather too late .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Madam President , Mr Kallas , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their reports .
In this instance , therefore , all the institutions have a shared interest in finding a point from which they can all start .
Despite the discrepancies displayed in the EU targets , efforts and programmes in the lifelong learning sector still deserve our support .
It should be clear that what we are after is for the figure to be doubled .
Our heartfelt plea to the Commissioner , therefore , is that we have just one time slot , and therefore need a proposal quickly for strengthening cultural diversity in European internal market law .
That is why a broad majority of the committee - not a large majority ; the representatives of the minority view will be speaking shortly - said , as Parliament as a whole did in the first reading , without any dispute , that the &apos; no-special special-fee fee &apos; system was the best system because it , as it were , offers ships a financial incentive not to dump their muck into the water when they are at sea but to dispose of it in proper port reception facilities .
However , I hope we really succeed in nailing our colours to the mast this week , as in the case of the ban on tobacco advertising , and that we do not bow to the pressure of industry but are able to make it clear that everything possible must be done to protect children and young people , in particular , from taking up smoking .
It is good that the European Union has a strategy covering the period up to 2020 in order to resolve the many problems in current transport systems .
It is those who are sitting on this side of the House who will be the first to embrace you for saying that .
I could take the easy option and suggest that we vote &apos; no &apos; as we did last time .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur has mentioned that it was not exactly easy to draw up an opinion for Parliament .
So we will have to ensure that the new powers conferred on us by the Treaty of Amsterdam a few days ago are underpinned by our collective credibility .
That means I can only repeat what I just said .
The report therefore also demands that the action programme for better lawmaking should not be on the agenda for the Laeken Summit .
One is that this text allows the issuers , from a denomination per unit of EUR 1 000 and upwards , to choose , when it comes to the approval of the prospectus , between , firstly , the competent authority of the Member State in which the issuer &apos; s registered office is situated ; secondly , that of the Member State in which the securities are authorised to be traded on a regulated market ; or , thirdly , that of the Member State in which the securities are offered to the public .
Why would the North Sea be so dirty ?
I welcome the way the Hieronymi report sets all this out .
It goes without saying that these relations should be completely open and that controversial subjects should be addressed with certain goals in view .
Our goal is an active Europe , not a centralist Europe .
A minority in the Committee therefore proposed the adoption of new regulations on transparency in financial relations between ports and State offices and also on permissible State aid measures for ports , the intention being to provide legal protection for ports and also to prevent excessive aid provision .
There are no visions or specific statements of intent for the next 10 to 15 years .
Let me specifically confirm again , Mrs Theorin , that in the presidency &apos; s view the Non-Proliferation Proliferation Treaty is one of the most important international instruments of disarmament and international security .
I would like to emphasise what he said about being prepared to introduce reform and about the agreement in many areas .
As for transparency , we must ensure that the market is transparent for all as a place where prices emerge , and that everyone can understand how prices evolve there .
It also calls for a coordinated global approach for the digital environment , including an analysis of external factors such as privacy protection , citizens &apos; access to information technologies and Internet security .
In this sense , the report on the Agency for Reconstruction should make a contribution to sustainable crisis management .
Spain is only providing paper information about irregularities .
But we must not fool ourselves .
Mr President , thank you very much , Commissioner , thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
Where Turkey &quot; s membership is concerned , I ask you to consider the possibility of another form of relationship , for example by way of a privileged partnership .
Mrs Harms , the Polish Government was democratically elected and is highly respected within its own country .
We could only satisfy the desire , which was expressed by Mr Swoboda and is shared by many of you here , to increase pre-accession accession aid to Turkey , Malta and Cyprus in order to make the ISPA and SAPARD instruments accessible , by making available more budgetary resources , money which the Commission , at any rate , does not have . This must be discussed with the Council .
It is also regrettable that , consequently , it has not been possible to add to the progress made on the stability and convergence front , because the programmes have not been compared in terms of quality .
Over and above that , we must give industry a signal as to how things are to go in the future , and I see that - which is the approach we want to take - as a sensible thing to do .
Under these circumstances , there is no question but that the Austrians will reject this proposed regulation .
It can indeed be said that Turkey is in the midst of an intensive debate on the future course of its reform policy .
To be more precise , it is about the mutual recognition between the contracting parties of type-approvals approvals for automobiles which have been manufactured in accordance with these standards .
I cannot identify where we would have to amend European legislation in order to ensure that it was properly applied everywhere .
However , it has now achieved notoriety .
We have finished early nearly every Thursday afternoon over recent weeks .
With regard to quality standards , about which much has already been said , I am aware of the discussion in the press and also the talk about curved cucumbers .
His alleged confession to involvement in the bomb attacks was forced out of him , and his state of health is unknown after several reports of torture .
This is not the fault of the European Parliament .
By virtue of this hierarchy of remedy options , Parliament has struck a reasonable balance between the interests of consumers and sellers .
Of course , we need an External Action Service , not only for the reasons mentioned by the President of the Commission and to provide effective regulations concerning unity and a common foreign policy , but also for reasons of parliamentary control .
I think that greater involvement of the social partners in a tripartite social summit and a strengthened macroeconomic dialogue are noteworthy ideas .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , health is a precious thing that it is important to preserve .
That is the only correct approach .
Mr President , I should also like to offer sincere thanks to Claude Desama .
The fact that a small number of countries have allowed the hormone to be used must not lead to a watering down of international health standards .
That is a fact ; indeed , it has been .
The Committee also feared - and this was borne out to some extent by the documents - that the Commission had not always drawn the correct conclusions from the documents of the Vienna study and , furthermore , was consciously conducting a policy that we doubted was the right course in the case of some particular issues .
Mr President , Mr President-in in-Office Office , the message I am getting from the governments is that this is an Irish problem .
I take it that he is aware that this House is also grateful for the part he played and for the way in which he involved the European Parliament delegation .
As I said , there was only a short , informal debate on the subject and the next step envisaged is the initial consideration of overland transport under the Austrian Presidency in the Council of Transport Ministers on 1 October , although again merely as a policy debate , since presumably the question of charges will not be debated formally before the German elections .
In any event , it would be unjustifiable to leave it lying around unused any longer than is absolutely necessary .
It offers the prospect of sustainable , harmonious and at the same time policentric development for the EU as a whole .
The Commission agrees in principle with the Committee on Budgets here .
That is true of our group .
Here , practicability must be the key imperative .
It is a matter of genuinely joining forces to achieve better control and harmonisation , and I expect the Commission to submit a report within the coming year on the possible harmonisation measures , including those under the new rule in the Treaty of Lisbon .
Russia can only be a partner if it ceases this genocide immediately .
At the same time , though , the creation of new agencies is repeatedly endorsed , not only by this House , but also , and predominantly , by the Council .
The management team or , in smaller businesses , the manager , must be quick to recognise market openings for their products and services and must adjust their range rapidly to keep up with customer demand .
In Article 10 of the Takeovers Directive , we laid down comprehensive rules on transparency according to which all enterprises have to set out openly all the existing obstacles to a takeover .
That is precisely the point from which our proposals proceeded .
Milosevic is audacious , but the West is too timid , and incapable of putting an end to his activities .
Sometimes we get tired of playing this game .
The only German political foundation that had been allowed to function in Minsk has had to close .
Of course , it is important that the 65 % that is de-coupled coupled continues to be paid to producers , whether they are growing or not .
Surely , as the European Parliament , we too must be able once in a while to acknowledge positive results - so that when the people outside hear us , they will see that progress is being made - instead of always using the same negative yardstick . What use is that to anyone ?
It cannot be in anyone &apos; s interest that the civil war should become more widespread or go on for any longer .
We also need to take the Lisbon strategy seriously , and then even more seriously ; that much is evident to me from seeing what is going on in some countries as regards investments in education , training , research and development , as well as infrastructure .
Social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis .
The events of 11 September and the period that followed caused enormous problems not only for all European airlines but also for airlines in the US .
But as this point was accepted nonetheless , we voted in favour of the report on account of its fundamentally positive thrust .
In many cases full membership will not be an option .
On 10 October Hu Jia took part in a press conference on human rights , which was held at the European Parliament in Brussels .
The litmus test for the genetic engineering industry is not authorisation but sales .
A glance at history shows us that every currency union lacking the backup of political union failed .
I recommend that we make our decision in November .
Without them , I believe that we would be doing Europe no favours as a location for industry .
- I have just voted against the composition of this Commission and abstained from voting for Romano Prodi .
A number of Member States have not yet considered the fact that positions which , in their own national interest , they have so far unanimously supported will have dramatically different implications in an enlarged Community - not least from the point of view of national interest .
The Read report makes the accessibility of the basic services at acceptable prices and standards of quality a prerequisite of our support for the present liberalisation process .
Because the Americans are going to have problems implementing the liquidity standard , they are now attempting , once again , to introduce additional criteria alongside the external ratings .
Overall , 1 500 universities and over 10 000 schools throughout the European Union have participated in this programme over the last four years .
In terms of monetary policy , we are talking balanced budgets , low inflation and the development of a culture of stability .
We must not lose sight of that in this debate .
We know what the problems are .
Mr Le Rachinel was , as it were , in the fortunate position after careful checking to be able to say : I need only one amendment .
Then we will not have a chance to gain the support of any panel in this area .
Secondly , international fisheries agreements benefit the exploitation of waters outside Europe and give support both to European fishermen and to the development of third countries .
Mr CaÃ±ete &apos; s report , which in itself was a very good piece of work , is the 1996 annual review of the Commission &apos; s report for this period .
They account for 99 % of all European businesses .
This law does not curtail freedom of research either .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur .
Let me conclude by saying that it is easy for us to explain to any critically-minded minded consumer that healthy meat on healthy bone is part of good diet .
Time and again , United Nations observers and inspectors are more or less expelled or forced to leave the country .
We considered whether we should conduct a joint mission with the United Nations and with James Baker .
Allow me to make another comment based on the philosophy of law : a community of nations under the rule of law is based on trust .
In 2008 , the at-risk risk-of of-poverty poverty rate for people aged 65 years and over stood at 19 % .
This was a matter of urgency , because interoperability is a fundamental prerequisite for liberalising international freight traffic , and this is something that we have together got on track , as it were , through the railways package .
Madam President-in in-Office Office , I have two quite specific questions .
We believe that this directive does a good job of striking a balance between the freedom of movement and quality protection , and I hope that the planned services directive will do nothing to interfere with this .
The report itself was worthy of discussion , but was not controversial .
This is a bold and ambitious plan , and it is one that needs to be discussed .
It is unfortunate that backlogs persist ; Sapard &quot; s implementation rate , for example , was higher than in the previous year , but 2 % is still a disgracefully low figure .
We therefore expect them to receive the financial appropriations that they need .
All passengers now have basic rights in very important areas : liability , rights of persons with reduced mobility , information , and then , stage by stage and at times unfortunately with very long transitional periods , further-reaching reaching rights for all .
That cannot go on indefinitely .
We will , of course , be consistent in moving this issue forward .
Through your exemplary work , you have managed to align the position of the European Parliament with that of lawyers in many areas .
Some of our countries are very open , because they can afford to be , while some , however , are in difficulties because they got around only very late to introducing reforms and transforming themselves .
The objective must be to make clear that environmentally friendly services and maintenance of the countryside do not &apos; cost nothing &apos; , but maintain an accountable market value .
The measures which seem technically feasible in the case of cars may not necessarily be achievable for light commercial vehicles .
If it were to occur at all , it would be in the justification , but that is not what we are dealing with .
Opportunities abound .
I personally am positive that the national authorities are closer to the market than the Commission and are therefore better placed to decide how and to what extent the telecommunications markets can be further liberalised on a case-by by-case case basis .
In other words , freight traffic , especially transit freight traffic , is growing massively .
I hope that this contradiction can be overcome .
Many unemployed people in the world and in Europe do not receive the support that speculators enjoy worldwide when they speculate against weaker currencies .
We should concentrate on this , and then we can avoid disgraces such as we have seen today .
I should like to focus on just two points .
Individual States and the European Community are defrauded of tax revenues and excise duties , but honest dealers also suffer - the ones who pay their taxes as a matter of course and who end up having to pay higher taxes because the fraudsters have spared themselves that expense .
Mr President , Madam President-in in-Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me say just a few words about the key points of the 2007 Budget , which will be the first under the new Financial Perspective .
However , we need an EU-wide wide solution - not 27 different EU solutions - and we need an international solution too .
We also want more information on the agencies &apos; revenue - which , thinking of Alicante , can indeed be sizeable - and we want to know what is happening to this revenue .
Studies show that even in these part-time time jobs , women are still paid significantly less than men for the same working hours and the same work .
These two possibilities are alternatives to paying the money to the Hamas-run run Palestinian Authority , which has responded to the suicide bombing by making appalling statements , while the Israeli Prime Minister Mr Olmert has been measured in his words .
I know how difficult it was to extract the compromise from the Council which exempts children under the age of 12 from the obligation to provide fingerprints .
Mr President , I have two brief comments to make to the previous speaker , my esteemed colleague Mr Oostlander .
On 22 September , the Committee on Industry and Energy unanimously adopted a recommendation on this .
We Europeans believe in the peace process that Mr Rabin initiated , and we shall do everything in our power to ensure the success of that process .
We have also taken the trouble to speak with academics from France , Germany and Great Britain because we believe that the academic sector should have an input here as well .
Our Parliament has the traditional policy of defending existing programmes .
The potential applications of GMES are also most important to the European Security and Defence Policy .
Until such time as we resolve this contradiction , we can hold as many debates in this House as we like , but we will not achieve a greater degree of efficiency .
This is to do with the original text &apos; s stipulation that the Joint Undertaking &apos; s registered office should be located somewhere where it would be exempted from taxation .
Therefore we need this financial transaction tax .
Naturally , certain conditions are laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement , but it does not specify that the flexibility reserve has to be the first port of call .
What does illegal mean in the EU ?
The third point is the accent on language learning , and here I want to contradict all those who have said that this is not important .
One example of this is that Commissioner Vitorino &apos; s proposals on family reunification may suit some people , but it is not possible to stipulate a binding solution for the entire Union .
Labour law also lacks rules outlawing discrimination , with the consequence that legal action cannot be taken in respect of such things as the violation of the right to respect for human dignity .
If we examine the process regarding the cage-rearing rearing of hens , for example , we - Parliament and the European Union - have already made significant progress .
UNICEF and other agencies then organised a meeting of experts on children &apos; s rights on 14 March 2003 .
It is grotesque that in recent days , Congress has debated a bill which vehemently opposes the establishment of the International Criminal Court - a Court which would deal with crimes like these , especially if they were supported and perpetrated by states .
Finally , Mr Prodi , in tomorrow &apos; s vote we shall be endorsing both yourself as an individual and your political work to date .
Of this , around 20 % has already been allocated to specific projects .
It is important for us to make these points clearly , as only then will we be able to have an open and frank debate .
Unfortunately , this report has been ill-fated fated from the outset .
Finally , the Council wishes to stress that the Commission , in accordance with the Hague Programme , which the European Council adopted on 4 November 2004 , will , before the end of this year , be submitting an evaluation report on the agency .
That would have been honest , and big firms like NestlÃ© , Unilever , and others would have gone along with it .
It is right for the report to talk about &apos; everything but arms &apos; .
I would have liked to simply approve the common position without further ado .
I am not sure whether what has been stated in this regard is ambitious or whether it is excessive .
Let us call it a Council of European Ministers , meeting weekly , or more often if necessary , in Brussels or , of course , in the national capitals , and always available within their governments .
Any such administration must be in a position to adopt the acquis quickly , to develop a stakeholder society and to provide proof of efficient auditing of accounts .
I therefore request that we keep to this order .
I think I can present you with a budget which has earned Parliament &apos; s confidence .
We should not forget that the gross national product of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is only five per cent of that of the present European Union .
What is the point of a highly ambitious Lisbon objective if we do not have plenty of specific measures ?
Such a Europe must become more competitive , and so working in it must again be made worth the effort .
The European Company is supposed to attract companies to Europe .
The start of negotiations between Belgrade and representatives of the Kosovo Albanians should be made conditional upon a moratorium on the fighting .
Our vote of confidence is no blank cheque but an offer of constructive co-operation operation from many Members of this Chamber .
Secondly , I take the view that Mrs Bonino &apos; s reflections are something we should all share .
I should be interested to hear what the President-in in-Office Office intends to do about these measures , which have been taken in the United States under the guise of combating terrorism ?
I wanted to make that absolutely clear .
What might the side-effects effects of the regulation be ?
I would also advise the House not to misconstrue the instrument of the convention as a deus ex machina of the European Union .
Transit transport within the Community can really only be resolved by certain new provisions in the road cost directive , the Euro-Vignette Vignette .
It enjoys support right across the groups , and the reason why that is so is that all concerned have met others halfway and arrived at compromises for the sake of the matter in hand .
The shipyards simply have to maintain or achieve productivity and competitiveness through their own efforts .
I would like to start by thanking the Commission for committing itself to plugging the gaps between the trans-European European transport network in the European Union and the TINA network in the candidate countries .
What do they propose to do with the waste that has been produced in Europe for decades ?
Restricting the scope of licences to single Member States would be an excessively narrow approach .
By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany , we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation , which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise !
What is the use of laws and agreements if they are not socially effective ?
... to both these Member States . I find it an unacceptable system in which those who are at the end of the day to be criticised , themselves decide whether such criticism should be meted out !
In addition , with regard to Amendment 3 that has been adopted , I am not of the opinion that the current ban on meat and bone meal for non-ruminants ruminants should be reviewed .
But they do have a clear strategic notion of what is important and they have effective machinery .
That applies to both Montenegro and Kosovo .
After all , we agree on the aim of promoting combined transport , because we want to see the transport of goods shifted from the roads to the railways and waterways .
Turkey &apos; s Prime Minister , Mr ErdoÄan , would therefore be well advised - despite having many elections to fight - to press on with the gender justice policy and encourage women to work independently .
When we started discussing this in 1999 - the business between Austria and Germany is sufficiently well known - I had just been elected to Parliament , and today , three hours before my birthday , we are going a bit further .
Reducing aid through modulation leads to an unreasonable drop in agricultural income .
Secondly , we need to push forward the use of liquefied natural gas .
A number of amendments have to do with national discretion , which is to be removed for the sake of greater regulatory harmonisation in the internal market .
We are aware of the constitutional difficulties that exist at present , but , having satisfied ourselves that the government is working on it , we have hope of it being ratified soon .
We are also considering laying down mandatory targets for motor-vehicle vehicle fuel efficiency , for example , but other aspects , too , have to be taken into account , such as policy measures to promote the use of low-carbon carbon fuels , and changing driving habits .
Hundreds of injured detainees had to receive hospital treatment .
In order to meet their obligations to the population , the EU Member States consequently spent billions to combat an influenza outbreak whose potential threat is much less than that of normal influenza .
It is the Council which forms a barrier within the Union .
We wanted to see if the &apos; averaging and banking &apos; model was perhaps after all unjustifiable in European terms , being something of a bureaucratic monster that would be hard to keep a check on in Europe and which , to that extent , would tell us little about whether we could achieve the reductions we were aiming for .
We have to match up to that responsibility by adopting the appropriate directives and providing the necessary support .
The Commission therefore suggested revising the figures by EUR 300 million .
The ambitious goal which has been set , Mr President , namely to organize a summit with tangible results , has every chance of success , not least because of the enormous personal commitment and inspiration involved .
If no , why is it no longer concerned ?
There is no rule , however , for the President , although his conduct should , of course , be exemplary .
Two absolutely crucial core labour standards - No 87 and No 98 , relating to collective bargaining - have not be implemented or ratified .
We must do that , but the first need is to create jobs , we must create infrastructure , so that the young people who are now going around with Kalashnikovs , can finally hold tools in their hands and do something for their country .
The European Union goes the furthest towards solving all those problems for which national borders present no obstacle .
This is the only way to make this proposal practicable and to ensure that proper information is forthcoming .
By all means , let us have the principle of subsidiarity , but , in that case , the Member States also need to act .
I wish to support the compromise amendments which the rapporteur has tabled in this report concerning user charges for heavy goods vehicles .
Mr President , Mrs Gradin , ladies and gentlemen .
Tell your colleagues in the Council that it is not a matter of incorporating these countries overnight for want of any other option but rather of maintaining the vision and the possibility of accession so that young people see the logic of remaining in the region instead of depopulating it by emigrating .
Everyone talks about demographic development .
I think I understood you correctly , Commissioner , but I would like to ask whether the issue of the Office for Minority Languages which was initiated by the European Parliament in 1982 is thus secure or whether you take the view that such a long-term term project still has no legal basis , and how , in your opinion , this legal basis can be created .
Our first task is therefore to come up with a standard set of rules , before we can even think of authorizing anything .
Finally , I would like to summarise the situation as follows . The Commission welcomes the fact that it has Parliament &apos; s agreement to support Bulgaria over the next four years with the sum of EUR 300 million .
The European Union is called upon to combat terrorism in any form together with the international community .
This is not the sudden escalation of a conflict . Kosovo has been the scene of systematic discrimination , torture , expulsion and even genocide for years .
What we could do - but are not doing - is to hold these three countries as hostages to fortune , so as to put the Commission and Council under pressure .
What the citizens of Europe are expecting is for work finally to begin again after the long months of crisis and paralysis , but under better conditions which increase people &apos; s confidence in the Commission .
This raises the initial question of whether we really have to have competition between ourselves in Europe when it comes to public money .
There is a lot of money at stake here , but more particularly , it is also about people &apos; s health .
We should make it unmistakably clear to the Cuban Government and the Cuban people that we are prepared to develop our economic , social and cultural relations with Cuba , and that to this end we need to establish contacts with open-minded minded , creative and democratic Cubans and their organisations , whether within the ACP framework or on the basis of a bilateral agreement .
Finally , thanks to a system of widely varying controls and sanctions , what we have done , instead of making sure there was a level playing field is to create a climate of mistrust , so that today every fisherman thinks he is worse off than fishermen in neighbouring countries .
Mr President , nobody wants road hogs to endanger life .
We want to satisfy that wish and we worked together really well with the German Presidency .
This agreement can also be adopted or rejected regardless of them , but it cannot yet enter into force , as the security rules have not yet been adopted .
I have been involved with this since the climate conference in Rio in 1992 .
Thirdly , products exported from China are often in breach of patents and copyright .
They can , for example , reserve certain fishing grounds for small vessels or they can gear their programmes to the coastal fleet in order to preserve jobs in the coastal regions in particular .
There are not enough facilities for the care of children and other dependents and in general there is a lack of flexibility .
- Mr President , I am in favour of this being treated as an urgent matter .
We offer her our utmost support in this .
In the case of renewable sources of energy or the CO2 policy , nothing will be achieved in the long run without sanctions .
Yet I want to state clearly on behalf of my group : we still believe that on principle such actions must be carried out by the United Nations and we must do all we can to reform the United Nations in such a way as to make that possible in future .
The increasing scarcity of food is causing price rises and hitting our consumers hard , but they are hitting consumers in Latin America even harder .
On this basis , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we should be able to reinforce the European perspective for use as an instrument in the area between membership and the neighbourhood policy and thereby widen the area of stability , peace and freedom in Europe without endangering the development potential of the European Union .
May I remind you that at the November 2000 summit in Zagreb the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States and the countries of the Western Balkans expressed their commitment to the stabilisation and association process .
We must convey to the world &quot; s Muslim communities that we wish to continue to work alongside them in developing a relationship built on trust .
To all intents and purposes , it can also have an impact on the situation in Africa &apos; s neighbouring countries .
The same year saw the expiry of the Robert Schuman Project , which had been limited to three years and served to make lawyers more aware of Community law .
Energy taxation is a completely separate sector .
This is a precondition , for the taxpayer - to whom both of you have rightly referred - cannot be expected to rebuild infrastructure only to see it destroyed .
Let me conclude by saying that , no matter who it is that turns up and presents himself , we will judge him by his policy statements , and not by his political past .
As regards the increases in thresholds proposed in the report , past experience shows that the lower the thresholds are set , the more firms participate in public calls for tender .
I can therefore give my full support to Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 4 which have been tabled here .
The national States have to decide to take a step backwards .
Besides , an even more pressing task is to probe who actually benefits from growth and what form that growth should take .
The German Bundesbank - which to German conservatives is as the Vatican is to Catholics - writes in its monthly report for March : &apos; However , financial contributions from the International Monetary Fund to resolve structural problems - such as to directly finance a budget deficit or to finance a bank recapitalisation - are incompatible with its monetary mandate &apos; .
Most important of all , we need a system of tried and tested practice .
I myself became a Member of this House at a time when my country was still divided .
We have one at the moment , for the euro .
We also appeal to the European shipping companies to come to us and to the Commission if there are problems , so that we can follow them up .
This is all about adding bioethanol to petrol .
Our present predicament demands that we should work together in the interests of consumers , fishermen and fish stocks .
Once again , sincere thanks to Mrs Gebhardt .
However , it seems to me that in this motion for a resolution , individuals who stand up for their own culture and national identity are all too quickly and easily suspected of racism .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe alcohol was dangerous in the past and alcohol is dangerous today .
It will be apparent to the House that we take this resolution very seriously , and we urge the Commission , for the public &quot; s sake , to do likewise .
In my view that would be a pity !
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is quite clear - and it has already been stated , Mr Langen - that Greece must do its own homework .
But we also know very well that participation in decision making , be it by men or women , is not an automatic right .
It is a good thing , too , that they are evidently meeting with determined resistance from a substantial section of Europe &quot; s Christian Social movement , and we are glad to see it .
Why is it that Mrs Garaud has been unable to undertake the mission ?
It is a difficult time because we are now having to face up to the new possibilities for reform of the EU and because of the result of the Irish referendum .
The other is that the report clearly calls for action to be taken now on the portability of occupational pensions , which means considering a new directive .
The Commission proposes that the resources needed for this should be made available from the flexibility instrument .
At one moment we are in favour of taxation on the basis of fuel consumption , the next we are against it .
In the case of Djibouti , it is the right to freedom of opinion and freedom of political activity .
There are different risk categories .
Mr President-in in-Office Office , we are pleased to point out that you made it a general rule , virtually anticipating the rules of the Amsterdam Treaty , to listen to Parliament on action in the area of the third pillar .
Things have not yet got quite that bad with the WTO , but what happened in CancÃºn is certainly a cause for concern .
We have to take action now and make use of all the technical possibilities offered by present-day day coaches .
This kind of action plan to promote renewable energy sources must contain the following basic features : forward-looking looking , clear and credible declarations of intent must be made at the highest political level , which the European and national legislators must incorporate into a binding legislative framework .
That means we need a European Union representative at the UN offices , not a Commission office , a Council office and an office for the Presidency . No , we need a representative for foreign affairs , and that is what Parliament is proposing .
Mr President , the report works on the basic assumption that the easily-accessible accessible fresh water reserves have been largely opened up , that long-term term water use and savings can be achieved by using economic leverage , and that this would promote the responsible use of water .
If that sounds like Marxism to Mr Verhofstadt , to us it is a question of social security and social policy .
We have opted for training , and accordingly we intend to enable those Member States which prefer to set a younger minimum age to guarantee legal certainty in this respect for their citizens , but their systems would have to be graduated as prescribed in the draft directive .
That shows that we are meeting your people and their interests halfway !
This must also be linked with the possibility of impounding ships in ports throughout the EU if there are grounds to suspect breaches of the law .
The natural right of any government to defend itself against terrorism is often only used as a pretext .
According to WHO forecasts , in the district of Gomel in Belarus alone , which is the main area affected , a third of the children who were under four years of age when the accident occurred will contract cancer of the thyroid during their lifetime .
According to the latest reports from the UN , Kosovo is today a completely devastated country in which neither people &apos; s security is guaranteed nor the population &apos; s nutritional needs provided for .
I think it is regrettable that we have not committed to a 120 g / km ceiling from 2012 .
Since this could pose problems for some banks or insurance companies , we advocate that this capital increase take the form of government holdings entailing corresponding influence on company policy .
Following what I hope is the merely temporary collapse of the new constitution , let us , today , send out a very quiet message to the effect that there is perhaps such a thing as progress in Europe after all .
It cannot just be left to the money technocrats !
You say that you want more transparency and consultation , but whom are you excluding and whom are you including ?
I would also call for it to be at last stipulated that all feedingstuffs should be labelled .
Have we really taken note of the fact that Europe &apos; s influence in climate policy has diminished ?
If Parliament &apos; s proposal is adopted , the 2003 Budget will represent 1.05 % of the combined economic output of all the Member States , that is to say the same level as this year .
And one last point - I am naturally in favour of allowing our citizens to bring legal actions .
Is there a right to natural children or a right to healthy natural children or , ultimately , a right to eternal life , healthy of course ?
I would just like to point out that the deletion of the definition of special services , including express services , was Parliament &apos; s idea and was taken over by the Council , and that the retention of price and weight limits for outgoing mail in the Council text was something Parliament had demanded , and thus a great success for us .
These documents will show you what stage the various projects had reached and the reasons why the Commission thinks they should be withdrawn .
We want to make a point of stressing and applauding that .
Mr President , I would like to talk about Mrs Paliadeli &apos; s report , specifically because I believe that the European Ombudsman must actually represent the citizens of the European Union .
in writing . - I am voting against the report because it has not been drawn up according to strictly scientific criteria and because I regard the zone model - in whatever version - as meaningless .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , on behalf of my group , I want to thank you for the work you , together with your whole Commission , have done for the European Union over the past five years .
First it opined that the sanction mechanism was too heavy .
A third central requirement to be met by the future legal order for the information society is that it should take greater account of the convergence of the information and communications technology media , which will result in the future mediamatic society , to guarantee an integrated policy for all media and services , and - this is particularly to be regarded as an appeal to the Member States - the further discussion of a centralized European telecommunications authority .
Secondly : as far as financial assistance is concerned , a distinction should be made between everyone and those who need this financial assistance .
But you would not want to use it to apply for another job , because you would not get it .
Mr President , I would like to take this opportunity to make a couple of fundamental points about the Commission &apos; s proposal for a directive .
In this way , although the ships will have to pay , they will also be protected .
It may be pointed out in this context that the Community rules on data protection , which also apply in the European Economic Area , give Member States the opportunity to take legislative action .
This , indeed , is an absolute must in a time where we are actually fighting for a transparent , democratic Europe .
Madam President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur , and I think that this report really enables us to make progress on an issue of great significance politically , economically , and in terms of environmental and energy policy .
We only advanced bit by bit .
I would like to comment on two additional points .
I am eager to see what the Commission will do with the slogan &apos; Dynamic action , balance between stability and efficiency &quot; .
According to Commissioner Schreyer today , that will not be very easy to achieve .
Measures against illegal immigrants and against organised crime also have my support .
I shall be brief .
I very much regret this because avoiding a conciliation procedure would have speeded up the entry into force of the regulations .
The same applies to inland ports with a volume of 500 000 tonnes of freight , which I think is a proper order of magnitude .
Could you consider encouraging the preparation of a Green Paper on the safety of reactors or nuclear installations , so that in future a relatively objective assessment of the subject may be guaranteed ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in regard to animal protection may I point out firstly - and precisely in order to counter the argument about international distortions of competition - that this should play a part during the next WTO round and should be considered during the next agricultural negotiations .
It is important to me that these people receive these funds quickly and without significant bureaucratic frictional losses .
I also support the enabling clause in connection with the convention , because we do not want to tie our hands in the event of a different political outcome occurring .
Let me take this further by quoting Brecht .
That , too , had to be taken into account in a very thorny and politically unstable situation , in which there will , of course , have to be further developments .
I share the view that people have a right to know who votes and which way when it comes to laws and regulations that affect their daily lives .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy indeed to support the report presented by Mrs Jackson , because I believe this represents a great step forward in environmental matters for the whole of Europe .
The EU wants to use Frontex to ward off people coming in from outside ; it does not want to save lives .
Overall , therefore , I think the report is a constructive one : it provides a good starting-point point for further discussion in the various European forums .
It can only be done on the basis of the factual content of a proposal , and when it comes to amendments , on the basis of the factual content of these amendments .
Mr President , I am following in the tradition of Winston Churchill , who said : &apos; We must build a kind of United States of Europe &apos; .
We have heard that various groups have adopted diverse positions .
An increasing number of jobs in rural areas will be at risk as a result of these difficulties , unless , in the interests of those concerned , an unvarnished and - if necessary - blunt analysis of the shortcomings is finally carried out .
I do not have the time to go into every individual point so I will only comment on a few that I regard as most important .
In summary , as regards the Toys Directive , we have produced a document which , to the best of our knowledge and belief , corresponds to what was possible at the time it was adopted .
To put it simply : SIS II is a de facto failure and to keep on crawling round it - to put it one way - is meaningless .
Of course , money is also needed to combat world hunger . However , it is not just about money .
Will meat become cheaper , given the planned 30 % price reduction ?
That does not mean , though , that we will not continue to work with Ukraine with great verve and enthusiasm , as the President-in in-Office Office said .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to offer my very sincere thanks to you for coming here today .
Even in the regions of the ACP countries , the effects of climate change could turn out to be disastrous .
Along with the numerous previous contributors to this debate , may I say thank you very much to Mrs Paulsen for the work she has done , but I also hope that we can reach a practicable solution and that we can send out long-term term signals from which the feed industry , waste processors and farmers can take their lead .
In no way can this do anything to resolve the structural problems of society and the economy .
These 27 Member States have two million soldiers , 10 000 tanks and 3 000 fighter aircraft .
We have no way of bringing such a situation about , and it is for this reason that I believe , in the final analysis , that the proposal before us , which I recommend you to adopt , is clearly the best achievable .
The question therefore arises as to whether assistance should not be provided from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund , particularly to workers in Madeira , because many work places will , of course , have been destroyed , and whether we could not support the small and medium-sized sized enterprises in the reconstruction work .
Restricting the permissible working hours of self-employed employed professional drivers in this way - and perhaps , in future , also those of self-employed employed tradesmen , architects or Members of Parliament - would send out the wrong signal .
Now is the time for truth !
Transgenic maize is a time bomb as far as consumers and environmental protection are concerned .
For example , the report does not differentiate between the various weight classes of vehicles and therefore makes unrealistic demands of car manufacturers .
It makes sense to include inflation targeting as a strategy at the point of transition because we have to take account of uncertainties , particularly the unpredictable portfolio decisions of financial market operators .
The Commission would therefore welcome it if these could be further clarified .
I therefore particularly welcome the Commission plan to speed up the association agreement and I think that the revision of the MEDA regulation was a very good move .
We must be clear that sales-based based support for live animal exports is an incentive and that we are therefore deceiving ourselves if we want to cut animal transports to a minimum so long as such support continues .
Madam President , can it be that those who in recent days have been calling persistently for roll-call call votes have not been doing so this afternoon because most of them are absent ?
Subsidiarity is one of the basic principles of EU law and is based on the condition that the subordinate member is able to resolve problems and carry out tasks independently . The areas of justice and home affairs have traditionally been the responsibility of the Member States .
That would be a particularly significant move , since the University of Pristina across the border in Kosovo is currently subject to brutal repression .
Of course , we live in the real world , however , and following a 5 % fall in vehicle production over the last year , the industry is expecting a further 15 % fall in 2009 .
( Loss of sound )
This would be easy to keep track of , and also feasible using present-day day methods .
For that , Mr Diamandouros , I should like to thank you most warmly .
Mr President , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , the crisis in European farming is already bad enough , thanks to BSE .
At the same time , it was unsatisfactory that no actual measurements were taken using balloons , for example , but that everyone was working with statistical extrapolations . Many of the citizens of Europe were annoyed about this .
The particularly favourable position of Israel as regards educational software , which I have referred to , represents an ideal field of cooperation for the European Union .
Mr Makhkamboy Azimovich Makhmudov , who is leading the delegation , is accompanied by Mr Nosir Yusupovich Salimov and Mr Gulkhoja Gangibekov .
While there are still people in the world who need goods and services , there will still be opportunities for growth .
The discussion on the common organisation of the markets does not end there .
However , I am also disappointed with the proposal put forward by the Commission on changing the own resource system .
Progress has been made , and for that I want to express my gratitude , but these things are extraordinarily complex , and I would like again to encourage you to help , perhaps by developing some sort of multifunctional location device .
However , Colonel Gaddafi &apos; s call for the European Union to pay Africa at least EUR 5 billion a year to combat illegal immigration is definitely a move in the wrong direction .
Nowhere in the world are there such strict standards and requirements as in the USA and Europe .
In fact , the statements from the Wise Men make it clear that we in Europe need a new culture of responsibility and I would like to add , Mr Kinnock , that on this very point it would be an enticing prospect to continue the hearings from the past week because many issues from the hearings which are still unclear have to be tidied up in terms of definitions and clarity since we would certainly like to know how exactly the Commission should look and function in future .
False expectations are being awakened , and you have a responsibility to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact .
Such a thing is an absurdity , and one we are not prepared to go along with .
We focused on medical research , as we believed that it was in this area that there was the greatest need for change to the Commission &apos; s proposal .
I believe that we should rely primarily on the Treaty and that it , as in the past , should be the basis for any decision .
At the same time , I think we have to take another look at Annex I , section 7 , which is simply a list of technical numerical values .
This economic system has taken us into the deepest financial , economic and employment crisis and the deepest crisis in the morality and legitimacy of the institutions since the end of the Second World War .
Mr Cohn-Bendit Bendit himself drew a subtle distinction between those who are self-evidently evidently European and a shift towards Eurasia .
We have the opportunity to turn the maritime economy into the largest area of growth in our economy as a whole .
I assume that you will follow up the question asked by Mr Ferber .
The purpose of the present regulation is to improve and accelerate within the internal market the free movement of judgements in matrimonial cases and in parental responsibility proceedings .
According to Article 1 of the Treaty on European Union , they were supposed to be creating an ever closer political union .
Or is it not rather to be feared that your actions have begotten new hatred a thousand times over , a hatred that will explode at the next opportunity , be it in the Middle East or perhaps even here in Europe ?
It is absolutely unacceptable for the USA to threaten unilateral measures again European firms that really have nothing at all to do with the banana market organisation , with the dispute about it .
I would therefore suggest , even if it is not strictly in accordance with the procedure , that we ask Mr Herman again to say quite clearly what the subject of the oral amendment is , as tabled by Mr Friedrich .
We must give the industry a second chance and the industry must grasp this second chance .
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening , that reflects a rapid decline in quality , while at the same time prices are sometimes rising , which is something else we must note .
I think we do not need to use the Budget procedure to reinvent agricultural policy , but I do of course expect the Commission to submit its proposals on the Mid-Term Term Review in good time , so that we are in a position to incorporate whatever is of budgetary value into the framework of the 2003 Budget procedure .
With respect to gas , it must be said , to be fair to our Russian friends , that their intention was to get Ukraine to pay the world market price , although the world market price is a relative term , so it would be better to say the standard price in Europe , of about USD 220 per thousand cubic metres .
Criticism of religious intolerance therefore cannot be directed towards a religion as a whole , but must be directed towards those who practise or interpret their own religions in a truly inhuman way , generally out of a desire to achieve or remain in power .
Company relocations to the east , where workers earn a tenth of our wages , and the pressure from the latter to move to the high-wage wage countries , mean that many of our citizens see enlargement to the east as a nightmare .
I am certainly in favour of this one House , by way of a Members &apos; Statute , adhering to the principle of &apos; equal pay for equal work &apos; .
One final point : if we intend to pursue a genuine structural and regional policy , a far closer link must be forged between the company &quot; s need for support and the beneficial regional impact of such support .
How different this was to the situation only a few months ago , a situation that had prevailed over a number of years , when the observations we made in the pursuit of our efforts to clarify the Echelon question fell on many a deaf ear .
You said that we need courage , and I thought that your speech was very courageous .
Greece must be able to make the grade in this respect too .
This was my fourth intergovernmental conference .
I would like to congratulate Germany on a broadly successful Presidency though I would venture to suggest that it might have been perceived as more successful had it been trumpeted rather less .
More efficient linkage of existing authorities would be a different matter .
( Applause ) We must work at building something more than just a monetary union , for if we do not at the same time create a social union , a democratic union , then our citizens will look on monetary union as an edifice which they must fear .
Thirdly , what actions does the Commission contemplate taking in order to do away with this discrimination against one single professional group ?
That applies to all the republics of the former Yugoslavia .
That is to say , EUR 7 billion which has to come from the Member States and from the European Union .
I can only make brief mention here of key words such as competition , security of production , quality of production , and others .
It is stated in the common position that the Member States can stipulate that the public be allowed to give their opinion on specific issues .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to make two comments on the Inglewood report .
Although this is a very thorough and open-minded minded report , my group has some difficulties with it , and that is not because it is so openly critical of the Canadians at various points .
I ask myself why we have to wait until things have gone wrong before making use of the appropriate legislative measures , which are already in place , to protect the people and the economies of Europe .
The coalition has undertaken to table this before the Nationalrat ( National Assembly ) by January 2001 , and the highly criticised government is continuing to burnish Austria &apos; s already excellent image in the field of human rights .
To be precise , I expect that Zimbabwe &apos; s Foreign Minister will not be invited to the EU-SADEC SADEC meeting of Foreign Ministers in Copenhagen in November , and we should make it clear to our partners in southern Africa that European money is not intended to finance an African renaissance or a new NEPAD programme of African development for President Mugabe and his political allies .
That is why we have introduced an amendment providing for a 5-year year guarantee , so as to finally achieve this breakthrough to sustainability .
But then , according to Rule 102 ( 1 ) , that would not be possible , because they are not available in all the languages .
Finance must play a constructive role , and not a destructive one , in our economies .
Whatever criticisms one might - and must - make of Turkey &quot; s domestic situation , it is a self-evident evident fact that , over the past three years , the prospect of accession has made possible more reforms in that country than the forty years of discussions that preceded it .
Similarly , in the Savary report what is the problem with including chemical pollution in a civil liability regime alongside oil pollution ?
Budgeting is not about demanding more ; it is about making proper use of the taxpayers &apos; available resources .
At the last moment , the rapporteur - who tabled an amendment contrary to the agreement we had reached - wanted to reinsert a provision to the effect that discrimination against men and women in the context of reconciling family and career duties counts as discrimination for the purposes of the directive .
I would have liked Parliament to have defended this treaty much more vociferously , much more offensively and much more openly to the citizens of the European Union and not to have left everything entirely up to governments , which all too often have a rather ambivalent relationship with the progress embodied in this treaty .
In this very week just past , the European Mission in the Middle East has shown us how little political influence we have .
I believe we shall have to organise this industry entirely within the private sector , and that remark is especially addressed to one particular country .
I hope in any case , though , that what comes out of this crisis will be a stronger Europe and a Europe closer to its people .
Only the interplay between the first and second pillars enables both innovative competitiveness and sustainability .
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany .
As well as offering my congratulations to those involved in the outcome of Kyoto , I therefore wish to express the hope that in the new year we shall all find the strength to accomplish the task ahead of the Buenos Aires conference , and I hope in all sincerity that here the support of Parliament will be called upon much more than in the past , for together we can achieve much more for the environment than we ever could by acting in isolation .
That is a milestone , and we keenly await the first evaluation report .
There are some achievements to boast of , but I will not enumerate the different civilian and military missions here .
The successes of the last two summits in Bangkok and London cannot disguise the fact that the ASEM process is not sufficiently dynamic .
There are widely differing views in Parliament on the present Commission proposals on traceability and labelling .
As to whether we need further changes , that is an open question .
Seen from this point of view , it is good if we already start making appropriate preparations now .
Mr Funk said the same this morning .
Thirdly , the existing structures for budgetary decision making are such that it is extraordinarily difficult for fundamental reform to be carried out .
The situation is due , on the one hand - as already mentioned by the Commissioner and some of the previous speakers - to demand from third countries and on the other , to crop failures in traditional agricultural exporting countries such as Australia and New Zealand .
I very much hope it will not take much longer until we really do achieve a basis of trust so that we are not just seen , from the outside too , to be producing hot air but really can also take decisions .
Our citizens , and I do not just mean in these sensitive regions , are counting on the European Parliament and the sense of responsibility of all its members .
Can you guarantee that the free trade agreement will not be put into force until Parliament has approved this procedure and only after Parliament has exercised its rights and adopted the safeguard clauses ?
Madam President , I would like to repeat my point of order :
When our draft was adopted , the Commission promised to incorporate a large number of our amendments .
That is how I see the future role of a Food Safety Agency .
The future of our national economies is too important to us all for us simply to leave them to the dictates of the financial markets .
If we do that , we will be much more successful in our dealings with the Member States than we are at present .
I wish to thank the rapporteur for her courage in including quite a few things in her report .
The Greens &apos; Amendment No 49 also needs to be rejected , as it would reduce the room for manoeuvre that we need .
In this specific case there are two things which , in my view , have not happened and which are nevertheless contained in Resolution 1244 : firstly to disarm the KLA in Kosovo and secondly to disband the KLA in Kosovo .
The individual Member States have the most diverse procedures , which , as a rule , take a very long time .
As an aside , if I may say so , your best decision is sitting on your right .
For this reason , I should like to ask whether the Commission knows of any figures from other industrial centres as to the situation there regarding the reduction of emissions and , secondly , whether the Commission is attempting to influence this .
If we benefit from this , then the other countries will do likewise , and so we should take very careful note of what this study has to say .
We had and still have the problem of incorporating too few if any political controls and finding that the agencies have taken on a life of their own , free of any political control or responsibility .
On a general note , we should also consider whether we could restrict our reliance on rating agencies somewhat because it seems to me that we are much too dependent on them at present .
Unfortunately , it is often the traditional farmers &apos; associations who , in their indiscriminate rejection of reform , forget to draw the attention of their members to new opportunities in good time .
Mr President , I have the impression that Mr Titley &apos; s amendment seeks to delete the first part of Amendment No 25 and vote only on the second part , which he drafted and which was changed to my wording , but not on the first part , which has been withdrawn , unless the Green Group wishes to retain this first part .
All in all , I would like , on behalf of the Commission , to extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Laschet , and to the committees involved , for the work they have done and their commitment in this matter , which has certainly been in evidence during this debate .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the employment summit will be the yardstick for the social profile of Europe .
Then it emerges that this budget line , which was virtually non-existent existent in the past given that it only accounted for ECU 2 million , is to be cut even more under the Council and Commission proposals .
Anyone who fails to comprehend that will truly be letting down postal employees - and Mr Wijsenbeek &apos; s consumers - alike .
Now he suddenly explains that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should not apply in his country .
It is for these that we are aiming with our Amendments 26 , 27 and 32 , along with Amendments 29 and 30 on on-call call services , and these I ask you to support .
I am sure that the Commissioner will do that .
The common position provides for an exception for pollutants from diffuse sources .
It became clear a long time ago that he has the information in the Bellona report from sources that are accessible to the general public .
For a long time , fisheries debates were held in Strasbourg on Fridays .
It obviously supports the aim of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency .
This amendment was , in fact , dealt with when Amendment No 10 was accepted .
As I see it , the first priority is recycling rather than management ; the next is that they be replaced by less toxic contents wherever this is technically possible .
I should like to highlight the discharge given to the Committee of the Regions and to inform the Committee that we are very concerned about its staff policy and that the latest exchanging of posts approved by the budgetary authority with the Economic and Social Committee cannot exactly be regarded as progress .
Fourthly , Albania needs a constitution , particularly for important investment projects .
Now the Member States must implement the citizens &apos; initiative quickly , without wasting time or introducing excessive red tape .
I urge you to have an open discussion with the public about the constitutional project , and , above all , take seriously the serious criticisms that civil society makes of the Convention &quot; s draft .
Mr President , it was said that this was a speech on behalf of our group .
We have implemented a range of measures to push forward the modernisation of the stock of cars on Europe &apos; s roads , by means of which we were , at the same time , pursuing the objective of having a positive impact on the environment .
Let us give even stronger support than before to those circles that want cooperation .
My country , Germany , didn &apos; t want him .
So we must combine efficiency with price if we are to deal with this matter adequately .
Perhaps Commissioner De Palacio will again give some thought to what was said at the first meeting about the issue of linking this with compensation , as this may simplify the practical side of any emergency measures .
I hope that , at noon today , we will be courageous enough to show this to the Council and the Commission by an overwhelming majority .
author . - Mr President , the current behaviour of the government of Ukraine will definitely not make the country &apos; s move into Europe any easier .
Firstly , I hope that we will take the same approach as we did to previous rounds of negotiations ; that we will have talks with the Commission , with the two Commissioners dealing with these matters , and with Commissioner Mandelson in particular , but , of course , also with the Council .
The White Paper is not just about freight ; it is about striking a balance between the various modes of transport by the year 2010 .
How will you evaluate the new specification of specified risk materials , even in the Standing Veterinary Committee ?
I have fundamental confidence in these bodies and we have the task of working with them .
When I came into my office this morning , the door was open , even though I know for sure that I closed it last night , and my computer was switched on , even though I am quite certain that I switched it off last night .
We must be as sure as possible that after a military strike the situation will be better for peace and better for the development of the whole Middle East region .
Quality is a key issue for the entire food chain and an essential asset in supporting the competitiveness of European food producers .
I have been a Member of this House for a while and I have noticed that in cases like yours , when the Council is represented here - even when it is not really necessary - it contributes greatly to the success of a Presidency .
These were attributable to the risks inherent in the transactions themselves and the fact that the supervision and monitoring systems fail to limit the risk of irregularities with an acceptable degree of effectiveness .
You are , of course , quite right to keep reverting to this question .
But now that we have succeeded in ensuring that a separate title in the Council budget includes activities in the area of the common foreign and security policy , this distinction - and hence controls - are guaranteed in an optimum manner .
Here I would , however , make a strong plea in favour of ensuring that in this case the Member States are given as much freedom as possible to use the funds as they see fit .
Mr President , in December 1997 the future of Europe will begin .
The last few times I have listened to you , Mrs de Palacio , I was most impressed by the very clear , very logical and very decisive manner in which you conveyed that .
On this basis , the Employment Summit in Luxembourg agreed upon significant guidelines .
This means that the Commission will always present the reports and suggestions on time .
We are not the Supreme Court .
I would like to extend my sympathy to all of the inhabitants of Madeira affected by the disaster .
As to the issue of relevance , I would remind the House that we are dealing with an issue which , in numerical terms , is of only very limited relevance .
This is about , on the one hand , stabilising the markets by reducing the intervention stocks , while on the other supporting the poorest levels of the population in the Community with food .
We shall certainly have to take issue with the Commission .
I see it as regrettable that the Group of the European People &quot; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats seeks to use this report as a means of engineering changes that belong in the main reform and not here .
That is a proven fact and has been discussed for years in great detail .
As Europeans , we consider it important that Asia should concentrate particularly on including such countries as India and Taiwan in the Asia process .
In addition , we still have a great deal to do in the area of credit rating agencies .
It is not European Union policy to try to bring about change by coercive measures with the effect of increasing the economic hardship of the Cuban people . &quot;
We must draw boundaries ; there is certainly no need for us to tolerate everything .
It expressly rejects a &apos; three-strikes strikes &apos; regulation , which has been discussed as a measure to be used in the event of copyright infringements .
Mr President , Commissioner , you have now often enough heard it said that all of us are opposed to this European programme being handed back to the Member States .
What the Heads of State and Government delivered at the weekend is totally inadequate .
We must , of course , ask ourselves the question : what does accession cost ?
Effective joint action has often been blocked by invoking national sovereignty .
We , as Parliament , are ready to play a part .
Neither , Mr Mulder , is it about not complying with WTO rules and negotiated agreements .
Let me remind you that , in paragraph 3 , we explicitly speak of EU membership as a long-term term objective , as the &apos; ultimate goal in conformity with the Thessaloniki Declaration &quot; , and so what matters , and was our concern in our discussions , is that the prospect of accession be made more credible and tangible , not least for the people of the Western Balkans .
In addition to disaster prevention , the proper application of these European standards is also important , as is the exchange of best practice and helping the Member States to help themselves .
Fourthly , we want more competition between supply sources , which is why we have introduced the principle whereby aid must reflect the costs of transport from the European mainland .
I also do not wish to always make Europe responsible for everything .
As a member of the Convention , I supported the outcome of the proceedings with its overall content in mind , although , like others , I was unable to assent to all the statements made .
The programme that you have presented today , Mr President-in in-Office Office , gives rise to a number of concerns .
The rapporteur proposes that Europe should intervene in the event that Member States fail to provide effective protection of non-smokers smokers in the workplace .
To be quite clear about this , the European car industry must now make efforts across a broad front to bring the types of cars onto the market which we need at the start of the 21st century , in other words , energy-efficient efficient cars with low fuel consumption , which make careful use of resources .
Madam President , I asked the Presidency in this House three months ago , how it was possible for the Dutch President-in in-Office Office of the Council , when asked at the CITES Conference in Zimbabwe what the view of Parliament was , to reply that Parliament does not have a view , even though Parliament in an emergency debate three days earlier had expressed its views perfectly clearly .
If we start demanding the right to interfere in collective bargaining and the resulting agreements , and if we threaten sanctions if the necessary legislation is not complied with , I can only say that although we have to have control , we should ensure a form of communication based on mutual respect .
It is true that important quantities of fish meal will continue to be produced , but not least so that it can be used as fish food on fish farms .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Conference of Presidents has taken a unanimous decision , which I am relaying to you , addressing myself in particular to the Council .
I can cite some successful examples of this approach from my own part of Germany , from Thuringia , which is an Objective 1 area .
The overall situation as far as economic , social and cultural rights are concerned is satisfactory .
The Convention has done an excellent job , so let us get on with it .
We call in this resolution for both countries to make every possible effort to deescalate the situation and join in constructive dialogue in a bid to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible .
EUR 115 million may be a lot of money , but it is spread over five years and the Marco Polo programme is a different situation yet again for all of the measures that were mentioned just now .
I welcome the fact that we are not just discussing these issues today alone .
Ladies and gentlemen , in view of the present importance of this draft directive , as well as its far greater future importance , I do not intend to deal with the opportunities it offers .
This is not just about a few cows and sheep .
We set ourselves the objective of promoting economic and social progress , with a high level of employment as well .
In July of last year - 2005 , that is - six European coordinators were appointed to advance the realisation of five priority transport axes and the introduction of the European Rail Traffic Management System .
As far as the Serbian side is concerned , and there is no need to waste words in passingmoral judgement on Milosevic and other Serb leaders , I just have one concern - and I do not know whether the presidency would like to comment on this - which is that the actions , in themselves perfectly understandable , of the High Representative Carlos Westendorp with regard to Republika Srpska , by being taken at this particular time , just a few days before the Conference reconvenes in Rambouillet , might harden the resolve of the Serbian side .
Many countries , though , have stricter rules of various kinds , so that , for example , credit institutions are already subject to many requirements contained in this directive .
But we should also be guided by reason , wisdom and far-sightedness sightedness .
You win some , you lose some - that is normal .
What I can read between the lines , though , is that the legal position will not be used to keep the unequal treatment in place until Article 202 is amended , but that everything possible is to be done in the meantime to achieve de facto equal treatment of the two legislative bodies in all essential matters .
The right road ahead does not go by way of across-the the-board board cuts , and this House wants what was provided for in the Convention &apos; s draft constitution - full powers of codecision and the abolition of the clear-cut cut dividing line between compulsory and non-compulsory compulsory expenditure .
They also apply , in my opinion , to the budget available for transport .
But we should keep these questions on the agenda and I can only congratulate you on the idea that we should formulate a strategy for drawing up a charter of basic rights .
By way of a concluding comment , let me say that , in amidst the flood of information I have received over the past few days , there is one outstanding piece of news . A few months ago , in this House , we commemorated the victims of the terrorist attack in Beslan .
This question will become that much more relevant the closer EU enlargement towards the East becomes .
Now , in the aftermath of global financial scandals ranging from WorldCom to Parmalat is surely the time for rating agencies to be registered and their practices monitored .
My eleven approaches to a solution are as follows : 1 ) There needs to be a sufficient primary legislative base .
It is also increasingly viewed as a problem by the national courts in the Member States , since in the case of preliminary rulings , the proceedings in the European Court of Justice are merely interim proceedings in the successive stages of appeal through the national courts .
What does the Commission propose to do in order to effectively remove these barriers to trade , most of which do not take the form of tariffs ?
Seventeen service areas , in which local authorities have been involved up to now , must not , however , lead to a situation in which women are dismissed from occupations requiring a high level of qualification , and forced to work in badly paid sectors .
As regards the issue of consumer safety , the task is not only to protect children and older persons as the weaker groups in our societies , which is always emphasised ; safety standards must apply to everyone .
Any other course of action could well send the wrong message to other candidates for accession and would , in the final analysis , be detrimental to the people of Romania and Bulgaria .
This analysis is particularly important for projects that have a biomass component .
In the given circumstances , I believe the Commission has nonetheless submitted proposals that are for the most part viable and at least still give us a chance to master this important process of accession to the European Union and give it a positive shape .
Nor can we have a situation in which the international community sits down at the donor conference , promises money and says to Kosovo and everyone living in the Balkans , we will support you , you will get money for what you want .
According to Commissioner Fischler , people are increasingly turning to cheap supplies once more .
The famous American writer Arthur Miller once said that in the 30s the word Spain was an explosion .
Some Member States are simply not able to take on even more financial burdens .
Policemen have been killed indiscriminately , bombs have been set off in the centre of Katmandu and innocent people have forfeited their lives .
Not that this was ever disputed for the European Central Bank .
After all , the citizen must be able to see that decisions are transparent and sustainable .
Evidently , the proverbial invisible hand of the market cannot even solve this problem within a developed economic area like the European Union .
On the matter itself , however , we entirely agree with him .
SMEs are particularly susceptible to such contemporary phenomena unless these are curbed by means of countermeasures , information , supervision and training .
The IPCC &apos; s Fourth Assessment Report states quite clearly that no region of Europe will be spared its effects .
The biggest problem is with category 4 .
So opportunities were missed , opportunities to promote development but also opportunities to bring the people closer to Europe by making it clear to them that Europe is looking after them too .
Where is this danger that hangs over Europe &quot; s future ?
Why are they not in the Lisbon work programme either ? I do hope there are still changes to be made .
We are assuming that we can implement the project up to 2006 within the framework of the financial perspectives .
European taxpayers would , I believe , not understand it if we simply requested additional funds to finance work in Kosovo without taking the difficult course of prioritisation , which means in practice reallocating funds .
A State of the World Population Report study published by the UN indicates that around 5 000 girls and women , in at least fourteen countries - Pakistan and Turkey among them - are murdered in the name of honour , although the number of such killings that go unreported is much higher .
I would go along with Mr Schiedermeier and Mr McMahon on that .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to stick to the facts and not to things someone has read somewhere .
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years .
The unclear and diverse legal position that we currently have is of no use to anyone , either the culturally creative , the service providers and network operators , or the consumer .
Today we are talking about our dairy farmers and whether we are going to leave them in the lurch or deal with them in an honest manner .
Determining a person &apos; s identity is a precondition for many of these policies .
Should that scenario materialise , we would have no alternative but to revert to the strategy of nuclear deterrence we know from the sixties and seventies .
In the ordinary way of things , we would do that with taxes , but that is not possible .
What is most important , though , is to investigate the causes of the sympathy for the Taliban and of the continuing adulation of them as freedom fighters over wide areas of the country .
We need to discuss the structure of this crisis policy and the alleged policy of solidarity .
Freedom of expression is an important asset , one we must defend and , indeed , for which we have fought long in our societies throughout European history .
Personally , I will also give the green light to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , although I feel I must point out , at the same time , that Serbia &apos; s cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) is still not what it should be .
The European Union as a whole and the euro area in particular are in a grave situation . Greece is on the verge of bankruptcy and Spain and Portugal are also in difficulties .
If we want to seize a new opportunity in the aftermath of the failure of CancÃºn , then we need cooperation with the United States of America , just as we do when it comes to Kyoto and the International Criminal Court .
In many cases , it will be for the Vice-President President of the Commission and her public relations work to deal with that , but the Commission as a whole , along with Parliament , must work at resolving this contradiction .
It is a day that we must keep in our memory in order to remember all those who have been the innocent victims of terrorism .
So we need to make a change and the Council told us , in its answer , that the reason why no change has yet been made is that the Commission has not tabled the necessary proposal .
The Commission is obliged to bring the World Trade Organisation negotiations to a positive conclusion .
We are therefore wondering quite objectively ( and Martin Schulz has done so and I think he is completely right ) who will be deciding the world &apos; s destiny in twenty or thirty years &apos; time ?
However - and I have to say this again and again in this Chamber , and I also say it in Turkey- we are very dissatisfied with the pace of political development .
It is true that a great deal of progress has been made in this area .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first let me thank the rapporteur for presenting this report .
On the contrary , The group of advisers on ethics has proved itself to be a group of hired applauders of the European Commission , and its job is simply to create acceptance for gene technology and biomedicine .
After all , that is what we are now seeing in Bosnia .
That is why , today , we have to come to terms with the concepts and categories as they are currently set out .
It is of course a good thing that they will also enable us to create jobs in Europe .
Fisheries policy is also part of environment policy , because of the significant impact which it has on marine ecosystems .
This is what we expect from the Commission , and then we will be very satisfied .
I would like to point out to the Commission that the way this was handled was very strange and I must also say clearly at this point that this is not the end of the matter .
It has thus become established practice for us to favour Scandinavian earnestness in the budget procedure , and the fact that we additionally had the Danes presiding over the Council , meant that we could find our way around many cliffs at an early stage and make the procedure very harmonious , especially at second reading stage .
These are the tasks for the future and this requires a smarter and bigger budget .
I intend to focus on foreign and security policy aspects which the European Parliament may care to recommend to the Gothenburg Council .
It is certainly not about calling into question the freedom of religion .
The criticisms made by the regional fisheries sector reflected the great anxiety that prevails in that sector at present .
That should also give us food for thought for strategic planning .
They will at long last have to find a way of dismantling them more easily and more cost-effectively effectively .
I think that would be a hypocritical policy .
That is why I would like to recommend to Commissioner Piebalgs the establishment of a prize for energy efficiency for which the whole world can compete , so that we can become acquainted with the best models from all over the world and put them into use as quickly and efficiently as possible ; that way , we in Europe , too , will be able to create new jobs and growth in this new sector .
I should like to take up once more what Mr Brok said about conflict prevention , but also about conflict resolution .
As is the case with many conflicts , our involvement is not a positive one , but rather concerns the fact that our weapons are being used in that country for killing people .
It is simply about leaving an existing agreement in place and let &apos; s face it , the principle of trust always applies when agreements are signed .
As the President-in in-Office Office of the Council said , on that day , 8 May 1945 , lessons had to be learned , and the right ones were .
I do believe , though , that Mrs McKenna is oversimplifying matters with her references to international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
All three components must be equally to the fore of any action we take .
This is the week directly before the Orthodox Easter . It is not Easter itself , but the week before .
What initiative will the Commission take in order to make the Member States more active , however ?
Instead , it is important to try to initiate dialogue with the people and to provide information geared towards specific target groups .
Therefore the directive that we are discussing , on the recognition of qualifications , is intended to help to make such recognition easier and quicker .
The authorities in the Members States should have to observe clear guidelines in this area , to make the process both transparent and humane .
The only great national focal points had hitherto been China &apos; s economic growth and , more recently , the Olympic Games , but in the light of the present disaster , these things almost fail to register any more with many people .
As I see it , this indicates that the Commission is not up to date .
Furthermore , this is another field in which we should learn more from one another , and intensify the exchange of experiences not only among governments but also among the social partners .
We will find our opportunity if we stop setting national interests against European objectives , what nations do against what Europe resolves , the trans-Atlantic Atlantic alliance against a self-confident confident and enlarged European Union .
There are some ways in which it is understandable that the new Member States should be so keen to introduce the euro without much delay .
There is absolutely no doubt that all the pillars are , in principle , equally important components of the strategy .
For example , you order &apos; a Siemens &apos; .
That can help to put terrorists and those behind them out of action more quickly .
What that means is that it is urgently necessary that the Commission should , in awarding subsidies and also funding from the Structural Funds , ensure that the granting of such aid should be conditional upon medium-term term guarantees of permanence and employment .
Nevertheless , the Presidency does not want to let this very important dossier - and especially the political message behind it - come to a complete standstill , and so we shall be holding a seminar on this subject , also in agreement with the Commission and the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia , before the end of our Presidency .
Thirdly , the composition of the Convention must ensure that the principle of political pluralism is guaranteed .
Will we now at last have the proximity to the citizens that we have so often invoked ?
We should not allow workers to be played off against one another , nor should Member States allow themselves to be so , because any such divisions would result in further off-shoring shoring .
The rebuilding of the homes , factories and infrastructure that have been destroyed in the affected areas will take years , and people will not be able to accomplish it on their own .
Somehow , thanks to some very skilful manoeuvring from a handful of people , success was achieved .
The transition to this new approach , indeed , was at the heart of the resolution on the creation of the new Council .
The debate is now adjourned ; it will be resumed this afternoon at 3 p.m .
- The proposals in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen Leinen report with regard to the reform of the Treaties in their institutional core areas provide for an extension of the qualified majority decision in the Council .
This will halt the trend in this specific sector , where emission levels have been rising rapidly , increasing by 73 % between 1990 and 2003 .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think it is most important that we should remind ourselves that the Commission really is , in this respect , the guardian of Community law and that it regards the two European anti-discrimination discrimination directives as the fundamental instrument in the fight against inequality .
With these keys , they can open the door to an open market , but they can also close it .
Mr President , Mr President-in in-Office Office , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by extending my warmest thanks to Mr Morillon and Mr SeppÃ¤nen for their highly constructive and politically intelligent reports and to say that this debate is taking place at a most auspicious time , a time when we are in a position to set relations between the European Union and Turkey on what may prove to be a decisive course .
It has submitted proposals for completing the trans-European European networks and has also made financial commitments in this connection .
Finally , it is unacceptable that we are reaching a point where no one knows what they are doing any more , and that the reason for this is to be found , above all , in the bureaucratic procedures in Brussels and the Commission .
That , however , is untenable , not only in this case , in which , after all , aid funds amounting to ECU 2.4 million were misappropriated - not embezzled in the legal sense , but nevertheless channelled into other directions .
The Solidarity Fund is an instrument of aid , one that makes immediate aid possible and whose tasks must be clearly distinguished from those of the Structural Fund .
I should particularly like to mention Senegal as a positive example , where religious and political leaders have worked together to halt the spread of AIDS through prevention .
What they do indicate is that someone believes they have been on the receiving end of unfair treatment and wants to do something about it .
A crucial starting point for this is the electronic signature .
This is , by the way , already provided for in the rules of the WTO .
Mr President , Commissioner , allow me to start by thanking Mr Morillon for his extremely factual report and his conscious effort to stick to the point .
In view of the very divergent rules on takeover bids in the various Member States , the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights and my group rightly asked whether a recommendation might not have been more appropriate than a directive .
No matter which way we decide , this is a new dimension .
Mr President , Commissioner , Madam President-in in-Office Office of the Council , the railway package is an interesting trilogy , and all trilogies contain an element of drama .
As we know , the rapid pace of technological development had rendered the old Directive obsolete .
We have complained enough about Commissioners here , but we can also give praise where praise is due .
I shall not mince my words - I believe that this is a colonial war driven by the energy interests of Gazprom and others .
The fact that micro-entities entities are subject to obligations by this directive , namely the drawing up of accounts , which , in terms of their structure and the elements they contain , are essentially the same as those required from large companies , completely overlooks what is actually necessary , as well as the needs of micro-entities entities .
Mr President , Mr Fischler , like my colleagues I have been listening to you attentively , and you will not be surprised to hear that what you have said certainly does not make us all perfectly happy .
Secondly - and you , Mr Commissioner , can be sure that you will hear from us when the time comes to consider the successor to ALTENER II in the energy framework programme . We expect that there will be a significant increase there as well .
If , however , we then follow the discussion further into the realm of practical implications , we are told that there is no need to alter the practical policy guidelines .
Portugal &apos; s reputation has grown with this Presidency , specifically thanks to three things , which you yourself have mentioned .
rapporteur . - Mr President , Vice-President President , representatives of the Czech Presidency , ladies and gentlemen , as the previous speakers have said , this is a great moment , not because our reports are being discussed , but because today it has been established that the parliaments of 26 countries have ratified the Treaty of Lisbon , and that a referendum , which has been promised , still has to be carried out in just one country .
Not only a loss in confidence between a few Members of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Commission .
We must work on the gains in internal security .
Is the Commission really siding with the employers again ?
If we want to get to the roots of war and aggression we need to ask ourselves how such situations arise in the first place .
The industrialised states , above all the fifteen EU states , can very definitely be considered rich in economic terms , and if they are not in the lead by miles , we cannot demand that the developing countries make sacrifices .
The agreements with Kazakhstan , the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan have already entered into force , while the agreement with Tajikistan has not yet been ratified by all Member States .
I prophesy this to you : After all we have experienced in the Council , after all Italy &apos; s stonewalling in the interest of its Prime Minister , I tell you here and now that the same Prime Minister will now hold a referendum in order to prevent the European arrest warrant from being effective in Italy .
That is why I , along with many other Members who have addressed the House today , am appealing earnestly for a strengthening of the position of holders of rights , in other words those who want to have their copyrights protected .
I believe the parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee fought very hard before reluctantly consenting to the result of the conciliation process , and that is also how my group will vote in the Chamber .
Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , that is something on which the Council remains silent .
Finally , I would like to emphasise , once again , what many of you have said , which is that we must think beyond the motor industry when we discuss the current crisis .
Nevertheless , we would do well not to forget that for all the fine words uttered , the crucial negotiations for peace in the Middle East take place in the USA and not in Europe .
So we should not hesitate over the last component of the legislation , and we should opt for the Conciliation Committee route in this case as well , because the Council has obviously not dared to make that final leap and has been very cautious on a couple of points .
I believe it is absolutely essential to endorse these two amendments .
The Commission has also intensified its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation as a whole for the purpose of promoting these objectives .
What is more , they must be consulted from the outset . Despite all the important points made in this report , despite the planned request to the Commission to first of all draw up a study , and despite the call for a broad-ranging ranging debate on the effectiveness of the OCM , I still have serious reservations about a method that takes this form and is based on these principles .
This in turn will put the start of accession talks with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe at risk .
Just as we demand it of the European Central Bank in the dialogue , we must also call for greater transparency on the part of the Council of Finance Ministers , the Jumbo Council , the Social Affairs Council and the European Council , and demand direct European Parliament participation .
We will certainly have to discuss that on another occasion .
Yes , esteemed colleagues , you have understood me correctly .
Some of my colleagues - particularly those from the southern European countries - support the Commission &apos; s and Council &apos; s proposal to continue with the Cohesion Fund in its present form .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are delighted to see that you have arrived safely , Commissioner .
That is important if we really want to strike at the roots of the intolerance and xenophobia that are once more rearing their heads in Europe .
Rather than the pressures of regulation , we want more competition .
It is inconceivable that an attempt is now clearly being made to punish the bearer of those ill tidings , the financial controller , for what has happened here .
If you had included a restriction , you would also have had no disagreement with the USA .
Those who hire workers who do not have work permits should be excluded from being awarded public contracts .
Madam President , I had asked the administration to ensure that the Members of the Charter Convention be officially notified to Parliament and I was assured that this would be done .
These are matters that will have to be resolved in the Convention , that really need to be organised elsewhere .
The result of this law is that those in power will monitor the media .
It goes without saying that our national investigating authorities must cooperate more closely .
Over the past ten years , global arms expenditure has increased by 37 % .
Madam President , I would like to praise the exemplary activity of the French security service during the visit by Tony Blair .
Improving the protection of the euro against fraud is a welcome development , which is why I , too , voted in favour of the Diaz de Mera report .
The point is , can we find a solution within the framework of the 1999 comitology decision ?
Mr Newens , with that question you have very accurately described the problem we are facing and that we have not managed to resolve so far . On the one hand we want to protect the banana producers with whom we have very close links ; on the other hand , however , we have to respect the WTO rules .
Mr President , I wanted to speak on the same point , and I my point is this : for over eighteen years - since the first European election - evening sessions and Friday sessions were reported by our information services in the same way as all other sessions .
The political nature of the discharge procedure , which I have just mentioned , does not mean that the Commission can simply collect broken promises and let them mount up endlessly .
There will only be unity in the country if there is renewed trust in the political and economic elite there .
Mr President , this draft regulation is one of the first regulations in the sphere of development policy to be adopted by means of the codecision procedure .
Does that include snails ?
That is why I urge you to support Amendment No 133 .
These will then be dealt with at the spring meeting of the Council in March , which gives the European Parliament ample opportunity to voice its opinion on the specific initiatives and proposals before the final decision is taken in March of next year .
Other points of criticism include , for example , the fact that some of the rules are so complex that those who are not initiated into their mysteries cannot understand them , or the excessively lengthy times allowed for the checks to be adapted .
As an Austrian member , I must also address the sanctions of the 14 in connection with Lisbon .
After such a heated and ideological debate I think that we should now give priority to the question of exactly what these concrete steps should be .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as the Commissioner has pointed out , this budget covers a broad spectrum of activities .
In my opinion there is a great deal to be done , and if need be we must put the situation right by means of directives .
Many thanks , then , Mr Ahern ; as we journey towards a renewed constitution , we need you , and we thank you for your encouraging speech .
To my mind , better governance , efficient and transparent governance , would be rather different from these debates at such an ungodly hour .
This will cost hundreds of millions of euros , but the radioactive waste will remain a permanent risk factor which will endanger the health and safety of future generations .
I admit that is asking a lot of you .
Our task is to exercise democratic control , although , at this stage , I would prefer to speak of parliamentary guidance . There are , however , certain questions we must ask .
In other words , they should be providing services rather than simply selling something .
It is a Euratom matter , so there is nothing more to be said .
Most of the crime which harms the Community budget is also organised crime . The rapporteur is right there .
Symbolism is fine on one day - International Women &quot; s Day ; we now have 365 of them , full of work to be done .
I believe that introducing new European Treaty Articles and legal provisions goes against the principle of subsidiarity .
We will continue to consider this issue in the Women &quot; s Committee and will not stand idly by .
This is another reason why I am particularly pleased that a delegation from the European Parliament will be attending the session as part of the delegation from the European Communities .
Normally , they are the blockers . But then we tried to find a solution , and the Commissioner was very helpful , but the Council was obdurate .
It is important , therefore , that training and career improvement are supported , and it is quite impossible to understand how , when that is being discussed , Leonardo funds should be considered for cuts , to give just one example .
It is surely a question of whether the city that is awarded the honorary title of European capital of culture can indeed live up to that title .
He has renounced violence ; he has recognised the State of Israel &quot; s right to exist , and the Commission must consider in what ways this might be given shape in terms of actions and support .
In the dimension currently taken by the European economy , the definition of small and medium-size size enterprises as set out by the European Union is simply wrong : it includes too few businesses .
An end to the illegal war and the occupation of Iraq is imperative .
The population needs increasing levels of security .
Mr President , Item 18 of the Minutes - the debate on the European Fraud Investigation Office - is mentioned only very briefly ; neither the Council president nor the Members who spoke are mentioned .
Mr President , Madam President-in in-Office Office , Commissioner , in principle I quite agree with the basic points you made .
It is gratifying to learn that the Council has now decided to treat this financial package as additional .
In Parliament &apos; s report , for example , it is proposed that the European Union must finally acquire the ability to act - an ability to act based upon credible military resources .
I do not agree with all the points in it , but I am very pleased that Mrs LÃ¶sing did make use of this option .
The views within my own group about the proposed buy-back back programme also diverge widely .
The fifth issue is that of fund processing , in respect of which the industry is making promising efforts , and so we should place our trust in it and take it as read that it will sort out the problems on its own initiative .
I am very sparing with my words of thanks , which makes them all the more significant .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the impending enlargement presents the European Union with its most important challenge since its foundation .
It makes a practical , and not merely a rhetorical contribution to the implementation of freedom of movement and the internal market , as laid down in the European Community Treaties .
The oceans are transport routes , sources of raw materials and energy , suppliers of foodstuffs and water reservoirs .
I believe that a common European market , a domestic market and an optimal currency area must incorporate a corresponding infrastructure and transport infrastructure .
Even before the Green Paper appeared , it called in several resolutions for better protection for EU finances through the establishment of a European prosecutor for financial matters , who would deal with the growing number of cases of cross-border border crime affecting the EU budget .
The next important step is to raise the simplification threshold to a minimum of EUR 200 000 .
All of them gave rise to controversy .
I have just addressed this subject in some detail , admittedly in a rather descriptive form , by explaining the relevant sensitivities in the realm of African countries , particularly within the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , which has competence in the region .
That is the standard we will continue to apply .
Although we could help the countries with the greatest economic problems in the monetary union to obtain money on favourable terms , for example , by means of a Union loan to several euro area states , this favourable external credit would hardly be able to alleviate the acute problems they are facing and would also do nothing about the causes of the problems .
In our opinion , the rapporteur &apos; s last amendment is also logical if , as I said to begin with , we do not regard this as the final step .
That , and nothing else , is what it is about ; it is something one can vote for .
The Council has therefore been invited to reintroduce , with immediate effect , the sanctions against the regime which had been temporarily suspended .
It is a good thing that the workforce are refusing to be no more than chess pieces for the global players who no longer take it as read that businesses have any responsibilities to society .
Now they are paying the price .
Over the last 18 months a lot of people have asked me , &apos; What is all this that you are doing in Europe with electronic waste ?
Thus , for example , that which we deem to be Austrian in our own culture is ultimately the product of a heritage drawn from European sources , from an awareness of the significance of the Central European area , from the historical and human links we have with the people of this region , from our practical experience of federalism and subsidiarity , and from the insight our common history has given us , namely that supranationality in no way implies the loss of one &apos; s own identity .
They must even be able to vent their anger on occasion so that this European model can work .
In fact , on the question of embryo protection , the USA are more stringent than the group of advisers of the European Commission , because in the USA at least there is no public money for expensive embryo research .
You can gladly speak , Sir , when you have been allocated speaking time , but you will not steal the time allocated to myself !
Many of us will be in Washington in the next few days , where we will have the opportunity to hold discussions with our colleagues from Congress .
What we instead need is a debate on measures to enhance Frontex so as to provide maximum security at the external borders of the European Union - thereby ensuring freedom of movement - and a debate on speedy asylum proceedings and managed migration , on cooperation to deal with the causes of migration and on readmission agreements .
Waste from the extractive industries amounts to some 400 million tonnes per annum , equivalent to 29 % of the waste produced by the Community as a whole .
It is not acceptable for this man to freely trample the dignity of this House underfoot .
The draft has nothing to say about this .
An economic landscape that is overclouded by investment fatigue will not bring forth the necessary growth or the necessary crop of jobs .
Mr President , the report on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement takes account of the new democratic developments in Croatia and highlights the European prospects for this country , which has managed in the course of the past year to achieve its aim of joining the international community of states .
Even if this no longer survives , many recommendations by this institute are still of particular importance for the European Central Bank .
The new decision is intended to go one step further and to accept and emphasise the challenges of European integration , of European diversity and also that of expanding cultural cooperation within an enlarged Europe .
In this regard , the Austrian Presidency , in close cooperation with the Commission , will hold intensive talks with the Presidency of the Council of Europe , which , as you know , will be held by Romania for the next six months , so that this important document can be finalised in the next few months .
Mr President , the topical and urgent debate on the street children of Moscow really highlights two different problems that have accompanied the massive political and economic upheavals in Russia .
However , this only minimally attains the objective of ensuring that the shareholders of listed companies will enjoy equal protection in the single market in the event of a takeover .
Achieving that was a major step forward , and , while I wish its neighbour Serbia would do likewise , this work must nonetheless be proceeded with in the immediate future .
It was as early as the International Women &apos; s Day in 1998 that European women started the &apos; Flower for the Women of Kabul &apos; campaign , and deplored the human rights violations that excluded women in particular from education , medical treatment , work and political involvement .
As regards Mrs Roth-Behrendt Behrendt &apos; s allegation , I did not accuse her of lying .
Let me reiterate that our first objective must now be to ensure that Israel transfers Palestinian tax revenues to the Authority .
But I also know that if we are unable to administer such programmes properly , afterwards the frustration is greater than the success .
In the health sector , I regard the cautious and progressive introduction of statistical returns , hand in hand with in-depth depth feedback from the personnel involved , as the right way ahead .
It is very regrettable , as you said , that at the Council meeting in December valuable time was lost arguing about the allocation of possible fish , which may not longer exist , rather than spending the time on dossiers on which Parliament had already expressed its view .
I wish us the success that the European idea deserves and I look forward to a second discussion with you after the conclusion of the PÃ¶rtschach and Vienna summits .
Since you mention sport , I had a look at the French newspapers this morning , wondering what they would write today about Mr Sarkozy &apos; s visit to the European Parliament .
The Commission will have a clear right to be heard at Council level because there can be no doubt that a common market requires common rules .
The objectives of the CARDS programme were in fact all right .
We are so pleased that the Treaty of Lisbon is finally in force , yet when faced with our first challenge after Lisbon , we let the tabloid press and armchair politics win out over reason .
It should always be carried out within the meaning of the Lisbon process .
My own country found this a very worthwhile exercise and I think that this is an approach which we should support in this specific case , so that good neighbourly relations can develop in the future between Turkey and Armenia .
That is why I hope Parliament will speak with a clear voice and that there will be a large majority tomorrow .
There is just one aspect that I would like to pick out - that of care .
The Constitution is not dead , for people &quot; s need for a future in which they can live in Europe in freedom and peace at home and abroad lives on as an objective in their hearts and minds , and the Constitution is a crucial step in moving towards a social order , a political architecture , a political space , in which such a future is possible .
Unemployment , social exclusion and anti-social social elements are still present in our society and are being exploited by the extreme right in their campaign against Europe .
I long for a presidency that will finally get together with the Commission to examine the education system in Europe and conclude , as did the neo-liberal liberal OECD , that the German and Austrian systems are the pits , because they simply do not guarantee equality .
Your House has repeatedly urged that it be allowed sufficient time to carefully elaborate its position , since the tight deadlines involved in the annual employment cycle usually made it necessary to invoke the urgency procedure .
It takes as its starting point the freedom to provide services and goes on to regulate what is to be done with that freedom .
You have said something about that .
The city is completely divided and is becoming more markedly so day by day .
This is the answer to these challenges .
If we are to do this , the EU must have more influence within the United Nations .
Reducing appropriations for social tasks in order to fund foreign policy challenges is not a solution .
I do not think that they need to do that , yet all the same , we , in the industrialised states , must declare ourselves willing to return some of the benefits we have gained over the past few hundred years from our former colonies , some of the wealth we have accumulated at the cost of their poverty , to those states , not least in order to give them answers to their questions as to how they can drive forward their own economic and social development without damaging the climate .
Secondly , I should like to raise an objection to the comparison of the Council with the Mafia .
There is sufficient untapped potential in this area .
In this regard , you have our support .
I think the parallels between then and now are quite amazing .
In my view , a register of lobbyists is long overdue .
In this way Brussels is becoming increasingly remote from those it claims to represent , and that is bad for democracy .
Whilst we have to use the Member States &quot; competences , this is something we have to bring together at the European level .
Even if we do , the question arises of whether we can do it within the time allowed for implementation .
The decision as to whether Greece should be admitted to the euro zone ought not to be taken lightly .
I believe we need to add two things to the overall range of issues just mentioned on the political and economic agenda , and we should do this in the next half year . Firstly , we should bring people more into the dialogue we are conducting .
People must be told what is at stake , and we must address the anxieties , concerns and fears that are associated with enlargement and tell our people quite openly and clearly what we are doing to ensure that the contingencies they fear will not materialise .
This is what you have said , Mr LÃ³pez Garrido and Mr Rehn .
The resources could be used , in the context of promoting milk sector sales , for better nutritional information and also for further accompanying measures such as modernising milk production , in areas where conditions are more difficult and in mountainous regions .
A revised version has been made necessary , among other things , by the completion of the European single market .
If this idea were generally welcomed in Europe it would of course also be necessary to reach agreement on the technicalities involved , for example , on how the decision to mount an EU-wide wide referendum of this kind might be taken .
We know that we must improve this TACIS programme , but we also know that preparatory work is essential for our future cooperation between Russia and the European Union .
It is , then , with the interests of these in mind that we need to get to work .
No , it was possible to implement it . The Lisbon strategy failed due to the reluctance of the Member States to keep their own promises .
Sweden showed us how the wrong budgetary policy in the Member States can influence the vote .
Three months ago , at the April plenary part-session session , we adopted a resolution in which we say everything that it is possible for us to say about Iraq .
You know what it is to cooperate with the European Parliament in a very wide range of situations .
In view of the budget situation and the Berlin decisions , any proposal that would have led to substantial increases in budgetary expenditure in favour of a specific sector would have been unrealistic .
And , since the Intergovernmental Conference is producing no genuine progress in this area , I fear that such reports are going to take the same form in the future .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thousands of women have petitioned Parliament to take a stand on the dangers inherent in the use of silicone breast implants .
Thirdly , the issue of providing information to consumers on preparation and production methods , commonly referred to as PPMs , and the possibility for Member States to take non-discriminatory discriminatory measures .
We have nothing against the EU providing technical assistance with assessing the impact of the establishment of free trade and economic regions in Africa , but we vigorously oppose the opening of negotiations being made dependent on this , which could lead to reform of relations between the EU and the ACP States being blocked for a long time .
I agree with you that the marketing of antique measuring instruments should indeed continue to be permitted , &apos; antique measuring instruments &apos; being those that are at least 50 years old , and , being in the main collectors &apos; items , they are , by reason of their value , handled with very great care , traded only in very limited numbers , and the risk of such items ending up in waste is minimal .
We have therefore proposed to the Commission that an appropriately staffed &apos; development unit &apos; be set up to undertake continuous work in this area .
The European Union &apos; s new policy on the use of pesticides is an important step towards better health and environmental protection .
All these advantages have led to the fact that organized crime in our society and our state is spreading and will finally undermine our society .
Given these pre-conditions conditions , I nonetheless consider the Commission &apos; s communication to be a practically focused measure which may be extremely helpful .
In the final analysis , all of this is pointless if checks on foodstuffs in and around contaminated regions do not really work .
Although I cannot therefore accept these amendments , I have no problems with the underlying message , which it is worth conveying , and that is that the current range of products needs to be reviewed , and I will ensure that this issue continues to be dealt with and discussed in the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products .
That is why we , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , have an interest in the success of your Presidency .
I could add more examples , such as the French &apos; PÃ´les de CompÃ©titivitÃ© &apos; , the Dutch Standard Cost Model or tax reforms in some of the new Member States .
This leads me directly on to the matter of the catalogue of competences .
In reply to what you said about agricultural expenditure , let me point out the following : this year , given the fluctuations in the exchange rates , we will be spending about EUR 500 million less on agriculture and the estimates for next year are that we will need about 650 million less , assuming a parity euro-dollar dollar rate .
I hope that the governments will heed this warning .
The figures which you have given tally exactly with my own figures .
The really major revision will be in 2004 , when we will certainly put our heads together and draw up sensible amendments for them .
I can fully understand that you did not wish to come here with a negative report .
As yet , these institutions have no access to State aid .
Both foreign secretaries did a great deal to foster a climate conducive to further progress in the region .
The debate this evening is an opportunity to lay the issues on the table , and I hope that we will also come to some conclusions .
I think it is obvious that - as Mr Watts said - the only issue left to discuss is that of the voyage data recorder .
Unfortunately , I cannot say the same thing about my fellow Members .
We welcome your initiative in calling for a Balkan conference to discuss political , economic and social reconstruction in this stricken region .
Here , I think , Europe is sending out the right message , and that is what the public expect of us .
We know that petrol and oil are sources of benzene , and in the European Union 80 to 85 % of benzene emissions result from petrol combustion in road vehicles .
History teaches us that this approach has failed .
The negotiations between the United States and the EU that culminated in the agreement of July 2007 on the transfer of passenger name records showed that it was scarcely possible for the Union to secure US acceptance of any of its positions .
Even here in this House , people had some misguided ideas , which manifested themselves in attempts to block the directive itself or make it easier for the Member States to erect barriers within the internal market .
We have speeded up our work and we will still be able to work after the policy has been adopted and the resolution has been passed .
Mr President , speaking on behalf of our group , I would like to ask for something that does not involve changing the agenda , but simply adding to the title .
However , today is officially Parliament &apos; s last sitting .
&quot; We do not have the wherewithal for that , &quot; they said .
The Stability Pact , one of the foundations of our single currency , is in jeopardy , and the single currency is one of the pillars of this entire Union .
The negotiations were long and hard .
The enlargement of the European Union represents a gain both for the European Union and for the candidates for accession and is an indispensable prerequisite for peace , stability and prosperity in a reunited Europe .
No other course would be possible , because there is no legislative process which is fast enough to allow further changes to be made in May .
Do we have to wait until these people commit a terrorist act before we are permitted to deport them , or before they cease to enjoy the rights of visitors ?
This preparatory work formed a good basis for the detailed discussions in the Council bodies , and proved to be useful in that we reached agreement on the aforementioned Council conclusions .
There is a great longing for normality in Serbia .
The first is that we are closer to completing the internal market .
You , Commissioner , thanked the rapporteur for the energy he has invested in this ; we should be grateful for the energy with which you are following this project &quot; s progress .
Some people say in all seriousness that the decline in fishery stocks is caused solely by fishing .
Martin Bartenstein , the Minister for Economics and Labour , who is responsible for energy affairs , then had the task of seeking solutions with our partners - the Ukrainians , the Russians and our European partners - and with Commissioner Piebalgs .
Measures against terrorism often have fatal consequences for peace and democracy and can be used as a pretext for promoting other interests .
If these tankers had been carrying biofuels then the damage would , God knows , not have been as devastating , and biofuels do not need to be transported across the oceans either .
We also need clear rules and bans .
As a result , I believe that we must place the tax code of conduct within the principles of free but fair competition .
Human weaknesses have continued to play a role in Japan right up to the present .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by expressing my special thanks to Mr Szenja , the rapporteur in the lead committee , for our close and fruitful cooperation .
Mr Balkenende , I listened with great attention when you said you wanted to concentrate your efforts on combating terrorism and also on a new policy on drugs .
Creating transport connections and removing traffic bottlenecks in less favoured or remote regions is another important step .
Delays , longer flight routes resulting in extra congestion , and the increasing number of accidents and incidents are a burden on the European economy , on the airlines and not least on us consumers .
The Goma Conference on peace , security and development opened a few days ago .
However , I am also shocked at how radical treatment still is in many Member States .
In areas where decisions are within the competence of Member States , we in the European Parliament can highlight changes and desirable improvements .
For this reason , we were not able to give our support to this negotiating mandate , despite the fact that we believe that much of it is correct .
There are also many other issues which play a role in the negotiations .
The call for compatibility between new systems and with existing systems is in line with Parliament &apos; s demands .
The parliament immediately , and of its own free will , admitted responsibility for the whole of German history . It bowed its head before the victims and guaranteed our Polish neighbours secure borders .
But we need decisions to be made quickly so that genuine refugees - who make up about 10 % of applicants - can be helped swiftly and so that repatriation can be arranged for the remaining 90 % that have to be rejected .
We cannot have a race to the bottom here when we are making an agreement that is primarily aimed at protecting our citizens . Such protection - the protection of personal data and the safeguarding of privacy - is laid down in a multitude of ways in articles contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the European Convention on Human Rights and the Treaty of Lisbon .
It is high time that we made progress - by creating a confidence offensive .
This applies , for example , to proposed Amendment No 20 .
But if Member States are to continue to be able to apply for increases in capacity for measures designed to improve on-board board safety and fishery product hygiene and these are to be paid for out of FIFG resources , something really must be done to ensure that those measures do not result in increased fishing .
I would like to touch on a few of the important points , but I will not shrink from mentioning the controversial aspects either .
I then explain to them that the market organisation needs to be reformed in order that sugar beet may continue to be cultivated in Europe in the future .
In our view , there is a need to put forward ambitious objectives and pragmatic specific measures , with new and innovative approaches and more local and regional initiatives - all of which you have included in your report .
It provides a great deal of information without anticipating decisions which we have yet to debate intensively .
I would underline the fact , however - and this is the point the honourable Member is making - that the Community support framework is , in any case , at present totally oversubscribed .
It is for this reason that we are building a strategic partnership , which has been embodied in the four common areas , for example , and the common energy policy , which will be formulated in such a way as to prevent onesided dependence on our part . The events that will take place in 2007 , and our joint preparations for these events , will also be a focus for this strategic partnership , as 2007 will see the expiry of the partnership and cooperation agreements , the holding of elections in Russia and the planned entry of Russia into the WTO .
Russia is always trying to play the EU Member States off against one another because that is , of course , more satisfying for our partners .
Poorly planned introduction of European monetary union would result in the dollar extending its present dominant position still further .
I want us to succeed in introducing parliamentary control and establishing democratic relations between the Congress and the European Parliament in the ensuing discussions .
Important , here , is the progress that has been made in the third pillar - and I shall just mention Europol in this context - and particularly the economic and social components , in which the employment situation and the strong joint efforts that are being made to improve it are given the highest priority .
Let me make that crystal-clear clear , particularly in the light of some recent events .
Mr President , Mr President of the Court of Auditors , Members of the Court of Auditors , ladies and gentlemen , the Court has been unstinting in its support for the Commission &quot; s reforms , and acknowledges in its report for 2002 that these have made good progress .
I would like to congratulate the Danish Presidency of the Council on the result achieved at Copenhagen , but I must also take this opportunity to thank Mr BÃ¶ge , Parliament &apos; s rapporteur on the financing of enlargement , for his support over the past year and a half .
That is the only way to guarantee the destruction of foot and mouth and swine-fever fever pathogens .
While their companies are making profits on the European internal market , Germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by Europe .
The Members who called for that will recall that I said that we had no idea what the other groups &apos; positions were .
I would like to say that we should also make it clear to the citizens of Europe that we must modify the European budget .
That brings me on to a really fundamental issue , that of the WTO and Russia .
The political intention to reform the Stability and Growth Pact will shake the very foundations of the Maastricht Treaty and of European monetary union .
As the renewal of the agreement apparently brings economic and social advantages for both sides , it is also in the interests of the European Union .
The measures proposed are a step in the right direction , and I have voted for the report .
Once the Commission has arrived at its conclusions , it will forward a proposal to the Council , which will then have a month in which to decide whether or not to agree to it .
Now , though , we see the Council adopting , through the back door , an extensive remodelling of agricultural funding , and this House has no option but to kill it off , for there was no prior consultation with us .
Instead of constantly hatching new projects you should do your homework .
For this reason , I am making an urgent plea that Amendment No 117 and , of course , Amendment No 123 be adopted so that our ship , the research vessel for the future , can stay on an even keel and steer the proper course .
It is obvious to all of us that we now need to act quickly , and , in particular , to be thorough in examining what caused this .
In a year &apos; s time , we will measure your success in terms of what you have done with the many additional posts which have been created . So this issue will undoubtedly arise once again during the next budgetary procedure , including the discharge procedure .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , G20 is indeed the right way forward ; in time G8 will have to be dissolved by G20 .
Your proposals , suggestions and concerns will , of course , also be taken into account in preparing and elaborating the report on 2002 , work on which has already started .
These are undoubtedly issues which will also be raised in this context and consequently I expect the ASEM summit to make progress in this area .
Moreover , I would draw your attention to the fact that the volume of turnover is significantly greater in the United Kingdom than in many other Member States .
They ensured that there was a massive cut in the Structural Funds and were therefore the first to call economic and social cohesion into question .
The digital divide between the Member States is something that the Fifteen - who will soon be joined by another Ten ! - must sort out among themselves , but the digital divide in our societies is a matter of concern for all of us .
Work is simultaneously in progress on drawing up the 2003 Budget , which is expected to be the last Budget for an EU of fifteen Member States .
The rapporteur has succeeded both in highlighting the improvements achieved in the wake of the 2000 reform of the Structural Funds and also in drawing our attention to difficulties in their application , especially the problems in connection with the delayed implementation of the programme .
If they are obliged to comply with something , they start by setting up committees and commissions , interministerial , extraministerial , every sort of committee under the sun .
It is also in our interests - in the very objective interests of the Member states of the European Union and of that Union as a whole .
Two thirds of our workers work for these enterprises and they generate 50 % of gross domestic product .
In other words , we need greater reliability and we need to be able to plan ahead .
When it comes to reforming European policies , you gain in credibility if you leave no room for doubt about your European vocation , and I ask that you make this clear during your Presidency .
Agencies are European administrative units , although they have a unique nature .
In preparing these remarks today , I recalled what I learned at school about the United Kingdom : 10 April 1912 was the date of another launch of a hi-tech tech future for Europe .
There are still several issues that need to be resolved in Bulgaria and Romania .
My proposal for burdens to be shared out fairly between the Member States , thus guaranteeing planning and funding , was of course rejected .
We are merely asking for the vote to be postponed .
That was not the case , however .
Mr Kuckelkorn wrote to you as long ago as 17 January to point out the problems brought in its train by Parliament &apos; s alleged need for security , which has been taken to the point of absurdity after 11 September , and he counselled common sense .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , let me also begin my speech by thanking Mr Grosch once again , in particular for the well-balanced balanced nature of his proposals with regard to the prescribed amount of regulation , because this provided a platform from which we were able to reach a very broad consensus on many points .
Mr President , I would like to thank both the presidency and Mrs Bonino and her colleagues very sincerely for the fact that we reached an agreement in the trialogue that was accepted by both the Council and by Parliament &apos; s delegation .
This report turns to the young people - in this case in Poland and the Slovak Republic , previously ( in fact last year ) in Romania , Hungary and the Czech Republic .
Mr President , it has already been said that our group will approve the Council proposal .
The second is the need for the sustainable development of high-grade grade , quality products using clean technology , i.e. not environmental after-care care when the damage has been done , but environmentally compatible products and processes .
I would like to clarify this in the light of one particular example : Mr SeppÃ¤nen &apos; s speech .
Sometimes , however , you have to admit - as with many things in life - when things are not working , and you have to consider alternatives .
We must now respond to its efforts .
This process is not only unstoppable , it is also explicitly desirable , and to be desired , moreover , with the utmost ardour !
We should therefore take stock of the situation for the first time at the Employment Summit to be held during the Portuguese Presidency .
As I have already said , the role of the national courts must be to ensure , on the basis of the fundamental rights clause , that the fundamental rights of our citizens are not infringed .
We have no intention of allowing an excellent bill to be ruined for the sake of an amateur law in the fight against crime !
We ought to make it clear that we are a European Parliament which covers a large area and has a certain method of working .
If the conclusions of a series of tests carried out in this way prove positive , then a method of treatment will have fulfilled the requirements of conventional medicine for verifiable and comprehensible operating mechanisms .
People must be allowed to choose for themselves in matters of information .
I believe that the position proposed by Mr Ahtisaari is , in essence , the path we should take .
The truth is , in my opinion , that the presidency of the Council is rather relieved to have this as an argument for not opening up a Pandora &apos; s box .
We clearly need more Europe .
It is neither necessary nor meaningful to prescribe in detail how these countries should organise their economy or their education and science policies , or the details of how they regulate their foreign policy .
The legal situation is unclear .
Provisions relating to medicinal products should only apply to products that have a therapeutic benefit and are used therapeutically .
The amendment in question , No 20 , is directed not only at the purchasers - the television providers - but also at the sports organizations , who must be at least as interested in their spectators as we are in our electorate .
The fact that they do not absolutely have to agree in their assessments has something to do with the way in which everyone stresses the need for the Pact to be adhered to and our need for rules , without it being clear how effective a pact of this kind can be when it deals only with sanctions for when things are going badly and makes no provision for the Commission to have a role when things are going well .
It has also made it possible to confer greater powers on EU inspectors in the field of monitoring and control .
In my constituency , as you know , there is a problem with customs clearance at the Swiss border .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission &apos; s White Paper on modernisation of the European competition rules has ignited intense and lively debate amongst interested members of the public .
We are on the verge of an extremely important decision , not only in terms of its impact on all of Europe but also , in this age of globalisation , in its effects on the political map of the world .
Nevertheless , in the short term there will be tremendous pressure as they adjust to specific problems arising out of the very different levels of development , especially in the social field .
The procedures are clearly described in the Maastricht Treaty , and they are echoed in the Stability Pact . Each has its part to play - the Commission just as much as the Council of Finance Ministers .
The ways in which various associated charges are calculated must also be both comparable and transparent .
She is very committed to her work there , and unfortunately the true message about this commitment is not being properly reflected in the contribution being made here today .
The procedures are not sufficiently precise and leave room for interpretation .
We must remember that if we follow this road .
It is in connection with Galileo , of all things , that everything is weighed in the balance a thousand times over , every euro is examined closely , whereas in other areas the European purse-strings strings are much looser .
This should remain something that the Members of this House should decide for themselves , because it is naturally also extremely important that we should explain the benefits effectively .
It is our duty not to compromise which it comes to the involvement of the European Parliament in the negotiations concerning the financial framework for the 2013 to 2020 budgets .
On the other , we have many parliamentarians from other countries - primarily from developing countries - who cannot meet the costs , even for travel and accommodation , in order to attend these debates and play a role in this decision-making making process .
I can only express my thanks for the support for our position .
I do not think we should operate a policy of divide and rule , dividing the future of the ACP into A , C and P. Just because they are the poorest countries they must be able to stand together opposite us and maintain a dialogue line representing the south .
We strongly protest against this procedure .
That is the basis of our political work .
However , the Commission will not be able to avoid giving serious consideration to harmonizing sanctions , because only deterrence provides protection against infringement , and only uniformity of sanctions can help to make the monitoring activities credible to the fishermen of the various Member States .
And this is precisely where I agree with the rapporteur when he says that not only the national benefit of transEuropean infrastructural projects for the individual Member States should be taken into account but also the net benefit to the Union as a whole .
We need legal consistency .
Problems do occur from time to time - there is no doubt about that - and we must , together with Hungary , work towards finding solutions to them , but , taken as a whole , water in Austria is of outstanding quality , as can be measured against the standards laid down by the European Union &quot; s Bathing Water Directive .
But we know that , in many parts of the world , such as the Middle East or Southern Asia , where the Kashmir conflict is a potential tinderbox , the international community is waiting for the European Union to be able to engage in mediation , so that there will be more shoulders to share the burden of responsibility in this domain .
The parameters for the exhaust values , and for the fuel values , must be met .
In addition to the self-appointed appointed occupying powers - the United States , United Kingdom and Poland - the ranks of the coalition of the willing also included such major military powers as Palau , the Marshall Islands , Micronesia and the Kingdom of Tonga .
I can imagine that the Members present will be particularly interested in hearing what the Commission has to say .
I have two comments on what Mr Sakellariou proposed .
We have also very clearly enshrined the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle here ; otherwise in the long term freedom of choice would not be guaranteed at all .
Everything else is less transparent than the Mafia .
We are being asked to approve this aid for the first time , and it is not entirely clear which other parts of the budget some of this money is supposed to come from .
We have to decide whether we wish to shape the future democratically or simply manage the consequences , and this applies not only to how our civil societies reflect on themselves collectively and actively as a European entity and part of the global village , but also to cultural production and services as a source of new and lasting employment .
Commissioner , your words struck a chord with me because I share your ideas about how we should proceed , namely that we should regulate this matter in a dedicated future revision of the EU data protection framework , while at the same time taking the opportunity to say that we also wish to regulate and promote the EU-US US Data Protection Framework Agreement because we see the need to regulate such data transfers in this global world .
In the directive on patenting biotechnological inventions , the cloning of human beings is prohibited as a whole , Commissioner Prodi , because it offends common decency and law and order - so it is not only the patent that is prohibited ; the technique is too .
This is not so much about big policies ; it is simply about us wanting to make our policies testable : what taxes are levied in this area , how much material are we using .
As I just said , Sir David Hannay &apos; s statements do not fall within the remit of the Council or the European Union , and therefore I cannot comment on them .
They constitute an abuse of the young people to whom promises of paradise are made , and they involve the murder of other innocent people .
However , when it comes to the relationship of the citizens to the State , the programme is a manifestation of an utterly badly erected framework .
If we cannot guarantee a competitive system , then will shall face the threat of corruption , excessive prices , unfair treatment of competitors and even bad investments .
As President Barroso once said , it is necessary when speaking with the USA to be at the same eye level .
, Mr President , my group welcomes this resolution , especially Recital I and paragraphs 8 to 13 , which take the broader view of the issue that Mr HorÃ¡Äek and I wanted to see .
Mr President , Commissioner , there have been many speeches this afternoon about the financing of EU agricultural policy .
However , the fact that we accept this strategy does not necessary mean that we accept all the detail .
The decision to make it easier and simpler to gain Latvian citizenship has clearly been taken with an eye to the future , and is all the more important when one thinks of the country &apos; s dark and tragic history , since the ethnic mix of its population is partly the result of decades of occupation .
The financial framework even of the TACIS programme is limited by comparison with what other international organizations are doing , and certain Member States of the European Union , such as the Federal Republic of Germany , have greater political influence in Russia than does the European Union as a governmental institution .
Regrettably , the Commission has not given us such answers so far , specifically as regards how we need to strengthen the producer organisations in order to give them more market power and restrain the supermarket chains .
Of course we must also make sure that Basel does not produce a second disadvantage for banks , as a result of higher own-funds funds requirements .
The two strategies should therefore be further developed and implemented in close coordination in content terms .
Mr President , I should first like to thank the rapporteur for his work and also for his efforts to reconcile diverse positions , about which we have heard today .
Why did our Spanish friends in the Committee on Fisheries welcome the new Amigos de la Pesca grouping with such jubilation ?
We are trusting partners in this dialogue .
It was very important to me that we should reinforce national ownership and political responsibility and that we should hold to account the ministers within whose remit the internal market and the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy fall .
Mr President , Madam President-in in-Office Office , I hope you will not take it amiss if I do not endorse your cautious optimism , because I find that rather difficult .
For example , one German region , while being much smaller than Sweden , has far more hospitals and hospital beds .
This subject is particularly problematic when it comes to foreign policy .
Naturally I have an interest .
We therefore propose a European industry council on the future of mobility involving politicians , businesses , trade unions and academics .
What are the crucial points in the Botz report ?
This Union of ours is a great thing , extending from Estonia to Portugal , and we have to ask ourselves what holds it together .
This has been deleted .
What products are meant by the reference to crustaceans ?
The EU has absolutely no powers to enforce such a ban .
Certainly not in reality !
The Commission asked on 17 November for an urgent priority according to article 97 .
This Charter will , I think , need to be supplemented in the future , if it is to become the foundation stone of a European constitution .
Turning to the port workers and the pilots , you have , in the course of the debate we have had - and Mr Jarzembowski knows this too - met some of our expectations , but not others .
Let us get back to our cattle . I see that the figures for these next year are bigger than those for this year , adding up to a policy precisely contrary to what we actually wanted - down with export refunds , especially where live animals are tormented in the way they were in the past , and where the Commission is not in a position to guarantee the correct implementation of what the directives contain on the subject .
Put quite simply , if we demand this of industry , we should be aware that 50 % of gross national income is generated by small and medium-sized sized enterprises .
I would ask you to condemn this unequivocally in the interests of all Members of this House .
I only hope that there is just as much awareness of the problems involved and willingness to resolve them , as the devil is well known to dwell in the details .
What can the EU do ? What should be retained and what changed in response to these challenges ?
But more transparency is not enough in itself if we want to come closer to the citizens .
It was the European Parliament that called on the governments to include Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia in the negotiations .
You should ensure that everything is in order before you go to Copenhagen .
I do believe , though , that the European Union had to consider the victims &quot; needs and could not have waited any longer to vote these funds once and for all and to make them available , for to do otherwise would have adversely affected its credibility .
That really is absurd .
I then learned from in London that it was given a slot in February .
Which of our considerations and demands ultimately end up in the action plan is , of course , purely up to the Commission , but the quality of the cooperation - for which I am very grateful - leads us to believe that , on the essential issues , we are thinking along the same lines .
But what does secession mean ?
Mr SjÃ¶stedt has , though , already addressed the importance of our finding a truly satisfactory solution to the issues of liability and labelling .
If we do not go down this path then we will undermine our future prosperity , our competitiveness , our economic productivity and the social cohesion of society .
When they leave that role , however , that understanding often crumbles away .
Basically I was very much in favour , but there were two points I could not accept .
I know that there are financial problems , but we urgently need diplomatic representations in the area .
Although the candidate countries have made evident efforts to transpose the acquis communautaire on equal treatment , substantial advances remain to be made , and so the Commission will continue to give the utmost attention to this topic .
It is the absolute truth .
( Applause ) We ask you most sincerely to exert your influence as President-in in-Office Office of the Council so that all governments send personalities to this Convention whose words carry weight in the national capitals and governments , so that what is decided in the Convention may also have something of a cohesive effect on the national governments in the countries of the European Union .
There is no denying the success of the Cohesion Fund .
Furthermore , they provide protection against arbitrary actions and the abuse of power .
In my opinion , the Commission &apos; s proposal should be viewed positively .
Of course I would have preferred to have mandatory targets , but we now have to do more work convincing people to give renewable energy sources a chance in the market on a voluntary basis .
Attacks on institutions , hostage-taking taking and all other kinds of violence do not just contradict our own values .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , protecting human health is also the primary objective when it comes to cosmetic products .
I am confident that the industry will act quickly . However , in our role as a European institution we must stay on the ball .
In this regard , I fully support Mrs Jeggle .
Anyone who is familiar with the situation in Poland , Romania or Spain will understand that coal has to be included as an option in the Energy Roadmap 2050 , otherwise they will be ignoring the realities of democratically elected parliaments and governments .
As the European Parliament , we should therefore be campaigning for the deployment of troops and for humanitarian aid , but we should also be making our contribution as quickly as possible to a sustainable political peace strategy for the region .
I should also like to add that financial support is likewise provided already for the development of the production of organically produced and fair-trade trade bananas in the ACP countries under the Regulation establishing a special framework of assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas .
We need more democracy , not less , because with this additional power comes the need for more democracy within Parliament .
In the last 50 years , trade throughout the world has increased by a factor of 17 , and has expanded by more than twice the level of macroeconomic production .
Allow me to cite an example : thank God , the awful proposal that Poland should have fewer votes than Spain , despite having the same population , was revised .
The use of new technology must be constantly perfected , especially through the creation of wider Internet access to encourage recourse to such new learning methods .
It is precisely in this area that the Code is weak , as it is not binding and makes no provision for sanctions against those who supply weapons to conflict regions all the same .
I am very grateful .
This could be readily monitored ; hence our appeal for improved monitoring , not only to the Commission , but especially also to the Member States .
In the EU &apos; s assessment , granting these trade preferences should only cause limited adverse effects on the Internal Market and should not affect negatively the least developed members of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) .
Because there are a whole lot of issues missing from the new transatlantic agenda that belong in any dialogue committed to the environment and the welfare of the people .
Oh yes , that is something we have long been calling for , but you have never paid any attention .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am afraid that I am not able to follow the rapporteur &apos; s recommendation to accept the common position , for the reason that certain minimum requirements which are all in the interest of the matter itself have not been fulfilled .
It promotes judicial cooperation and improved mutual understanding of legal systems , as well as measures to transpose and implement Community legislation in this area and better information for the public .
That may not tally with the clichÃ©d view but it is a fact .
It was simply a question of the wording of the text .
Questions Nos 54 to 58 will be answered in writing .
On the other hand , a European conference is planned for the Common Foreign and Security Policy , and for policy on internal affairs and justice , involving a meeting of heads of State and Government once a year .
As we heard , negotiations are taking place in Geneva at the present time with a view to converting this international recommendation into a formal agreement .
That testified to his awareness of what it means to be European .
Help us by giving preferential treatment to fair trade products in public invitations to tender , and breathe fresh life into Article 23 of the Cotonou Agreement , whereby fair trade in collaboration with ACP ( Africa , Caribbean and Pacific ) States is to be accorded important status and supported .
The question of the legal basis - about Article 37 or Article 280 , as proposed by us - is of course not just an academic one .
There are several reasons why a solution has not yet been reached .
In actual fact , however , the measures are instead directed at keeping tax competition within the Union in check .
The basic objectives of an EU-wide wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability .
This means that the entire House supports the Commission in matters of competition policy .
It is , then , absolutely right that the Council and Commissioner Frattini in particular should openly call for action to be taken to give the public the sense that there is such a thing as a single European migration policy with certain cornerstones that ensure that everything is kept under control .
Parliament should exercise a little restraint . In any case , my group will ask that we vote against this proposal tomorrow .
The phenomenon that is migration is as old as mankind itself .
Thanks to my colleague Mrs van Putten , I had the opportunity to talk to journalists , officials and others at the Amsterdam Summit , in the Central Bank and on the fringe of the negotiations .
On the issue of the internal market for energy : for us this is not an end in itself but something that we really need .
Now to the reason itself .
This is an unequivocal signal to voters in the euro area to give the all too numerous Red-Green Green governments their marching orders , if they ...
Some of the time , and in some areas , Europe is at high risk of a black-out out .
The list of names includes one Ogana Ifowodo .
Furthermore , it is my duty as Chairman of this Group to point out that we perceive a social imbalance in Europe .
Reform of this kind is long overdue .
So let there be restructuring of the budget !
This was possible only because of the amicable , unwavering cooperation between the rapporteurs .
This , of course , cannot be fully achieved unless it is an effective binding requirement for all parts of the rail network and unless steps are taken to ensure that international transport operations are not obstructed again by piecemeal measures .
We need this directive , and if we adopt it tomorrow , as I hope we do , by agreeing to the common position , we shall achieve a strengthening of Europe &apos; s attraction as a location for biotechnology , and as a result we shall be able to hold our ground far better in terms of the law of competition .
You are perhaps not aware of this , but extensive animal tests are needed , for example , in order to be able to verify this sort of claim .
We should also give some thought to a matter about which I would like to ask the Commissioner a question : should we not be talking about textile labelling ? Labelling must be discussed with the WTO .
This directive is a move towards ensuring that drivers do not become overtired .
Instead , let us nurture the inherent power of our economy to keep renewing itself .
The reason why some Members mistakenly thought that the proper text was available is that copies of the text were produced for a meeting of the group leaders yesterday morning , but by yesterday evening the distribution desk only had this version with the lines and crosses .
If , though , you add your support to the broad support that already exists for the 21 amendments , you will be giving innovative and creative SMEs room to move , that is to say , the space and opportunity to develop .
They all say that we want to achieve the objective of using disabled-accessible accessible buses in Europe .
Neither the contamination of the soil and of the water underground , nor the harm done to the health of the population are capable of being dealt with within the Ukrainian budget , and it is in a situation like this that , for reasons beyond my understanding , aid from the EU runs out .
Child sex tourism is a tragic and distressing fact of life and this problem has become worse and more serious in certain regions of the world over recent years .
That is a bit rich ! We can only make progress here if Parliament receives the information it has asked for - proper information , not fragments .
Mr President , with your permission , I should like first to make a comment on Parliament &apos; s order of business .
Dangerous goods are often transported in the vicinity of towns .
Otherwise , competition for so-called called hard interests will , in cases of doubt , always lead us into the difficulties that we are currently facing .
I really do appreciate the fact that Mr van Hulten made such personal efforts to find a good solution for this change to the Financial Regulation and thus to get this key component of the reform up and running .
Thank you very much , Mr President .
Is this the issue and are you making an issue out of it ?
The second proposal that we will be rejecting is that of setting inflation targets .
I am most grateful that you did , that you reminded us of one of the pioneers of Europe and of our group , because he stood for the Community method .
The settlements must be removed .
I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my hope that neither of the two parties to the present conflict in the Middle East will take any unilateral action this week which might make a return to the negotiating table nigh impossible in coming weeks .
Perhaps it is easier for us , and that is , if you like , an advantage of neglect .
Thank you for your statements , Mr LÃ³pez Garrido .
There are not very many of us in the Chamber .
We in Parliament are one step ahead of you and have said : no , we do not want there to be so much domestic air traffic in Europe and would prefer passengers to take cross-border border passenger train services . We therefore also want the rail market in passenger services to be opened up .
That is the background to this decision , but I readily admit that it is certainly regrettable from the point of view of a sensible development of agricultural policy .
For that reason , our appeal for the abolition of capital punishment is especially directed at them , but it is also addressed to the other nations of the world .
My group supports the report ; we take a slightly different view on the last point .
It is imperative that the courts deal with this matter since , casting our minds back to the case of Ignacio Lopez at Volkswagen , this sort of insider knowledge is actually tantamount to a criminal act when an individual gains employment in another area so soon afterwards .
Furthermore - my apologies Commission - if your document states that the utilisation of the EU budget for the stability mechanism represents an innovative use of the EU budget , I would say that , in principle , this represents a circumvention of Parliament .
We have therefore agreed , as we did for the electricity directive , to indirect targets , with the option of moving to mandatory targets at a later stage if the actual rate of increase falls significantly short of the target set .
On behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party , I should like to say that we approve of this Agreement .
I do so in the awareness that the peace process in the Middle East is not just a question of foreign policy and the European Union &apos; s association agreements , however important both aspects are , especially in the context of the Barcelona programme .
There is no comparison whatsoever .
The question of how to deal with Turkey has been left unresolved for too long .
This text has been submitted for you to take a stand on it .
This will lead to problems for indigenous people such as the Sami , for they have a different notion of rights : that of collective rights .
Social cohesion is an indispensable part of the Lisbon process .
We have completely overhauled our policy style and the way in which we prepare and review legislation .
What access do patients have to information , and not just information in relation to their rights , but also in relation to their medication ?
What are we doing in the Baltic ?
Obviously , there is no point in starting to negotiate structural assistance or agricultural aid programmes with new members once they have already joined .
This approach therefore requires the Member States - both the private and the public sector - to be heavily involved in terms of making cofinancing available and providing the necessary support for managing and monitoring the measures .
It is very difficult for Europe to establish a European law in this area .
AIDS and HIV were once the stuff of real-life life horror stories in the press .
With this in mind , we endorse the report and support you in your difficult task as Commissioner for tax .
I hope , Madam Vice-President President , that you will shortly put before us a revised version of the rules on the charges for road use and that we will make distinctions along ecological lines as well .
I regard this as increasing efficiency .
We hope , Commissioner Nielson , that the Commission will work just as quickly on this motion as Parliament has .
My second point , Commissioner , has to do with the implementation of IACS in Greece and , in future , in the candidate countries .
There is a somewhat different memory that I still have of the Kohl years , and then , too , Europe was not everything .
Our group supports the draft resolution of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy ; we helped to produce it and it reflects our own opinions .
On 21 May 1999 - on the basis of the new legal position and directly after the Treaty of Amsterdam had come into force - the European Commission fundamentally altered and revised its proposal on the basis of Parliament &apos; s decisions of 11 March 1999 .
You cannot believe that austerity alone will lead to growth if we do not at the same time offer alternatives .
This office became the focus for most of the Commission &quot; s work to fight against fraud and OLAF was given the task and the right to carry out investigations in any of the European institutions if fraud was suspected .
We really need to be careful , however , not to let ourselves be excluded .
Let us take the example of India , where child labour is prohibited .
On the one hand , the high level of traffic occurs , not in a flexible space , but rather in a fragmented European sky ; the Member States &quot; air traffic control systems are still often not mutually compatible .
Now the Council has submitted a draft with a figure EUR 10.3 billion below the ceiling .
Let us then call for sustainable protection of the environment , social standards and the punishment of human rights violations .
I have no sympathy for the Liberals &apos; proposal to postpone all these measures to strengthen Europol to provide more security in the interest of citizens until the Treaty comes into force .
Through the provision of funding , the EU is already actively supporting the work of the Committee on Missing Persons ( CMP ) at the exhumation sites , in the anthropological laboratories and with the families concerned .
Although we have now adopted the infrastructure costs directive , what is the Commission contemplating doing , particularly by way of studies and expert assessments , to more clearly elucidate the link between pollution of the environment and heavy goods traffic and , on that basis , to present a new and final proposal for an improved Eurovignette directive with less of an impact on the environment ?
In most countries whose regions have the power to pass legislation , those regions have such a right of action through the medium of a national chamber , and this is something that could , to a substantial extent , be taken up .
Of course , if agreements have been concluded , they must also be adhered to , especially as far as transport is concerned .
Education is not an end in itself but is the key to our being able to hold our own in the modern age , not just in economic terms but also at a personal level .
Congratulations to the rapporteur - we shall continue our cooperation .
It is with these things in mind that the debate on Turkish accession must be conducted .
I tried , back then , to obtain more scientific opinions from Germany and I have since received these .
In such situations , good advice soon becomes invaluable .
We have been able to resolve many trade conflicts in a professional way that satisfied both sides , but only because we have accepted binding rules for free and fair world trade within the framework of the WTO , and also because the WTO is the only international organisation that has a dispute resolution system that also provides for sanctions .
Indeed , that was why the General Affairs Council , back in November of last year , called on Iran to take steps to resume substantive discussions within the framework of the dialogue .
That again is no reason for urgency ; and there is even less reason for urgency when I quote you what the head of this Monitoring Centre says in an interview she authorised .
For the sake of the environment , and fishermen , we must aim to achieve sustainable management of fish resources .
Exactly which Member State is BSE-free free ?
This is why it is not really possible to bring the countries with such poor collection rates before a court , because they are acting correctly according to their own standards .
Be more courageous , and you will have Parliament on your side .
Madam President , like the previous speaker , I can only point out that yet again we have to draw attention to the atrocities - and how often have we already condemned such actions ? - which are being committed primarily in Colombia , which , one regrets to have to say , is a land of violence .
The Italian national railways have been neglecting both goods and passenger transport here for years .
In fact , as the past few years have shown , exchange-rate rate turbulence has a detrimental effect not only on economic growth , but also on employment .
We have adopted the draft directive on injunctions at the first reading as a preventive measure for the collective protection of consumers .
I am at a complete loss to understand why animals are now being expected to comply with human ethical standards .
It certainly also has the major problem that it has in one country different cultures , languages and ethnic groups , and it has not so far succeeded - I might add that it is not alone in this - in giving these diverse cultures and ethnic groups the space that will alone make it possible to maintain the country &quot; s political unity .
According to a report from the World Bank , these groups have at their disposal nowadays a sum of between 800 billion and 1 trillion dollars .
Why not give me credit for something in public ? &quot; Well , Mr President of the Commission , I am doing it now .
Unless domestic demand is strengthened , in other words unless people &apos; s purchasing power is increased , a sustained upturn will be impossible to achieve .
The same applies to power generation from waste gases in steel production .
I am pleased that the majority has been able to prevent measures that were intended to do away with social achievements such as , for example , the Working Time Directive , and the export of social benefits across borders .
Agreement with the Council at second reading is a success for the European Parliament .
This directive will also help us to overcome the crisis .
One option , to be sure , is greater integration of the supply network in the European Union , which would have the effect of simplifying the exchange of gas within the Community , thus reducing the dependency of individual Member States on certain states by which gas is supplied or through which it has to pass .
This creates areas of inequality , both between cross-border border commuters and between local authorities , and these can only be eliminated in the foreseeable future through coordination of all our tax systems on a European scale .
It would be a good thing for all of us if the Council could incorporate into this definition the meaning of &quot; developing countries &apos; , so as to prevent any wider interpretation here .
We must support the UN &apos; s initiatives .
I cannot accept Amendment No 9 as at present drafted , as no scientific evaluations have been submitted to us demanding a ban on fixed gillnets , but I will take up your suggestion in this regard and ask ICES for a scientific evaluation of whether and for which areas such a ban on fixed gillnets might be a sensible conservation measure .
Twenty years ago , the Single European Act set the internal market as a goal .
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has added several points in its opinion , including the reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , a definition of the party as having legal personality so that it can conduct legal transactions , and further-reaching reaching proposals on controls , including on revenue from donations .
I can tell you that I certainly did give an interview to the BBC , but the name Andreasen was not even mentioned in it .
I hope that many people will take part and say : there is no place for intolerance in the European Union .
Mr Patijn , thank you for that answer , which largely recapitulates the familiar timetable for the accession negotiations and the fact that those negotiations will start on the basis of equal entitlement .
Mr President , the fate of the Haug report on Thursday still rests in the lap of the gods , but nevertheless , many thanks for this great endeavour .
This recast directive , for the first time , provides standard definitions of such concepts as &apos; discrimination &quot; or &apos; sexual harassment &quot; .
We need clear and sound legal foundations for the European Union of the future , so that this whole structure can be held together .
Portuguese men and women are extremely well informed and have access to every possible source of information .
Should more be done in the field of agriculture ?
Recently my group held a conference on the Middle East , chaired by Pasqualina Napoletano , and our findings were similar to those of the ten foreign ministers who recently stated their position in an article .
The Council , the Commission and Parliament have been lamenting this situation for years , but little or nothing has as yet been done about it .
I believe it to be extraordinarily important that I should say , in this context , that the European Union can of course be extended to include more countries , and Bulgaria and Romania are waiting for this .
They have not done so .
Mrs Pack pointed out that the Committee on Culture has been waiting for months for our questions - just the questions - relating to applying coordination in the field of culture , education , youth , the media and sport to be dealt with here at all .
My group considers the Services Directive one of the greatest successes to date in terms of shaping the internal market .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I should like to start by thanking Mrs GrÃ¶ner for the work she has done on this report .
For a successful programme against human trafficking , we need to prioritise education , awareness-raising raising , and we will need money later on .
