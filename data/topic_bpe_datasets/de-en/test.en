I therefore call on all Members of this House to work with persistence towards the holding of referendums on the Constitution in every Member State of the European Union and , above all , for in @-@ depth depth dialogue with people on the future of the European Union .
That is very much the case .
I say this despite being a firm supporter of strengthening the internal market .
It would be convincing . Maybe we could look at it like that - I know it is an unfair comparison - and perhaps we would come to another judgment .
I also take the view that it is only this tension between the various committees that makes it possible for something sensible to emerge at the end of the day .
Of course , full provision is made for important structural support programmes in the budget planning process .
Mr President , I very much welcome the pro@@ spec@@ tu@@ s directive that is before us .
Madam President , I would be delighted if this were to be my last speech on this subject in this House , because we really must get this sorted out sooner or later !
There is therefore a legitimate fear that , as a result , drivers and companies will regularly be tempted not to comply with the statutory standards .
We have to ensure that transparency and clarity in matters concerning the European Budget are capable of being communicated to the public .
There were undoubtedly diverse conditions in the Member States .
So far - and here I fully agree with my fellow MEP , Mr Rapkay - this has not been satisfactorily resolved in any Member State .
We cannot have our hands tied and not be able to allocate aid where we consider it necessary to do so , on the basis of our analysis , for the purposes of structural policy .
in writing . - The dairy sector is currently in the midst of a crisis on an unprecedented scale : producer prices have fallen dramatically , consumer prices have risen and many farms in the EU are fighting for survival .
It has been a seriously bot@@ ched job on the part of the Commission .
I believe we should achieve this in time .
Madam President , some people have one minute worth and speak for two .
I really must thank the rapporteur both for her report and for taking this line .
The decision of March 2007 refers to projec@@ tions of energy consumption in 2020 , which were to be cut by 20 % .
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .
However , we must not leave Croatia out on its own .
The first is that it is right that it must be our aim to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock production , in particular .
Today , a fellow Member has quite rightly asked : What is the Commission doing ? What are the Member States doing ?
Despite all this , I would like to mention the positive things about Johannesburg .
The main theme of this report is that if we are looking at European ports as part of the trans @-@ European European network , then we need a policy which provides for ports relevant to Europe &amp; apos ; s needs to be incorporated into that network .
Madam President , an environmental policy involves pursuing aims .
This Charter is a visible expression of the fact that the European Union is concerned about protecting our citizens in respect of all acts emanating from the European Union .
There should be a regular exchange of views on the implementation of the Regulation .
Overall , I think we need a thorough rethink of the amendments .
Instead of giving their blessing to the current practice - which violates the human rights of &amp; apos ; illegally staying third @-@ country country nationals &amp; apos ; - at European level as well , the Member States should be looking for a lasting solution to the problem of migration .
Before being appointed , the candidates are to appear before the competent committee or committees of the European Parliament to make a statement and answer questions .
Therefore , we absolutely must take care to ensure that all corridors are indeed developed and to discover where there is a need for financing and where the EU should concentrate its efforts .
We hope they do not remain only as intentions but that what you have put before us will indeed become the opinion of the Fifteen and a basis for our further work .
This is a core issue for the future of this parliamentary democracy , which at the end of the day we all wish to achieve through the convention and through the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference .
Firstly , the European Union sets enhanced competitiveness in global markets as the goal of economic activity and hence also of restructuring , and that amounts to nothing other than an attempt to seek out and find the weak areas outside the EU , to which the losers can be transported .
In specific terms , this means that if the committee tables proposed amendments , for example to points 18 to 22 , and we in our group , and I assume that the procedure is the same in the other groups , are unable to discuss them before today and would like to take a separate vote on the various points , then we are stuck from a procedural point of view , i.e. we can no longer request a separate vote .
Let us join together in trans@@ forming all our challenges into opportunities , for the benefit of all ; then Europe will still be what it is today , a good place in which to live and a force for good in this one world of ours !
The sm@@ oul@@ dering Iraq crisis , along with America &amp; apos ; s continuing deployment of troops in this region and the divergent views on this emanating from London , Berlin and Paris , demand sensitive handling .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s biotechnology strategy sets the coexistence of various types of cultivation as an important priority .
Experience shows that this only leads to disputes between Member States and makes it more difficult to find a real solution .
But further progress in that direction is needed in Amsterdam , because we want and need this Intergovernmental Conference to be a success .
That is why I so much endorse what the report is now endeavouring to do : it is trying to approach China through dialogue , rather than prescri@@ bing from above in a kind of imperi@@ alist manner how China should conduct itself ; instead China is being invited to join with us in making the world a better , fairer and economically more successful place .
The country &amp; apos ; s political prisoners must be released .
It is an important question , and there is no harm in having differences of opinion .
on behalf of the S &amp; amp ; D Group . - Mr President , I do not share the opinion that the Commission &amp; apos ; s communication is a good one .
I should also like to mention the contribution by the Committee on Women &amp; apos ; s Rights and Equal Opportunities to the report .
This does not do justice to the dignity of Parliament and I object to a procedure of this kind .
What you say is indeed logical , and ide@@ ally standards would be applicable internationally .
Can we assume that we have you on our side in this , Commissioner ?
Through the clear position it has adopted - not least in our plenary discussions - the European Parliament has prevented big car companies from dict@@ ating prices , which would have been the consequence if we had agreed to this proposal .
We have voluntarily joined forces to examine issues that there is not enough time to deal with in committee , such as Tibet , the family and child protection , the Fourth World , the Baltic region or animal welfare . We are visible , we are audi@@ ble , and we are responsible for many of the initiatives that eman@@ ate from the European Parliament .
My special thanks go to Mr Bec@@ se@@ y , Mr Degutis , Mrs L@@ ich@@ ten@@ berger and Mr Koh@@ l@@ í@@ č@@ ek , to the Commission for its strong support and to our Secretariat , and particularly Mr Ver@@ v@@ lo@@ et .
If Russia is opening up its markets , we shall do so too .
The vote will take place this afternoon at 5.30 p.m .
This creation of a Euro @-@ Latin Latin American area has the potential not only to bring positive economic results but also , above all , to strengthen the role of the EU as a foreign @-@ policy policy player , particularly in respect of the United States .
Let me also add a few words on the current process . As far as the procedural provisions are concerned , I should have liked to see a different form of parliamentary involvement in this sensitive matter .
After all , 2009 is a crucial year for various reasons : it will see not only a new European Parliament , but also one or two institutional challenges , such as a new composition of the Commission .
Solidarity is what unites us .
Mr President , it is a pleasure for me to be able to catch your eye .
In this context , Commissioner , I should like to recall two points , in connection with which I asked questions and made requests during a debate on the same subject all of a year ago .
National parliaments lose the right to ratify international treaties without this House gaining that right .
The European Union can and must play a leading role in this .
The European Union is the main market for tim@@ ber and fish .
It will be clear by the time of the European Fo@@ ot@@ ball Ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on@@ ships in 2012 at the latest whether Ukraine has developed a common Ukrainian consciousness or whether it will continue to suffer from its linguistic and geograp@@ hic divide .
Why do we demand this ?
Our commitment as a Parliament to monetary dialogue with the European Central Bank was particularly important .
That is not an abstract plea .
This is now intended to be tightened up and strengthened with better sanction mechanisms .
As you can see , this is a very ambitious undertaking , and it is very important for the European Union .
On one point , however , I tend to support the line taken by the Commission .
Irrespective of how we view the problem , it is worthwhile pointing out that these damage limitation measures could never have taken place on this scale without the involvement of the European Union .
Regarding the amendments adopted in the committee , the Commission can accept the following amendments : Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 ( first sentence ) , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 ( in part ) , 18 , 19 , 20 and 21 ( in part ) .
These are the main parties involved ; they must be the ones to drive innovation in Europe , and we placed them in the fore@@ ground by removing many sometimes obviously bureaucratic obstruc@@ tions , for instance through a new V@@ a@@ dem@@ ec@@ um .
Do@@ ing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen .
We look forward to your next visit .
That is why we have come up with a significant simplification of EU legislation .
I believe the draft brings us another step closer to a genuine single market .
I can assure you that the Commission will closely monitor the progress of the investigations .
There is still insufficient interest in mutual understanding between these two regions of the world , although economic and trade policy , and a shared interest in a security partnership , do exist .
The answer is a clear &amp; apos ; no &amp; quot ; .
That is why the European Union must carry out a much wider @-@ scale scale preventive environmental policy than before in order to prevent such disasters in future .
We should not be sacrific@@ ing the airlines , and the European airports too because of the trans@@ location effect , to a one @-@ sided sided environment policy .
This might present an opportunity to do this at this level , and it is enormously important that the Ombudsman has offered to develop joint activities with local and regional ombu@@ ds@@ men and with committees on petitions .
That decision will have to be respected !
Mr President , Mr Blak , thank you very much for your kind welcome .
Mr President , like the previous speakers , I would also like to thank the rapporteur , Mr K@@ iri@@ lo@@ v , for his good work and for the high quality of the report , which is extremely comprehensive .
However , even the traditional human rights are not yet firmly enshrined in the law of the European Union .
Before the vote I pointed out that I insisted that there should be a vote on the second part , which does not include Mr Crowley &amp; apos ; s amendment .
All I wished to say was that I have voted in favour , because I am keen to see these countries &amp; apos ; early accession to the Union .
These elections may represent the beginning of a possible and necessary democratization .
I should like to conclude , however , by mentioning one more aspect that is particularly important to us as Parliament : only when we succeed in creating a uniform framework within the EU will we gain the trust of our citizens in respect of transatlantic data protection .
I asked the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control to draft a letter to that effect .
It is still true that a single currency without a single fiscal economic policy is , and will continue to be , a risky undertaking .
There are those in this Parliament who oppose the Constitution .
In so doing , we were providing a situation in which - as Mr Poettering just said - we are working together step by step towards a Palestinian state , by giving Mr Abbas his due , namely the future leadership of a state , representing his country in the region as an equal partner on the basis of full sovereignty .
The problem is , I think , that competition between ports has to be organised .
The Commission proposes to submit the new Structural Fund orders next year around E@@ aster , and all further decisions then depend on the decisions of the Council , not just about the financial prospects , but also about the Structural Fund order .
Mr President , please forgive me for commenting on the order of business at the start of this debate .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my opinion on three areas of Mrs Bal@@ zani &amp; apos ; s report .
I say &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; to clear and transparent rules , but &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; to over@@ regulation which makes this working relationship more difficult and bureaucratic .
Madam President , I respect your thinking , but I believe it to be wrong .
This is very nice , but we have been waiting for years for the Commission to take action and to make some genuine progress in this area .
The importance of a common statute means that a solution must be sought together with the Council and without pressure of time .
Of course , we have to bear in mind the constra@@ ined position in category 5 , that is , the area of administrative expenditure .
And that applies not just to economic and employment policy ; it also applies to social and environmental policy .
In the European Union , consumers attach ever greater importance to the use of them .
It is an excellent report , and we do not have too many excellent reports .
I know that one of your own priorities is to integrate the developing countries in international trade .
Thirdly , if an employer negle@@ cts to fully and effectively inform and consult employee representatives in good time before publicly announcing such steps , then that can in no way be justified .
I can say that each successive agreement has seen this House &amp; quot ; s role as a &amp; apos ; Chamber of Citizens &amp; quot ; and hence as a body monitoring the European executive progressively reinforced .
We also need to focus on employment in the Member States .
As long as the European Union refuses to admit that it cannot accommodate all economic migrants from every conceivable quarter , hundreds of thousands more will make their way here .
We wish you success in making clear , tomorrow , our desire for a strong Europe in one world , by which I mean that we may not deta@@ ch Europe from the world ; on the contrary , this Europe of ours must help respond to the great problems of the world .
That is my question to the propos@@ er of the motion .
The association agreements with Chile and also of course with Mercosur are valued highly by the European Union .
Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , you spoke about transparency , about being close to the citizens , about dialogue , the spear@@ heading role of parliaments and broad public debate and you meant , you believed , that you were talking about democracy .
What is needed , please , is a gradual opening and a cautious approach .
You can safely assume that part of our strategy will be to take measures to strengthen Europe &amp; apos ; s position .
Since working people spend a very great deal of time at their workplace and are exposed to stress in connection with their work , it is necessary to promote mental health in that particular setting .
That is important in terms of the climate issue .
It constitutes another aspect of the debate .
Thirdly , the question at issue for me is not merely cross @-@ border border trade between Austria and Germany , although that is the starting point ; it is the question of the role of language areas and the role of cultural areas .
We considered referring this matter back to committee out of pure anno@@ y@@ ance , because , once again , we have been overlooked and our expert work is being ignored .
That is the starting point .
We have done what we can to use our political influence to make the Government of the Slovak Republic aware of the urgency of this matter and to ask it to carry out a thorough investigation .
Can he tell us how he sees the progress that has been made on this TEN project , since this project is so vital to the EU ?
This alone is very detrimental for Europe &amp; apos ; s future industry , the mobile radio communications sector .
Without indul@@ ging in any illusions , I believe that is important , it has to happen .
In view of this , I ask you to adopt the two amendments in the name of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , tabled by Mr Oostlander and myself .
I should therefore like to ask that the time until mid@@ day on Wednesday be used for further discussions on a compromise .
In political terms , of course , it is a matter of some significance whether the chair@@ persons of the joint parliamentary committees and of the interparliamentary delegations are appointed en bloc by this , albeit rather th@@ inned @-@ out out , House or whether every single candidate in every single joint parliamentary committee or every single interparliamentary delegation has to be elected or appointed as an individual .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s responses to the many requests made of it by members of the public or those running projects in the European Union are often uns@@ ym@@ pa@@ thetic or even bra@@ sh , and that is quite simply not on .
Mr President , I am merely trying to clarify - and this does not have to be done now , it can be done later - whether the amendment was tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members or by the rapporteur .
Last week , Commissioner Fischler told the Committee on Fisheries that the European Union &amp; apos ; s fishing vessels are about 40 % over capacity , a figure that is not only alarming but also underlines all the more the urgent need for something to be done about this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the new College , ladies and gentlemen here in plenary and in the gallery , in these times of economic , financial and climate crisis , the citizens of Europe expect leadership from you .
In such a case , in fact , two Member States are probably committing infringements of the Treaty .
We cannot do without this Charter of Fundamental Rights if we are to construct a European democracy in this supranational area .
Let us take a look into the future .
I believe it is vital to develop the European Union &amp; apos ; s transport system , particularly in view of enlargement and the ever@@ increasing significance of environmental issues .
This issue calls for new law .
If the European Union wishes to assume the global role described by the Commission President , among others , in the matters of energy security or the Gaza conflict , it cannot allow itself to dis@@ integrate ; we need the Union of 27 as a strong economic and political bloc .
I would ask you , Mr Prodi , to lend your support to the idea that this body in Dublin should be able to visit the Member States without warning , that it should have investigative powers and that it should be able to carry out its task of over@@ seeing the relevant supervisory arrangements in the Member States .
Madam President , what I have to say relates to the forthcoming vote . The point is that something has once again happened this time which I already complained about months ago : the joint motions for resolutions are indeed available in all the language versions , but the original texts are not .
Over the next 20 years we shall not obtain any genuine harmonised targets in Europe .
The aim would be to set an example for peace and stability in our continent and for greater integration , and this would be a viable way of doing so .
What opportunity did we actually have to present that ?
I believe we are in agreement that we need a positive list of what feed is actually permitted to contain .
Com@@ par@@ ing that with the situation in similar debates as recently as five years ago , we see that there is today in this House very broad consensus on the need for a European defence contribution .
In the field of company taxation , we need to agree on definitions and bases for calcul@@ ating tax .
The principle of reciprocity must be respected , because that is the only way to achieve a balanced outcome of the negotiations .
I agree with Mr Juncker , the Prime Minister of Luxembourg , that the proposals relating to the presidency of the specialised Councils of Ministers are unclear , in other words , that they still need some clar@@ ific@@ atory amendments .
I would appreciate it if these points were not forgotten in the course of the imp@@ as@@ sion@@ ed debate to come .
For domestic reasons , as you know , the Slovakian Parliament decided yesterday to postpone its vote until a later date .
- It is certainly correct that the fundamental problem should be dealt with .
We have long known that we will make much more headway in the medium term with CO2 -@@ free renewable energy technology than with nuclear technology .
I am very grateful to Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra Neyra for taking this initiative on behalf of our group , and also to Mr D@@ ess , who is particularly concerned with relations with Latin America - in his case mainly Brazil .
I would also like to express my gratitude to Mrs De Keyser and her team and also to our parliamentary delegation , led by Mr Mc@@ Mil@@ lan @-@ Scott Scott , for their work .
It is not about endo@@ wing the fund with more money .
It is now absolutely imperative for us to address the issue of the borders of the European Union - and I do not just mean its geographical borders .
This is just one of the many improvements proposed .
I would like to state explicitly that this is an intolerable situation .
The Committee on Budgets , in common with all Members of this House , is very much in agreement with the objectives described in the Commission communication on the communication strategy covering the final stages of the completion of EMU .
Mr President , it was at the beginning of October that the 28 @-@ year year old mon@@ k N@@ ga@@ w@@ ang Jan@@ g@@ ch@@ ub died in his cell in the Dre@@ p@@ ung mon@@ ast@@ ery .
I am an ar@@ dent advocate of this sort of harmonisation , although I know that many of my fellow members take a different tack , believing that tax policy should be subject to competition .
Let me again express my heartfelt gratitude and my hope that this may bring us an agreed outcome in Parliament too .
We have to ensure that what has been announced and promised is actually kept to , and that we actually do whatever we can to help support the regions .
There is a continued need for an active support policy in rural areas aimed at offering women better prospects and better work opportunities .
Is this something that the Commission might also consider ?
If EU citizens co@@ determine the European legislative process and wish to introduce a Citizens &amp; apos ; Initiative , fairness essentially requires that the competent EU bodies state as soon as possible and in a binding manner whether the planned initiative fulfils the legal requirements of the Treaty .
Mr President , Vice @-@ President President Frattini , Mrs Ha@@ z@@ an , honourable Members of the European Parliament , firstly , let me thank you warmly on behalf of the presidency for this report on the evaluation of the European Arrest Warrant , which I have read with great interest .
Does the United Kingdom actually decide everything in Europe ?
A whole range of proposals made by Parliament have been taken up in the Common Position and in the Commission proposal , and there is a certain amount that we have achieved .
Madam President , if we assume that most jobs across Europe - not just in my country , Austria - are at risk due to the effects of globalisation , then we must consider , in particular , that younger workers - some of whom have not yet been registered as unemployed because they have just come from a training course or from school - are at risk as a result .
I am delighted with the turn which this debate has taken so far ; it shows me that we can count on a great deal of support from Parliament for principles which inform the way in which the negotiations are handled and for our resolve to start tackling outstanding problems quickly and resolutely .
I believe that some rethinking will certainly have to be done between the Council and Parliament on the liability limit for classification societies , irrespective of what is decided today .
However , the burden with which particularly Macedonia ( FYROM ) and to some extent Albania have to cope should not be disproportionate .
What has been reported by the Members of this House who were in Johannesburg , and also his conduct here today , make me wonder whether it makes any sense to let a Parliamentary delegation take part in such summits in this way .
This also involves our protecting their rights as employees and their rights in the workplace .
Mr President , it is precisely because I am concerned with internal affairs policy that I observe that the European Data Protection Supervisor plays a most important role in the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice .
At the same time , however , I regret the fact that my amendment , which would have made this an obligation , was not included in the final resolution .
Are we , with our exporters , contributing to food shortages because agriculture in the affected regions of this world cannot develop sufficiently on its own ?
It is not the people , not the West , but those in power in the government .
The Lisbon Council resolved unanimously to make Europe , by 2010 , the most competitive and knowledge @-@ based based continent , a continent fostering social cohesion , promoting sustainability and creating new jobs .
While this does not concur with my own view in this particular case - which is quite an unusual turn of events - I nevertheless consider it legitimate that this opinion should be expressed .
That we should hear this from the mouth of the President of the Commission is for us a cause for satisfaction , at least for the moment .
However , the Transport Council has demanded it , Parliament will demand it and , if my understanding is correct , we have a joint motion for a resolution tabled for tomorrow morning by many groups .
Madam President , the European Union has always endeavoured to achieve global cooperation on climate protection .
I was particularly concerned to keep to the timetable for the vote here in plenary so that the Council and Commission can have a dossier available before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency .
When it comes to energy and innovation , the EIB is helping the EU to implement its policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for trying to bring together various elements of European energy policy .
Services of general interest are compatible with competition , and , should the public interest so require it , the Member States will also be able to decide on derogations from the law on competition .
It seems to me particularly crucial to include the Internet in any discussions on the enforcement of intellectual property rights , because it is impossible to protect intellectual property on the Internet without cross @-@ border border agreements .
Mr President , we are beginning to establish a common asylum and immigration law in Europe .
If we could manage to remove only a fra@@ ction of the trade barriers on the transatlantic market , we could do much more for our citizens and , of course , for employees than has been achieved by many of the other measures that we have put far more effort into over the last five years .
I also find it good , given the worrying inf@@ la@@ tionary trends in many Member States , to reiterate that all necessary steps must be taken so that the inflation rate can be kept below 2 % in the second half of 2001 .
Parliament was therefore stating quite categorically that if certain things were not done , the subsequent appointment of judges to the Constitutional Court would be changed in such a way that this would only be undertaken in accordance with the political s@@ enti@@ ment of the ruling Party .
I believe it is a good thing that the Commission is holding firm here .
The Commission is also required to carry out a huge amount of work in connection with negotiations held within the framework of regional fisheries organisations .
It must balance traditional , liberal rights with an adequate set of economic rights as well as offer effective solutions to issues pertaining to the social rights of citizens of the European Union and to the need to guarantee them a basic standard of social protection ..
It is important from that point of view that Parliament have an associated debate to th@@ ra@@ sh out enlargement as a whole - the progress of the accession negotiations , financial issues and , last but not least , Community action for the border regions .
The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated .
Only now , when it is about to happen , has it made the European media head@@ lines and become a number one issue for the European public .
Finally , all this involves us looking into the future ; we are taking decisions on behalf of future Members , and I do not find that exactly proper either .
Mr President , what interests me most is how the euro @-@ debate debate will go on from here , after the referendum in Denmark , and what changes the Commission intends to make to the information strategy ?
A fundamental reform , not just an adjustment to this or that institution !
The situation is in fact quite paradoxical .
What is important as far as the practical implementation is concerned , is that both the EU Commission and the Member States have the political will in this particular instance not only to identify violations of human rights and hence of a fundamental part of the treaty , but also to apply the legal consequences provided for , which generally start with consultation and may lead to the suspension of parts or even the can@@ cel@@ lation of the entire treaty .
With this resolution , we are ready to take responsibility for European agriculture .
I consider it wholly inappropriate to bring this debate into the European Parliament , and I reject this most emphatically .
How much importance does the Council assign to the principles of partnership in the Structural Fund regulation , especially the participation of the environmental partners , the participation of the environmental NGOs , the participation of representatives of equal opportunities for women and of the social partners ?
From my point of view , they have come as close to Parliament &amp; apos ; s positions as they could - going further than I have seen before and further than I expected them to go .
Mr President , in connection with the European Police College , I would point out that what is particularly important is to combat crime in the cities .
On one point , however , the Council seems to have forgotten this in its discussions .
We , the European Parliament , which today represents 3@@ 70 million people must be the advocate of the peoples of the whole of Europe .
in writing . - Energy efficiency is an area with great potential for the future where the EU already has some experience . In addition , the EU Member States are home to many leading technology companies .
Five : although we totally condemn the PKK &amp; apos ; s acts of terrorism , Turkey itself must take steps to find political solutions to the Kurdish problems .
Combating discrimination of all kinds and bringing about participation in public life by the disabled are important jobs .
We are not able , either as the EU or as individual Member States , to create jobs , but we can help people who have lost their jobs to find work again as quickly as possible .
Romania has signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Hague Convention on Protection of Children .
I am of a different opinion .
But if we are not even enforcing the existing rules , how are we going to cope with even stricter ones ?
Madam President , basically this is a welcome report because it clearly and plainly shows up the super@@ ficial and in@@ substantial nature of the Commission &amp; apos ; s reports , or rather of the two reports .
The Commission intends to see to it that technical assistance is provided in D@@ il@@ i , with a view to ensuring effective implementation of the programmes .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by expressly welcoming Mr Ferber &amp; apos ; s report in its broadest outlines .
That is not the way .
But surely it would be a good thing , and reflect a genuine European vision , if as many young people as possible could receive part of their education in a neighbouring country .
Transparency is itself indispensable if quality is to be maintained and if the resources available to the healthcare systems are to be used in the best possible way .
In particular , the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand .
How are we to be credible in defending European values if we deny those seeking protection access to legal processes ?
In order to do that , we need money , and so we must increase funding .
Mr President , of all Europe &amp; quot ; s energy sources , energy efficiency is the most important , and the fa@@ stest and cheap@@ est way to achieve our Kyoto targets ; not only that , but it also gives us a chance to invest in Europe and create jobs , rather than handing over money to foreign countries or to the Arab world in return for oil and gas .
I believe this is a necessary basis for a new , fair and collabor@@ ative common fisheries policy which has sufficient resources - and that is an important point - and which reconci@@ les the economic neces@@ sities and the sustainability of the sector in the interests of all : the fishing community , consumers and citizens .
It is therefore hard for a fruitful coexistence to flourish .
But it is also important for justice and home affairs policy .
Similarly , it cannot be the duty of this Parliament to accept that the Member States want to re@@ organise their budgets to the detriment of the European Union budget .
We know , for example , that various double taxation procedures are causing enormous problems in the European Union .
Everything possible must be done , therefore , even by the European Union .
I also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility .
But this debate is in fact already out of date , overtaken by reality .
I am more inclined to take the opposite view .
The European Union has committed itself to something different , a different kind of burden sharing .
We must not forget , however , that cooperation between Asia and Europe does not only mean cooperation at governmental and parliamentary level . It also involves NGOs and the young people and women of Asia and Europe .
Mr President , a long @-@ standing standing dream of this Parliament , and one shared by many of Europe &amp; quot ; s citizens , is becoming reality .
We then need to develop the coordination mechanisms that are essential to enable us to take effective action .
Industrial policy will help us , firstly , to create good quality , future @-@ proof proof jobs in Europe and , secondly , to secure investment in Europe .
I would not like to repeat what my fellow Members have already addressed , but instead list a few points concerning the Committee on International Trade and particularly the responsibility of European importers to introduce border checks and the need to initiate legal product recall campaigns and the issue of when to resort to import bans and import restrictions as a whole and under what conditions .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s attitude and Mr van der Wa@@ al &amp; apos ; s work on this issue were very encouraging , but we have been very disappointed at the Council &amp; apos ; s refusal to adopt so many of our amendments .
We should not allow ourselves to be pressur@@ ised by the USA .
The fishing industry also means safeguarding people &amp; apos ; s economic and social living conditions .
This we regard as a matter to be resolved at the national level , and believe that the European Union should not concern itself with matters over which it has no power and for which it has no responsibility .
I regret this , and in the future we need to find a means of cooperating with the Council of Ministers to ensure that the Council is represented here in the European Parliament - and this is not to criticise the Swedish Presidency - throughout the week that we are in session .
This is the solidarity which we now need internally , so that this freedom can be achieved together with social justice .
That will enable the Seventh Research Framework Programme to concentrate properly on excellence in research .
Could the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office envisage , as part of a solution to the Kosovo issue , endeavours towards a bilateral settlement - so that borders do not have to be changed , because of course we do not want to change any borders - which gives the Albanians in Serbia the same rights as the Serbi@@ ans in Kosovo ?
All the requirements are contained in this report , because we need an integrated supervision structure to enable us to overcome the new challenges .
The aim of this agreement must be to achieve fair and equitable trading conditions to our mutual advantage and our mutual benefit .
However , after Mr Tab@@ aj@@ di made an oral statement on paragraph 41 I finally voted in favour .
We all stand up for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
The reform of income aid will , however , link direct grants to the role played by the farmer as a man@@ ager responsible for his land and for the rural environment .
The necessary response , then , is not to do as in the past and make promises , but to make more competition possible , and the fact that the Commission is at last doing something about this gives cause for hope .
On the definition of European parties , allow me to say quite clearly that European parties in no way have to to@@ e a particular European political line , but the values of democracy , the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights must be respected .
The Commission should monitor the agency and we should monitor the Commission .
I support it in principle , Mr Rübig , because you are defending the safety of our colleagues in this Parliament .
It is precisely here that there should be no cut in the Commission and the Council &amp; apos ; s contributions , because that would almost certainly be counterproductive .
It is worth considering the fact that the role of the EU Secretary for foreign affairs , which is viewed positively in the paper , will of course appear in a very different , and rather negative , light in this institutional context .
In particular , there is a need , in this context , to scrutinise EU subsidies with regard to how the transport of foodstuffs cris@@ s @-@ crossing crossing the Union can be reduced .
However , the question of when and how - the timing of accession and the conditions on which it takes place - remain open .
It is important to make this clear .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I can only agree with the rapporteur .
The European Union has already achieved a great deal in this respect , but it needs to do even more .
What we would like to see , at the European Council &amp; quot ; s Spring Summit , is a political agreement founded upon the outcome of this House &amp; quot ; s vote .
The Commission will have the right of initiative for this .
In both cases , we want to make it very clear that these bans would be completely unacceptable to us and would constitute major impe@@ di@@ ments to Turkey &amp; apos ; s progress towards becoming a member of the European Union .
I do not think it is the task of the European Parliament to go along with that .
This gives us a slight increase in this area , because , according to the resolutions adopted so far , for example , a premi@@ um of EUR 21 per head per ann@@ um is paid for sheep .
Whatever happens , we ought to have it before the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s first reading , as otherwise we will be at the mercy of the Council when it comes to making additional appropriations available in Category 5 , because if the letter is not submitted until after Parliament &amp; apos ; s first reading , an amendment will only be permissible if both parts of the budget authority , that is the Council and the Parliament , agree to it .
A world without nuclear weapons and even without dict@@ atorial regimes will remain an illusion while some states are only taken seriously when they join the ranks of the potential or actual nuclear powers .
Firstly the matter of constitu@@ encies . It is right that these should be limited to the larger countries and it should be made quite clear that the principle of proportional representation should not be affected by this in any way .
Mr President , as I said last time : before the courts and on the high seas , we are in God &amp; apos ; s hands , but at least the Erika I and Erika II packages will help to make the high seas a little safer .
In other words , not only has the process of democratic reform in that country been halted but so too have the char@@ itable aid measures on which the country &amp; apos ; s survival depends , because the Government has no money and is even curtailing its own measures of assistance .
This is also a task that we will entr@@ ust to our committees when we say to them : when you outline policies and liter@@ ally follow our every move in the course of the budgetary procedure and say we need another EUR 100@@ ,@@ 000 there , for example , then would you please continue to follow matters up when it comes to implementation .
It should be made clear to all countries that accession to the European Union is not quite the same thing as accession to the Economic and Monetary Union and to the euro zone , and that there are different deadlines .
I hope that this will change in future .
I am therefore thankful that , after the difficulties during the start @-@ up up phase of our new service , the External Action Service and the Commission are clearly now making progress and coming up with sensible proposals .
However when it comes to agriculture , it is only when health policy and public health are under discussion that Parliament has codecision rights , as per Article 152 , for the core area remains outside the codecision procedure .
I think we really have to stress the fact that enlarging by adding ten new Member States is no tri@@ f@@ ling matter , and the public expect the European institutions to apply the law even @-@ han@@ dedly han@@ dedly from the word go .
We have made it clear in our oral amendment that , in addition to the minimum wage , consideration should also be given to collective agreements and generally binding regulations , or a state @-@ guaranteed guaranteed minimum income .
At the same time , however , we also have to say that it is our job , in the European Union , to warn consumers when there is a dangerous food@@ stuff on the market .
This murder must be thoroughly investigated and the perpetr@@ ator and the people behind him must be brought to justice .
And that is what happened in the past .
Mr President , I shall be brief , because almost everything has been said already , while I was waiting my turn .
We need to pass on the message to the various banks in the Member States that this makes it easier to make investments , that small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises can be expanded , and that the European Investment Bank provides support for this .
The Commission attaches great importance to the ongoing reforms of public administration and the judiciary in both countries .
I do hope , of course , that the report will provide evidence that the recommendation has borne fruit , that our environmental legislation has become more effective , that the situation has improved .
Mr President , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is grateful for the opportunity to discuss these important issues with the European Parliament today , and I am very grateful for Mrs Frassoni &amp; apos ; s report and contribution , which contains valuable points .
The compromise solution which has now been adopted is so well thought out that with one exception , namely the small country of Luxembourg , all Member States have agreed to it .
A further important topic in this six @-@ month month period is European security and defence policy .
It is planned that a special report on the role of the regions should be introduced , but I do think that our long debate might also have the result that , tomorrow morning , we get together and reconsider whether what we have just said might yet , in rather more definite form - on which point various groups have submitted amendments - be incorporated into the report .
Secondly , criminal prosecution in this field is still in its in@@ fan@@ cy even though the state of affairs is disastrous .
What I do want , and what we demand in this resolution , which is a very balanced one , is for Russia to take the protection of these human rights defenders seriously .
Mr President , Mrs Peijs , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission &amp; apos ; s communication on the development of short sea shipping in Europe and the very good report on it by Mrs Peijs give a realistic picture of the development of this environmentally @-@ friendly friendly mode of transport in Europe over the past two years .
This House calls on the EU to pay attention to credibility on human rights issues when ratifying agreements .
Information and activities will be linked up by this agency rather than bureauc@@ rati@@ sed , and I believe that anyone working in this field will be aware of the urgent need for a European network of networks , as mentioned by the rapporteur .
We must not do this .
If it should not be successful , it will be difficult to start again on the path left for the compromise , that is , to complete a successful WTO panel procedure .
The work will therefore continue .
This would also include investment in modernising energy supply systems .
I should like to address another two parts of the supplementary budget .
A sensible approach would be national - or in Germany regional - cofinancing for correspon@@ dingly high compensatory payments .
The financial framework for the enlarged Union must be negotiated in such a way that an ambitious approach to the shaping of European policy is not obstructed by budgetary constraints at national level .
The EU is equipped with the legal and financial competences through its cohesion policy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are taking this oral question as the basis to discuss the progress made on cooperation in the areas of justice and home affairs during this past six months .
As this spec@@ tre of sec@@ ession hung over the room - and some in this Europe wish to support it - you held your nerve , stood up and said that countries needed to put their cards on the table .
It has our full support .
It is precisely what the Copenhagen criteria require .
What is the Commission doing in this regard ?
The greatest sensitivity is in the fact that I know a number of Member States which will not accept enlargement unless there is total clarity in this matter .
Let me say first of all that the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House naturally condemns every violation of human rights unequivocally , including those in China , of which there is no shortage .
If we do not recognise the rights of Parliament , who then in the general public will recognise us , take us seriously and vote on 7 June if this is what we do with the most powerful right that Parliament has ?
I have taken these concerns very seriously , because no one wants to stand in the way of innovation in Europe or impose additional burdens , especially on the small and medium @-@ sized sized IT companies .
We on the European side need to think , however , where we can actually contribute this much vaunted European added value , where we can do something from Europe that will help our citizens to live longer healthy lives .
Let us work on the basis of the next two @-@ and and @-@ a a @-@ half half years to start with , because that is a long time .
We still know too little about whether potential users are willing or able to pay .
I am therefore critical of the proposal to arrange our own trade visits .
Mr President , since I made a critical remark about the statements made by Prime Minister José Mar@@ ía Aznar , I should like to thank the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , who is represented here , for having explained - at least to me - that it is incumbent upon Parliament to send our political representatives to the interinstitutional working party .
We must also build up Europol , which would be much more effective if these difficult financial negotiations did not have to be conducted between the Member States of the European Union whenever we want to give it money .
It appeared to me that , on the whole , our views on this debate coincide fully with regard both to what we want and how we will achieve it .
It is not acceptable !
Then we would be getting somewhere .
Mr President , Commissioner , there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st C@@ ent@@ ury .
It is therefore quite clear that the policy must change , and of course that the developing countries must also implement changes that will benefit regional structures .
We must direct our endeavours towards making clear to both Israel and Hamas that we oppose any form of violent hosti@@ lities and demand absolute respect for peacekeeping forces and aid agencies .
We would now welcome a reply to our oral question from Commissioner Kroes , who has already had the opportunity to discuss this issue with us in committee , on behalf of the Commission .
Mr President , I would just like to contribute a few words to this discussion , which might help make the peace here .
Con@@ soli@@ dating the public budget is the main priority for every government in order to create the required scope for action .
For a European democracy , a constitutional process is needed ; for a peaceful order in Europe , courage is needed to accept responsibility for our own security ; and for the vision of Europe as a single social and ecological area it will be necessary for politics to be emancip@@ ated from an ever more aggressive neo @-@ liberal liberal ideology .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , if that was not on behalf of the group , I move ad@@ journ@@ ment on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance .
However , this is obviously not the only problem area . It is true that we cannot resolve all the difficulties overnight and that this process will remain an ongoing issue in future , as Mr Le@@ chner , the rapporteur , has said .
I have some general comments on this subject .
If we look at it like that , it is important that renewed efforts are made .
We have always supported the idea of a single European currency .
Mr President , I only wanted to ask you to update us on efforts within the Commission to incorporate the European Patent Office gradually into the structure of the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first , I should like to thank Mrs Kl@@ amt for this comprehensive and thorough report . I am glad , too , that the opinion of the Committee on Women &amp; apos ; s Rights has been incorporated into the report .
But we can at least fund what we think is the most important task , i.e. the democratisation and reconstruction of the western Balkans , from a total of EUR 8@@ 39 million , including EUR 2@@ 40 million for Serbia .
And , above all , the internal market is a first @-@ rate rate programme for making European businesses fit for global competition .
The new &amp; quot ; Youth &amp; quot ; action programme is the way to further European integration .
We want to make it easier for young people to work together as members of society while also offering them the opportunity to cooperate at European level , thereby , among other things , overcoming vo@@ ter ap@@ a@@ thy and awak@@ ening in them an interest in politics .
I hope that we will be able to find a suitable solution to the problem that still hangs over this issue .
The reason is that the police and the judiciary are still mainly the province of the nation states .
I do not see any contradiction here .
This is why it is the larger countries that have to understand the fact - of which this crisis is for this reason a helpful demonstration - that the self @-@ interest interest of a country &amp; apos ; s own citizens can be made to prevail only if we find something where all the European states &amp; apos ; interests conver@@ ge and , together , use that to carry some weight .
I believe it ex@@ hi@@ bits important weaknesses .
This legislation is too complex for that .
For example , the liberalisation of investments which is championed covers all sectors of the economy .
Ap@@ proxim@@ ately 60 % of all university gradu@@ ates are women , and yet , there are barriers effectively stopping women from making the most of their potential .
Sustainable EU financial , economic and employment policy needs to be the cornerstone of our action .
Last point : I wonder whether we should not as a matter of principle and in view particularly of the fifth framework programme also give some thought to whether evaluation as it currently stands makes any sense or not .
And , in terms of the initiative we are to adopt today , this will be all the more successful the more cities cooperate with other European cities on their projects and involve creative arti@@ sts from other cities in their campaigns .
I would also like to ask the Commission how it is preparing for these future initiatives .
We are not concerned here with a law of nature .
What is actually being done in practice is achieving the opposite of what was described here as the objective .
After all , this is not something dre@@ amed up by one party or another ; it has become clear that the promotion of renewable energies represents an important element .
We MEPs must therefore be involved in this issue as representatives of the public interest .
I thank all those who have played a part in this .
I therefore want the Member States to be ex@@ hor@@ ted to adhere strictly to the Europol Convention , in particular Article 4 , and a mechanism to be introduced to compel the Member States to supply this information .
We must help them in this , and I very much welcome the initiatives of the Spanish Presidency .
So , I do not see any reason for any stumbling blocks there - the EU has to realise this .
I wish us every success in the vote , which is to be held tomorrow .
I must therefore stress that values do not stop at borders ; we Europeans believe that values are indivisible , and we must apply them .
Commissioner , all our economic agreements with third countries need to be based on the same premise : respect for human rights .
What is needed is more cooperation with other organisations , such as the World Health Organisation or the UN , in order , quite simply , to avoid overla@@ ps and dupli@@ cations , as well as cooperation with Europol in order to tie drugs offences in with the crimes with which they are associated .
And so the ball is in the Commission &amp; apos ; s court .
However , as to whether the agreement is worth the paper it is written on , I have my doubts , unfortunately .
The Council common position largely takes account of the fundamental amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading .
There is therefore a link between the Convention &amp; apos ; s task and enlargement .
All three institutions - the Commission , the Council and Parliament - believe that this is the direction in which we must go and that the highest possible degree of harmonisation is needed if people in all the Member States of the European Union are to be able to participate in the market under what really are equal conditions .
rapporteur . - Mr President , Commissioner , in the coordination committee of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we p@@ onder@@ ed whether to produce a report on this matter or to let it pass without a report .
We need to retain this .
Mr President , Mr Barroso , following on from the questions put by my fellow Member , Mr Weber , did Commissioner Malmström inform the College that there are great concerns in this House regarding the current state of negotiations ?
If we take that as our measure , then there is an urgent need for action .
The Council of Ministers has adopted Parliament &amp; apos ; s key demands from the first reading .
Please stand up for small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises , too .
Here it states : &amp; apos ; underlined the importance of enhanced energy dialogue with the US and other key energy partners that share EU values . &amp; apos ;
The European Patent Office works in the languages agreed in the EP@@ C .
The Council welcomes the fact that the Court of Justice found that examination of the questions referred by the national court for a preliminary ruling revealed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Articles 5 , 6 and 7 of Regulation ( EC ) No 2@@ 61 / 2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of can@@ cel@@ lation or long delay of flights , and repe@@ aling Regulation ( EEC ) No 2@@ 95 / 91 .
I also wanted to ask you what you think about linking transition periods in the Member States and the candidate countries in the sort of package deal that is constantly being discussed .
We need to strike a balance between the two and not allow one interest to prevail over the other .
Parliament has insisted on the best possible utilisation of funds for this purpose .
Sci@@ ence and research without a conscience would be humanity &amp; apos ; s ruin .
It is very important that the national electronic registers containing the data should be interconnected so that data can be compared and the regulation therefore serves its intended purpose .
Respect for human rights in the classi@@ cal sense is one of the cornerstones of the European understanding of values , which will be reinforced by the creation of this new body .
We ask for this to be duly corrected .
However , we do want to extend economic relations , to dismantle trade barriers and to encourage greater investment in Russia .
That does not worry me , but what does worry me is the shape and form of the amendments to the present regulation .
The EU must be a reliable and trust@@ worthy partner .
What was the Council &amp; quot ; s response ?
There should be an opening , with the exception of the &amp; quot ; Chan@@ ges in Com@@ pet@@ ence &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; Charter of Fundamental Rights &amp; quot ; areas , which must , of course , continue to be covered by the existing procedure .
As a committed pro @-@ European European , I cannot give my approval to the new European Commission .
We know all of that , and it is up to us , the Council and the Commission to achieve it .
I share the view - as I emphasised during my hearing before this Parliament back in September - that it should be our aim in reforming the financing system to strengthen the financial autonomy of the Community .
The presidency is urging the US to allow all EU citizens to enjoy what is known as the US Visa Wa@@ i@@ ver Programme , and this , too , will be discussed at the summit .
We know all your arguments .
This is not a problem specific to the candidate countries of the European Union .
Commissioner , I would like to express my appreciation to you and your colleagues in the Commission for presenting this legislative proposal .
Politics must be taken over by a democratic legitimate civil government .
Secondly , the quality of the products must also be controlled .
Three Member States have not yet transposed the directive , four have done so defici@@ ently and inadequately and three Member States have received communications from the Commission that could potentially lead to proceedings at the European Court of Justice .
The Commission is glad that your House accepts and endorses the general principle underlying this amended proposal for a directive , and I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Z@@ ing@@ are@@ tti .
SMEs need access to capital markets , research and development , and this is something the Commission must address in the SME programme it presents .
This has to change , but we will discuss this together .
Other mechanisms must be brought into play here , because this is a regional , rather than a sectoral problem .
This proposal is on the table today and I hope that it will receive a majority vote tomorrow .
I feel that one should , of course , consider stock market prices as well .
I am relying on the Member States to take on board the safety evaluation , the standards and the necessary measures proposed by the experts and to put these things into practice in their countries and their nuclear power stations .
On the subject of Mrs Stenzel &amp; apos ; s report , I would like to congratulate her very warmly on it .
I think it is important that we ourselves should take on board citizenship of the Union , with everything that it implies , and give it serious thought .
Madam President , we regard the establishment of a European Human Rights Agency as a major contribution to strengthening the hand of all the EU institutions .
It is important in this respect to maintain the balance between employers and employees on which the acquisi@@ tion of pension rights depends .
Following on from that , we will have to define minimum standards for supplementary insurance in Europe if we wish to achieve and further develop a reasonably equitable and socially balanced health @-@ care care system in the EU worthy of the name of a social Union .
This is only the case , however , if the Chinese Government , too , stops deliberately raising certain issues as stumbling blocks .
I think this reduction should also be reversed .
It must also meet with vigorous protest in the European Parliament .
Above all , it is only over the next year that we will see what impact the Treaty of Lisbon has really had on our work .
Mr Fischer , I have listened to you carefully and given the quality and scale of the debate we are holding here today it would be wrong of me to start off by ad@@ vising you what limit values you should change and which individual environmental legislative acts urgently need renewing , even if I would like to do so and indeed could do so in detail .
It follows that quality and qualified market access are what is needed to enable the countries of the developing world to enjoy our price levels and standards and to develop their own economies .
There is still much to be done .
Being a convinced advocate of the environmentally @-@ responsible responsible market economy , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the possibility of Member States lev@@ ying duties at less than the stipulated minimum rates on products com@@ posed of biofuels .
We should tell the Americans quite clearly that we are prepared to do this and that we want to shoulder this responsibility .
We should therefore proceed cautiously - very cautiously - when it comes to the issue of migration .
In weighing up these concerns against the progress made , we decided to offer you our support for the next five years .
If I conclude that these assumptions will need to be revised , then I will inform Parliament immediately and , I will , of course , make it my business to enter into discussion with the Committee on Budgets on how the situation should be handled .
Combating internationally operating criminal organizations is a great challenge for the European Union and its Member States .
We must watch out that we do not fall into an ambiguous situation here and apply double standards .
We did of course note with satisfaction its invitation to the OSCE and ODIHR to observe the elections , which is without doubt a positive step , and one that we certainly welcome , but we are still concerned about the worsening situation in Belarus , and have justifiable cause for concern as to whether these elections will be conducted in a democratic manner .
It is a simpler and more manageable proposal .
Jean @-@ Claude Claude Juncker , the Euro@@ group Chairman , has just announced that growth will decline , that in 2008 it will no longer be 2.@@ 7 % , but 1.@@ 6 % , 1.@@ 7 % or 1.@@ 8 % .
I welcome the fact that the regulation concerning statistics on plant protection products will complete the legislative package of European plant protection policy , which can then enter into force .
What do we learn from this ?
- Mr President , a debate on the removal of the arms embargo on China has a natural tendency to produce cru@@ d@@ ely @-@ drawn drawn arguments and discussions , and , as I believe that certain Members are over @-@ simplifying simplifying matters , I will try to introduce a few nuances into the debate .
We have not yet achieved equal pay for equal work , nor do we have more women in positions of leadership and more flexible child care .
The second point that we , of course , need to deal with very decisively is the current financial crisis , which under certain circumstances will restrict still further the ability of some Member States to take action with regard to infrastructures and the associated investments that are needed .
The large majority by which the resolution was adopted demonstrates that Europe &amp; quot ; s deep concern about Iran &amp; quot ; s nuclear programme is shared by the international community as a whole .
The struggle against &amp; apos ; impunity , is not just one of the main pillars of the European Union &amp; quot ; s foreign policy , but also one of the foundations underpinning all states governed according to the rule of law .
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Uganda : B@@ ah@@ at@@ i Bi@@ ll and discrimination against les@@ bi@@ ans , ga@@ y men , bis@@ exu@@ als and trans@@ gender people .
The debate will begin tomorrow morning with an oral question , and the vote will be held at mid@@ day .
That is why I have proposed to extend the legal base by adding Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union .
However , looking at the current situation , we seem not to have come any closer to achieving these goals .
Their use is prohibited in the European Union for good reason .
I think that the accession partnership which we have tabled is the best way of supporting this process and of ensuring that the European Union is able to exert the necessary influence on the process itself .
This investigation is under way .
But we must bear in mind that the development impact of each euro must be enhanced with a view to sustainability , and here I mean both ecological and economic sustainability .
Madam President , Mr Oettinger , as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets concerning Mrs Van Bre@@ mpt &amp; apos ; s report , I can say that the members of the committee very much welcomed this report .
I want to debate this matter on 4 February in the European Council in order once again to see clearly how seriously the governments are taking this and I will then come back to you with a concrete proposal for a new energy efficiency plan .
Economic institutes , national ministries and also the Commission have not answered this question .
At the heart of the association agreement is the creation , at all levels of the hierarch@@ y of EU authorities , of a joint committee through which Norway and Iceland will play their part in the shaping of decisions .
One reason for this has been the very good preliminary work of the Commission in this case .
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them .
Mr President , I should gladly like to try that .
Many people &amp; apos ; s livelihoods are at risk , and they need help in the short term .
The clause must not remain an in@@ significant piece of rhetoric and the agreement must not be a general ab@@ solution for the government .
We urgently need to do something about the violation of intellectual property rights , smuggling and counterfeiting .
in writing . - I am voting in favour of Mrs Weisgerber &amp; apos ; s report on type @-@ approval approval of hydro@@ gen powered vehicles .
Something needs to happen here , and fast .
Hel@@ p him to secure the Stability and Growth Pact .
The Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party approves Mr Souchet &amp; apos ; s amendments here .
And it is timely , because the internal market will quite simply never be completed unless we put an end to harmful tax competition in the European Union and make further progress in the areas of tax alignment and tax coordination .
We learn with interest that the work on the Directive on the procurement of defence equipment is well advanced and that the Commission intends to present a proposal in autumn .
The demand for fundamental Union rights , combined with the request that the treaties be constitu@@ tion@@ alised , does not mean that a United States of Europe lies at the end of the road .
I stress this because the Commission &amp; apos ; s accounting has been and is a subject of public debate and a lot of things are said that are not always entirely correct .
If we are trading and importing un@@ processed foodstuffs that are then processed here and shi@@ pped back with export subsidies - which again distorts the terms of trade - that cannot help to solve the problem of hunger .
I should like to concentrate on the Hoppenstedt report .
The idea behind this directive is also that European companies are different from American and Japanese ones , and work best if a consensus is achieved between the companies and their employees by means of information and consultation .
Once again , I thank the rapporteur for the good cooperation .
We will tighten our belts , even in this Budget procedure .
the two belong together .
However , we will have to discuss this question when we come to consider the material proposal from the Commission .
I nonetheless believe that we are united as to our goal . It is only the path about which we disagree .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to express my surprise that the President of the European Commission is not here today .
Some revision is needed here .
We must nevertheless make it more competitive ; we aim to increase competitiveness , create jobs and take our environmental responsibilities seriously .
In my opinion , such an important decision must on no account be taken over the heads of the population , and that is why I have abstained in this instance .
Unfortunately , our motion was rejected , along with a series of amendments that had been tabled , which is why we voted as we did .
It also needs to be stressed that the Fundamental Rights Agency is something about which Parliament is engaged in talks with both the Commission and the Council , and in these we have endeavoured to get the agency a clearly del@@ ine@@ ated mandate .
So it is urgent to set new emphas@@ es and priorities within the programme .
This diversity must be preserved within the European Union , and I am pleased that we have addressed this point clearly in our report through the amendment tabled by Mrs Berès and others .
As regards the debate on the financial framework for enlargement , let me , as Budget Commissioner , reiterate that , in producing its proposals , the Commission has had to be guided by the principle that a proper balance has to be struck between the interests of the present Member States and those of the new ones .
Mr President , I have just one brief clarification and question to put to the Commissioner , with whose presentation I personally agree .
Secondly , the Iraqi people must then have the opportunity to take their own decisions , and the United Nations - rather than one of the bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent parties - must assume responsibility for the reconstruction of the country .
The Commission should make it unmis@@ tak@@ ably clear that infringing minority rights represents an infringement against the values of the EU .
Firstly , I would like to make it clear that the opinion I am presenting represents the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , even if my own views are somewhat different .
Acc@@ ess to energy is vital for every individual , for economic development and for the fight against poverty .
While we all sit at home , re@@ ple@@ te after a good sup@@ per , our TV scre@@ ens show us de@@ pressing new evidence of the suffer@@ ings of a people pla@@ gu@@ ed by d@@ rought and hunger .
For this reason , we have to attempt to secure democracy and stability there .
The reform process , too , is set to continue .
Commissioner , I am pleased to hear that certain measures are to be taken .
This reform will undoubtedly help to achieve this goal in a way that is not to be underestimated .
( Applause from the right , hec@@ kling )
However , I think that a small country , a new Member State of the European Union , that has run such a good Presidency also deserves to be thanked and praised by the European Parliament !
Unfortunately , a number of good amendments were rejected .
This action can restrict those concerned in some of their rights , such as the right of access or the right to information , if this is necessary for the protection of important financial or economic interests of the European Union or of a Member State .
I hope that Members of this House will support the motions we have tabled on this subject , which seek to promote apprentic@@ eshi@@ ps in SMEs .
De@@ aling with this disaster in the short- , medium@@ - and long @-@ term term is therefore the job of these regions , the national governments and the European Union .
You said that Europe 2020 included measures to exploit the potential for the creation of green jobs in the European Union .
I would like to thank everyone and I am looking forward to the discussion .
This Parliament has expressed its support for this many times .
I find that very anno@@ ying and regrettable , and ask you , Mr President , to see to it in future that rapporteurs represent the position of their committee .
But we do not agree with him on the subject of the quota .
After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union , the differences between the regions in the Union have increased .
A clear division of tasks is now emerging within the European Union .
In my opinion , we should be bol@@ ting the door against Brussels &amp; apos ; creeping desire for ever more centralisation .
The European Union must counter these developments by demonstrating the courage of its own convictions to a high degree .
The first concerns the establishment of uniform procedures so that speedy , sure decisions can be taken .
Commissioner , all this could take on the same dimensions as BSE . I think that there is an urgent necessity for the Commission to turn to scientific work and in the first instance to take the preventive action that Sweden has already taken , namely banning prophylactic use in animal food , and for us to develop scientific bases in order to hold our own in WTO negotiations .
This is a task for the Commission .
Parliaments exist to give expression to what the public feels , and you are right to say that high diplomacy belongs somewhere else ; this is where the truth has to be told .
Mr Busquin , I call upon the Commission , its President and all its members : please make Europe &amp; apos ; s voice heard !
If the declaration is worth anything , let it be debated briefly and early in the morning , rather than at the end of a long and perhaps rather problematic debate on the Council , with different groups pulling in different directions .
Mr President , I rise to make a point about the vote : it would be quite possible to challenge this vote either because of non @-@ observance observance of the 24 @-@ hour hour deadline , or , possibly , because of the quorum position .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , the governments plan to ask the Irish Government what prompted the &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; vote .
In actual fact , freedom of religion was intended to be applied against a State that prohi@@ bits the practice of religion in public .
But it must be laid down in writing that every Member State has a duty to make a personal contribution in terms of receiving refugees .
They get involved in society through other organisations of civil society , such as citizens &amp; apos ; action groups and non @-@ governmental governmental organisations .
In future , when we will have an even stronger European internal market and will gain European powers , as Mr Sarkozy has of course planned , then the European Parliament as an elected institution in Europe must be involved in genuine control , a control that we have in the national parliaments , but do not yet have in the European Parliament .
I would like to thank Commissioner Bonino in particular , and of course her staff .
It is no less significant that , the internal policy of the enlarged Europe being a work of peace , we are developing it into a real , outward @-@ looking looking common European peace policy .
I also insist on the need for synchron@@ isation of the financial perspective with the legislative term of Parliament and the Commissioners &amp; quot ; term of office , and let me make one last point , Mr President .
This report , however - provided the Council supports it - could put the common agricultural policy on a new course , one that is closer to the ideas of the majority of citizens .
It is particularly important in this regard that they work on common form@@ ats for financial institutions reporting to super@@ vis@@ ors , in order to avoid duplication of costs .
In the new Member States , around five million people are out of work , and the number is increasing , particularly among older people , women , single parents and workers without adequate skills .
That has all been said .
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service .
We do not know who the perpetrators are .
In this respect , I believe that if Parliament under@@ takes , in this particular instance , to make a transfer to the first pillar today , then this will also send out a signal for future developments in the common foreign and security policy .
Such is the reality of the situation today .
Then people said : &amp; apos ; We shall reach agreement . &amp; apos ;
We agree , Mr Kyprianou , that EFSA should continue to be responsible for risk assessment and the Commission for risk management .
In the case of the Services Directive , the Council sta@@ yed as fai@@ thful as possible to Parliament &amp; quot ; s compromise .
In every speech I have heard today , I have heard reference to the social Europe being the core and basis that holds our society together .
I believe that what has been said here is right .
Mr President , Mr Schwaiger , I would like to thank your for dealing with this complex matter so thoroughly and for seeking to forge a path towards a broad consensus .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe there are a few things that are beyond dispute , like the transatlantic partnership - since it really is the foundation of our foreign policy - the common fight against terrorism and also the cooperation of the EU institutions .
While we are not running an election campaign , we are ready to inform , to explain and to answer the questions that citizens are quite entitled to ask .
A further important aim for us was to ensure that the standards for disabled people using lif@@ ts were not compromised as a result of the revision of the Directive .
But we are also against quite simp@@ lis@@ tically no longer giving assistance in the areas set out in the Euratom Treaty , e@@ .@@ g@@ . in relation to research and also to safety standards .
The committee also takes the view that the response to the procedural shortcomings criticised by the Court of Auditors should be for a minimum degree of competition to be required , in particular in the tendering and award procedures .
I am sorry to report to you that the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s competent committee has rejected the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal , and I regret to have to tell you that there is organised opposition to this proposal - I am sure you can imagine who it is that is organising that opposition .
Secondly , everyone in this Parliament condemns the illegal executions that Israel is carrying out .
I should also like to thank you , Commissioner Wallström and the Chairman of the Conciliation Committee , Mr In@@ go Friedrich .
So long as there is European regulation , so long as there is European law , it must be adhered to rather than b@@ ent .
That is why we shall abstain in the vote , but it does not mean that we do not approve of this resolution and the g@@ ist of its content .
That is why I am asking for your support .
I should therefore like to ask the Commission if it now has sufficient resources .
Then we would be on the right track .
For this , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , I would like to thank you and , especially , Secretary of State Miguel .
Naturally , the Council is not bound by what Parliament wants , but it is required to give careful consideration to Parliament &amp; apos ; s view .
That is the innovative side of our approach , and its importance should not be underestimated .
If we vote in favour of a debate , we then come to the question of whether to table a resolution .
I would like , therefore , to start by congratulating him on the document we have before us .
Turning to labelling , I am very pleased that the consumer @-@ friendly friendly system of labelling genetically modified food and feed has been accepted .
We managed to achieve this in a spirit of good European solidarity .
We are talking about our desire to protect nature , and , above all , the health of those people who use chemicals , whether as consumers or as workers with them .
This means that we must reflect on how we can develop the existing mechanisms and approaches in the field of justice and home affairs and , as the rapporteur just mentioned , integrate them into the external relations of the EU .
Therefore , we all have a responsibility .
With the enlargement of the EU imminent , everything should also be done in the form of cross @-@ border border programmes and assistance with border management in order to avoid er@@ ec@@ ting new dividing lines in Europe .
The Committee responsible has kindly adopted all our respective amendments .
I have to say , we are still only halfway through the debate where this is concerned .
The European Union should make climate protection and the Kyoto Agreement its key priority in relations with the US .
I accept the criticism , but I think that this issue is something that would need to be resolved immediately after the elections for the entire parliamentary term .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in your speech today , Commissioner , you mentioned the contribution made by the cohesion policy to climate protection .
Another subject that is frequently discussed is the need to strengthen local government and , particularly in southern Serbia , the need to give the Albanian minority fair representation in the local authorities , where the rules have hitherto been stac@@ ked against them .
It reads : the Commission wants to improve its communications task , get the idea of Europe across and raise citizens &amp; apos ; awareness of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The Committee on Budgets has made a proposal on this score - and we urge Parliament to support this at the vote - to the effect that all future Community actions that are decided on should require fresh parliamentary decisions .
As I did not want to risk the committee adopting such a contradictory report , I finally refrained from submitting the amendments I have referred to , but I still have serious misgivings .
While repeatedly denoun@@ cing supposed human rights violations in Israel , Parliament is treating human rights violations on the part of Arab dictatorships and the Palestinian administration with much greater caution .
We , too , as people in positions of political leadership in the EU or at national or regional level , can and must give a good example by promoting tolerance , understanding , mutual respect and peaceful coexistence , and we also need to keep a watchful eye on the Commission &amp; apos ; s monitoring activities in the countries that are candidates for accession or have the potential to be such .
As far as others are concerned , they have been made aware of it . We have also set up certain research programmes to help to find solutions .
I believe that when we take a good look at how successful the ERASMUS programme has been , whereby university students in Europe can study in different countries , make friends in other parts of Europe , and discuss it afterwards among their friends and contacts , it is clear that it makes an essential contribution to mutual understanding in Europe .
We need greater transparency and clarity so that the figures can be examined more easily .
However , in my opinion , it does not provide clear , decisive and positive answers to the important questions , such as whether the EU will be able to stand on its own feet in the long term or whether it will maintain its very close links to NATO and , therefore , will hand over its foreign policy responsibilities to the USA .
Another reason why I did not endorse the so @-@ called called &amp; apos ; compromise &amp; apos ; amendment is that it would lead to what amounts to renationalisation .
And the ones who need to do something about this are not so much the Commission and ourselves , but rather the Member States , who so far have not done their homework .
Let us give the Stability Pact to the Commission and , perhaps , to one other wise man , Mar@@ tti Ahtisaari , in addition , so that it really is a success for the entire region and for the European Union .
Central features of this are the question of the group of participants , the fixing of the exchange rates between the participating Member States and the personnel heading the European Central Bank .
If we work together , it will succeed .
If , however , that is the wish of the House and it is also made clear that we are of course on the side of the demonstrators , as we have always said , then we could agree a compromise to the effect that we are in favour of a debate , as proposed , but will not table a resolution at this point , which does not prec@@ lude the possibility that next time , when we know how things stand , we also adopt a resolution .
The European Union should not , however , be indifferent to what is happening in this the most popul@@ ous country in Africa .
I wish you a successful , positive stay in Brussels and visit to the European Parliament .
The aim must not be to restrict the market but to open up new markets .
I believe that this is an important message for the voters and the citizens of Europe .
But it has not , and our progress can only be undermined if this is the message coming across .
That does of course involve the realisation of the single market for services , including financial services .
I am pleased to pay you the compliment , Commissioner , but I would have said it anyway : it must be the Commissioner who speaks for the European Union .
Firstly , as regards the Association Council , there was full agreement between the Member States and the Commission on what we should say about this issue , and also between the Presidency and the Commission .
The first reason , he says , is the size of the euro area economy , which accounts for around 16 % of world GDP , in comparison with the United States &amp; apos ; 21 % and Japan &amp; apos ; s 8 % .
We note , namely , that Member States &amp; apos ; participation in the common policies varies considerably .
What we should really call it ultimately becomes the second question .
As far as my group is concerned , in addition to a number of other important topics , some of which have already been addressed , there is a central issue on which we cannot agree with the Commission .
- We therefore call on China to bring its influence to bear in Sudan in order that the sta@@ tioning of UN troops in Darfur may be agreed to without delay .
- in the knowledge that the concept of a &amp; apos ; court order &amp; quot ; is not to be found in all Member States ,
This was a topic which we were able to focus on this morning .
However , I rise to address the issue of Question Time again .
We wish the Commission every success in evaluating the results of the Green Paper .
We will do what we want and if we recognize something as right , then people simply have to do what we want .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has proposed , as I do myself , to follow the recommendations of the legal service , which quite rightly points out that the inclusion of the terms &amp; apos ; purpose &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; scope &amp; apos ; among the powers given to the Commission would allow the latter to modify the obligations of the Member States , the authorities and the central banks , as well as its own obligations .
It has also already become harder to reach unanimity on the subject of what minimum or maximum regulation should be like .
Please allow me , therefore , also to make a few comments for the last time from the point of view of budgetary control and to offer a few additional suggestions in keeping with the tone set by Mr Nassauer .
One of the requirements of a transparent approach to international fisheries agreements is to consider who benefits from such agreements and on the basis of what criteria access to third @-@ country country waters is granted .
Reference has already been made to the overla@@ p of work between regulatory authorities .
These agreements are very important for air travel and , therefore , for the European Union .
These are the two Community aspects that we in Parliament must discuss .
I would like to underline again that the position taken by the Heads of State and Government with regard to the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal on charges for trans @-@ frontier frontier money transfers is surely a step in the right direction .
Given all these factors , it is with hor@@ ror that we contemplate what Communism has done in the country .
However , my political experience has also taught me one thing - we are all politicians , and that includes you , ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats : when no more progress can be made politically , then the agenda has to take the blame .
You have once again reminded us that monetary policy can be no substitute for economic and cyclical policy and a corresponding structure , and our priorities must be adjusted accordingly .
I hope that this form of cooperation will facilitate far more intensive work on various themes and closer cooperation with our colleagues on the ACP side .
We do not have that at present .
The requirement for transparency has not been introduced in most Member States of the European Union without good reason , and that is to give the people the opportunity to understand the political activities , to be able to establish accountability and then perhaps also to enable different decisions to be made in elections .
However , today we may well ask how the mobile workers , meaning everyone employed in transport , could possibly have remained excluded from the general social rules on working time , periods of rest and driving time .
The European Commission has presented a Green Paper on energy policy , and that I very much welcome .
I can only hope that Mr Harbour &amp; apos ; s report meets with broad support tomorrow .
Things have come to such a pass that the Commissioner responsible said yesterday , in an interview with the &amp; apos ; Financial Tim@@ es &amp; apos ; , that he was withdrawing the Commission proposal , despite our calling on him for there to be a regulation in Europe , and even though Barcelona puts us under pressure of time .
First , the report shows a certain tendency towards more protection from international competition on the grounds that fisheries provide a great many jobs in certain coastal areas .
Overall , I am pleased that the proposal has met with your broad support .
From my remarks you will see why the Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party gives its support , and I would ask Parliament to give its approval to this Agreement in its to@@ tality .
in writing . - The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) receives annual funding of EUR 500 million with the aim of providing financial support to workers affected by major structural changes in world trade patterns .
I am very pleased about that .
If we succeed in that , we shall also have moved much further forward in our policy towards Turkey .
Hence my request to the Commission : we want to continue working with you on a basis of trust .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our task is to vote on a Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget - the first this year - which was adopted by the Commission on 31 January and has already been adopted by the Council on its first reading .
As Mr Casaca has already said , the Agency has done a very good job , and I think that the EU can be proud of itself for creating it .
Personally I shall also strive , as the former rapporteur on Turkish matters in this House , to achieve these new relationships between Turkey and the European Union .
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Commissioner .
As Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs , what is your view of this delay ?
Has the Commission really thought this through ?
I assume we will receive that report in a few days &amp; apos ; time .
First we vote on whether to hold a debate .
I believe the Commission has come up with a proposal containing many sound ideas .
We , therefore , need a very clear signal .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think our duty in this matter is thre@@ e@@ fold .
For this reason there have been extensive discussions with the Commission in recent years whenever the large countries were involved - France , Italy and Germany .
There is no doubt that this is a difficult business .
So far , the Council has not made the choice as to whether to go for a uniform European Statute or twenty @-@ five five differing assessments of the same work , and so , to put it briefly , our development from a parliamentary assembly into a European Parliament has not yet been completed .
Both texts - that of 13 April and this one - must be read in conjunction with each other as a contribution to Parliament &amp; apos ; s own reform process .
The Commission has a task here , and I ask the Commission to do what the report says , namely to initiate legislation .
This approach requires efficient coordination at the level of the European institutions .
Just two further brief remarks .
Madam President , I too would like to very sincerely thank the Court of Auditors for its report and also for the assessment that the Court gave the Committee on Budgetary Control yesterday , in which it stressed once again the much @-@ needed needed efforts being made at reform .
Mr President , when it comes to enlargement policy , we need something along the lines of a regulatory framework .
The Article 36 Committee , in January 2007 , examined this instrument on the basis of a German compromise proposal , which is itself largely founded on the Luxembourg compromise proposal from 2005 , which the great majority of the delegation saw as a potentially sound basis for an agreement on the framework decision .
Also , if individual agreements are to be concluded , then the smaller states need to be included , not just through trade associations .
We had a number of preliminary discussions together .
Let me take the opportunity presented by your question to appeal earnestly to the representatives of the Turkish community in Cyprus to return to the negotiating table and to be prepared to contribute , through UN proposals , to a substantive and lasting settlement of the problem .
Israel &amp; apos ; s colonial policy is endangering the State of Israel .
Firstly , of course , we need a commitment not only from the banking associations , but we need a Europe @-@ wide wide commitment from the banks themselves .
I think I can say , at least for myself and on behalf of parts of my group , if not for the majority , that we can support this report in good conscience .
My second remark follows on from what Mr Nassauer said : the Convention puts Parliament , too , in a new position of responsibility .
The Member States must ensure that the applications are monitored more carefully at a national level .
If we were going to expand into Belarus and the Ukraine I would be happy to talk about eastward enlargement .
Ex@@ ten@@ sive amendment of the Commission text is therefore called for .
The Commission took a step in the wrong direction by assuming , as it originally did , that state bodies could make good the lack of competition and would , in cases of doubt , be more competent to judge which parts of the Member States &amp; quot ; network infrastructure were in need of investment .
This dual status has raised both problems and questions , as can be seen from the report that we are debating today .
There is too much at stake to keep Parliament on the sidelines on the preparation of Agenda 2000 , which is supposed , after all , to prepare the European Union for the new millennium and the period beyond .
My third point is that the money must be spent in Europe .
They are of course focusing on the past again .
Mr President , Mr C@@ ush@@ nah@@ an , allow me to express my thanks to you , too , for your words of encouragement and your warm welcome .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , I would like to state that we explicitly support the mandate for the chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Alain Lamassoure .
That is and remains mainly the task of Member State legislation , although it certainly does not prec@@ lude a consensual agreement on certain basic values in a dialogue with all concerned at European level .
We must refrain from everything that is a hindr@@ ance to this peace .
rapporteur . - Madam President , Mr Vice @-@ President President , ladies and gentlemen , as a post@@ scri@@ pt to this report , since the process is apparently drawing to a close , let me take the opportunity to express my sincere thanks to all those Members who have supported me in this work over a period of more than one and a half years .
As regards measures in favour of mountain regions under other Community policies , I would like to say a little more about competition policy and about general interest services .
At the heart of this reform process must lie the long overdue acceptance of the majority system in the Council of Ministers as the fundamental decision @-@ making making instrument for this Parliament .
On the other hand , we must not impose unnecessary burdens on small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises with regard to off @-@ premises premises contracts .
That should be clear to all of us here .
The Common Position of the European Union , as adopted on the occasion of the 2005 review conference , remains , unchanged , the basis of these even @-@ handed handed positions by the EU .
I warmly welcome this step , although I personally consider the transitional period to be too long rather than too short .
S@@ plen@@ did !
All these points are reason enough to call on the Commission to undertake its own comprehensive study .
More generally speaking , however , rather than simply ignoring this trouble spot , the European Union needs to do more on both sides to drive the peace process forward .
This is a new principle and an important contribution to the simplification of procedure , an important step in cutting red tape , and I am confident that the Commission will ensure that detailed inquiries will always find the relevant , competent consul@@ tant .
This result is certainly not quite what we had hoped and wanted .
To you , Mr Borrell , our President and our colleague , I wish three things : firstly that you may actually do what you have undertaken to do in the conduct of your office .
This express reference creates the erroneous impression that this is not the case .
. - Mr President , I should have been surprised if it did not .
What I ask , ladies and gentlemen , is that we should respect each other &amp; apos ; s points of view .
We think it is important , as Mr Watts has so rightly explained , to make the car a safer means of transport , because can kill and in@@ j@@ ure people .
But it also states that we are entitled to take up employment in one country and live in another country , for example like trans@@ frontier workers , who live in one country and have insurance in another .
The Union continues to attach great importance to stable development in South Africa , not only for the sake of the people there , but also because this is in the interests of the development of its neighbours north of the Lim@@ pop@@ o .
The committee has finally faced up to its responsibilities and has improved significantly on the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal .
The Pact is flexible enough as it is .
It has already been pointed out that the systems in different Member States are very different , and we do not want to change that in general either .
Conversely , individual Member States owe each other millions of euros - mere declarations of intent are not enough in such cases .
We did this in the case of Belarus and we should do the same in Russia .
This rather grandi@@ ose title covers the efforts of the European Council to achieve tangible progress that is also measurable by individual citizens .
This applies not only to the United States but also to Japan , Canada , Australia and many other countries .
For this too , I should like to thank you personally , D@@ r Merkel , together with all the members of the German Government and the German Represent@@ ation .
I am glad that he concluded by saying that he is on our side if we adopt it as proposed - and I can tell him that we will .
It has taken us five months - needless to say because of s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ try in the Council - five months to come to a decision on the package now before us .
It is therefore important to remain focused on this issue , as I said earlier .
Mr President , honourable Members , as Mr Färm has underlined , the purpose of this debate is to prepare the joint sitting of Parliament , Council and Commission prior to the Council &amp; apos ; s first reading of the 2003 Budget .
Let us not forget , in this connection , that differences still exist in the national traditions of administration and have to be taken into account .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr Radwan , ladies and gentlemen , I warmly welcome this report and this debate because I think we are prob@@ ing some really sensitive issues , and we are doing so on a genuinely cross @-@ party party basis .
The European Parliament must make proposals that take account of the interests of refugees and asylum @-@ seekers seekers in the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mrs Záborská and the members of the Committee on Women &amp; quot ; s Rights and Gender Equality for tackling this extremely important issue .
At the end of July , further discussions took place , and we hope that the British Government will now give a swift answer , so that the programmes can finally be approved .
That is also something which should not be forgotten .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank you , Commissioner Ashton , on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , for the information that you have given us this evening in the extraordinary committee meeting and here in plenary .
In my view and in that of the presidency , this compromise text achieves a great deal , on the one hand delivering clear added value on the internal market in services and the freedom to provide services , while on the other saying a clear No to any risk of social and wage dumping .
It is our only chance of miti@@ g@@ ating farmers &amp; apos ; loss of earn@@ ings , at least in the medium term .
Surely it follows , therefore , that we should take a joint approach to the challenges which are involved in this process of structural change in Eastern and Western Europe , and learn from one another ?
Her@@ s is an excellent report which demonstrates the productive cooperation between the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - To the first question I should like to reply that it is surely not the Commission &amp; apos ; s job to deliver a judgment on which methods a Member State uses to combat tax evasion by its citizens .
That needs to be recognised .
It is my belief that we have to consider these topics in the overall context of the development of the Baltic region as a whole .
Madam President , I admit that that is difficult to assess .
It is not enough to esp@@ ouse common principles only to allow the Member States full freedom in the end - common principles must be adhered to through common rules . That is why this Directive aims to protect consumers .
It will work without new legislation if the Commission supports the market forces .
I would like to respond briefly to Mr Wynn &amp; apos ; s question on the Global Health Fund .
Again , I think it is regrettable that no one from the Council is present at this important debate .
I shall return to the subject of Kosovo later .
We will appoint the High Representative of the Union for Foreign and Security Policy , he will lead the Committee on Foreign Affairs , he will be supported by a European diplomatic service and he will be a member of the Commission , namely Vice @-@ President President of the Commission .
This is not only in Turkey &amp; apos ; s interest , it is also an important strategic interest of the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to endorse what Mrs Krehl said .
That cannot be in the interests of the general public .
This report has two sides to it .
Secondly , we need to make provision for any future incidents or disasters ; in other words , we need a European disaster recovery plan .
In a liberal economy , advertising does an important job in providing information , and it is a po@@ tent instrument for effective competition .
We cannot expect other countries to get on board if we are not setting a good example .
I think we have managed this time broadly to reconcile our positions on the important aspects with those of the other groups .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - I shall conclude , Madam President , by thanking all the rapporteurs and especially Catherine Trautmann , who has done a tremendous job , as a result of which we can expect a very large majority tomorrow .
There must finally be an end to these brutal murder weapons , land mines , not just here in the European Union , but throughout the world .
At this point I should also like to express my sincere thanks for the excellent cooperation within the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
Before I deal with that , may I thank Mr Mc@@ Mil@@ lan @-@ Scott Scott for the excellent work he has done in producing his report .
Some in this House may well welcome this , but I consider it a fundamental error .
I am delighted to tell you that responses to this were thoroughly positive , so we can assume that this initiative can rely on a sufficient level of political support across the board .
I do not want to stir up past history however , because we need to look to the future .
Now to the second question , i.e. the implementation of legislation in the European Union .
In the Netherlands , you have always been committed to European integration , and that will be of immense value in making your Presidency a success .
They are essentially dominated by the governments , and what the government proposes is often implemented in the parliaments .
That is the major concern that was expressed in the referenda , and it is one that we must take very seriously .
It is first and foremost a market price ; we have to accept this .
That , on its own , shows the confusion that the Council has given rise to , something that is in no way beneficial to the EU or to the President of the Commission himself .
These things must also be our concern .
Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review , there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further .
From the very beginning , the cl@@ one has the genetic age of the original . That is to say if the original is a six @-@ year year @-@ old old co@@ w , the cl@@ one will be a cal@@ f whose genes are six years old .
We want a global agreement and we also want to include in it flights from third countries .
Our task now is to ensure that we achieve this goal as soon as possible .
I believe there are still some marked differences in this respect .
In this connection C@@ ED@@ EF@@ O@@ P and EU@@ R@@ OS@@ T@@ AT must be incorporated to a much greater extent .
On the contrary , we must use them to shape this critical dialogue .
The ongoing involvement of the Arab League in Lebanon , which started immediately after last summer &amp; apos ; s war , is very important ; and so we encourage the Arab League to continue its present endeavours .
in writing . - I am voting in favour of the report on substances that deple@@ te the ozone la@@ yer .
One such test concerns the way in which the countries in the region treat their minorities .
We have afforded ample consideration to trafficking in women , thereby making it clear that we cannot accept a situation in which up to 500 000 women are smug@@ gled into the European Union in order to be sexu@@ ally exploited .
If we in Europe wish to live in security , we must commit ourselves as a partner to every aspect of the world &amp; apos ; s security , and we must be aware of the fact that , without European solutions , most of the challenges faced by this continent and the world can no longer be met .
I would be pleased if the Commission would give its attention to these issues .
Secondly , many colleagues and fellow Members have said to me that we need to shoulder our responsibilities towards Afghanistan when it comes to dealing with terrorism , op@@ ium growing , corruption and so on .
We do , however , need to have these summarised in a progress report , and that has to be based on progress reports from the Member States .
Secondly , you said that things will have to be changed - not now but in 2004 .
It ensures that the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Development , as well as the ACP @-@ EU EU Joint Parliamentary Committee are involved in the process .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for his patience , his commitment and his incredible staying power during this ten year legislative procedure .
I believe that we have also already made it clear in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy that we agree with Articles 13 and 15 in terms of the approach chosen by the Commission and presented to us here , and are not in favour of their deletion .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to thank Mr Herzog for his cooperation .
My thanks to the rapporteur once again .
Why , then , are the Member States refusing to implement the proposals that Commissioner Frattini has just described ?
We must be more specific in our statements .
But , as I have already indicated , all the countries are approaching the point at which they will be ready for accession relatively quickly .
Mr President , I too am grateful to the rapporteur for this very well presented and very effective report .
We in the European People &amp; apos ; s Party therefore support the proposal of the rapporteur , which constitutes a major improvement in many areas .
Patent law governs the legal relationship between the invent@@ or and third parties .
I would like to thank you for that assurance , but we will be watching to make sure that this actually happens .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first I want to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for their work .
This is something that this House has frequently addressed in its resolutions .
I am not convinced that the system would thereby , and automatically , be made more just , but I do understand that we , as a matter of necessity , have to give special consideration to cohesion ; that is why we have included an element of cohesion in the choice of the allocation key of the additional rural development resources that will be available in future , and that must be retained .
However , we also clearly recognise that we in Europe have a responsibility for the fate of those migrants who are turned away from our ou@@ ter borders and who find themselves unable to return to their homes , suffering human rights violations as a consequence , as in the case of these Er@@ itre@@ an refugees .
The report highlights the importance of development and cooperation , but should be even more specific .
Now for my last point : here , too , we see the Commission taking on board a proposal from this House ; in this instance , that we should work together more closely in the sphere of inter @-@ parliamentary parliamentary exchange .
We can say that afterwards in the debate .
But , politically speaking , these are extremely difficult matters because the structures , traditions and cultures differ very greatly in the individual Member States .
Among other things , our opinion states that fundamental human rights should be respected when dealing with refugees and illegal immigrants on the EU &amp; quot ; s African borders , which I recently visited with a delegation .
Finally , I would like to express my concern that , by sorting out questions of detail , the Supervisory Auth@@ orities &amp; apos ; Committee will end up leaving a decisive mark on the substance of the law on supervision , and that this means that what Parliament wants becomes less important .
The Council and Parliament have , in the past , often proven their good faith and achieved mutually acceptable compromises from mutually opposing positions .
We should not allow too many institutions to exist and the integration of the WEU and the EU forms part of this philosophy .
We as a Parliament must also ensure that you do .
I should in any case like to point out that &amp; quot ; free and fair world trade &amp; quot ; was the basis of all our work and an addition was appended here on which we should now vote .
Mu@@ tual aid and assistance in the event of natural disasters is a true sign of active European solidarity and is therefore to be welcomed and supported .
The feeding of om@@ ni@@ vo@@ res with meat and bone meal will no doubt continue to be prohibited , at that for a variety of reasons .
I think that the large states of Spain and Poland , which are so important to the European Union , must be treated with proper consideration , but they must also be made aware that they share responsibility for ensuring that the European Union continues to develop .
To date , the Commission has produced no convincing evidence of having managed projects in such a way as to achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals , and the budget data on the basis of which we have been required to take decisions are super@@ ficial .
Generally , this h@@ its the weakest members of society the hardest , but this should not lead us to confuse cause with effect .
This framework decision gives us a to@@ ol@@ box for future directives , which will ensure greater legal consistency on key issues , establishing a clear and coherent position on the CE mark in particular but also on the status of importers in the trade chain .
However , unlike the previous speaker , we believe that the Commission is not only short of staff , but also lacks the political will to enforce environmental legislation .
Naturally , that is not the end of it .
Your presence here aug@@ urs well for cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament .
I must ask therefore ask the President to report to the th@@ under@@ ous applause of this House to the Council .
I believe that a new debate on the quality of public finances in all Member States , which the Commission has grati@@ f@@ y@@ ingly initiated , can enable us to move more freely along the road to a form of investment @-@ led led growth that will create employment .
I think it is marvellous that you use that to express indirect but justified criticism of the fact that there could be more of us here , but it was our quality that you chose to highlight , and that shows what ma@@ ster@@ y of parliamentary skills is to be found in the UK .
At@@ tention has also been drawn to the EU observers who were denied access .
We therefore also agree with the verdict of the Court of Auditors , the Commission and the Council .
That is why I am calling for our work in the Convention to be completed and for a willingness to compromise to be demonstrated in that forum , so that by the end of June 2003 we will be able to present a reasonable proposal for a European constitution .
Mr Vice @-@ President President , we thank you not only for the proposal ; we also thank you for the fact that you have sta@@ yed the course until just before midnight tonight , but we like to work .
The Member States and the Commission need to optimise the effectiveness , economy and efficiency of current control systems .
I also hope that this subject will be taken more seriously in the Member States , because in any case , they now have to present reports .
Thus , what we need is openness to reform and political courage . We need to organise ourselves in such a way that we can respond to the major challenges posed by 2020 .
Many governments need to think whether they want to risk being shown by us as a Parliament to be clearly hostile to the consumer if they take this line in the Council .
This will allow us to put something into practice externally which internally represents the decisive content of democracy .
I would also like to make those people who have quite rightly put particular emphasis on the employment issue aware that the Commission has , in fact , already tabled a proposal on how the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund can be made more flexible and effective .
Like the Council of Europe and the OSCE , the Commission is of the opinion that the Baltic states meet the human rights standards completely and that the treatment of minorities in those countries is also fully in line with European standards .
These structures are reinforced , too , by the EU &amp; apos ; s relations with Mexico and Central America , with their focus on trade facilitation .
Another group , among whom I count myself , declared that the proposal had to be improved .
If we want individual citizens or even citizens &amp; apos ; initiatives to become involved in this domain , we cannot confront them with time @-@ consuming consuming and cumbersome administrative procedures that result in their having to wait up to a year and a half before receiving a definitive response to their applications .
We agree with the Commission on this .
I see this report as representing a good compromise on this difficult issue .
And a third point , if I may .
Mr President , Commissioner , you put proposals before us for a radical reorganisation of the ag@@ ri@@ monetary system in good time , some months ago .
Commission President Jacques Santer is correct in saying that integrated , coordinated action must now be taken , and without further delay .
But in this instance the Commission still has a great task ahead of it .
But let me clarify the Commission &amp; apos ; s point of view again .
And we need a high level of safety .
This would have meant it also having to adopt all the other proposed amendments that we voted on here yesterday in the simplified procedure .
We must not allow the EU to be involved in the war in Iraq or to support the occupation .
Mr President , I speak here above all as someone who believes himself to be a true friend of the State of Israel .
Madam President , this Parliament adopts resolutions on all kinds of topical and urgent problems throughout the world , and yet when something really is urgent , namely having an opinion on the Nice Summit , we hesitate .
What is needed is the courage to draw the obvious conclusions from the development of European integration and to provide the EU with sufficient funds to carry out its tasks .
This should take account of the competences pursuant to the Treaty , the Financial Regulation and the relevant provisions of the sectoral regulations .
I have also been asked whether there is any guarantee that the use of this agreement will guarantee sustainability for the future , and to what extent the satellite monitoring system actually serves to monitor fishing activities .
As I have already explained , all these considerations and proposals must be based on comprehensible control mechanisms .
I hope that the European Parliament will give a positive opinion on this proposal to enable me to move this regulation forward in the Council next Monday , on 28 February .
The Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly makes an important contribution to closer North @-@ South South relations through its interparliamentary dialogue .
We also support the idea of preferential voting , addressing in@@ compati@@ bi@@ lities and the creation and development of European lists , even though this process is frau@@ ght with major technical difficulties .
How serious are we about implementing it and how efficiently do we want to promote it ?
When the European Central Bank was established , we laid down an important principle : that of the independence of the Central Bank .
Belie@@ ving as we do that Europe has a future , we now wish you , Mr President @-@ designate designate of the European Commission , much success in presenting your team , to which we hope we will be able to give a great deal of support and a vote of approval .
So let me say that we must indeed talk about the state of democracy in Russia , but we cannot talk down to that country in a lofty and scho@@ ol@@ ma@@ ster@@ ly way .
You are right to put the emphasis on research , innovation and Europeans &amp; quot ; competitiveness .
I believe this is particularly important if we are referring to the causes of this problem and trying to suggest solutions , as for example in paragraph 4 , as regards ourselves - that is , the fact that the field of justice and home affairs must be integrated in the next institutional reform , which must take place before enlargement .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me first make a small , general observation .
I explicitly regret that my amendment to that effect did not comm@@ and a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
I therefore believe it is absolutely essential to provide for a greater degree of participation by the European Parliament in future .
We cannot say &amp; apos ; o@@ h well , that is just how speculation works , &amp; apos ; but we must see what we can do in this area .
However , I also have questions for the Commission .
We live in a global world , faced with global responsibilities , and we are in search of global solutions .
We have created a network of committees on equality with our female counterparts in the national parliaments , and in November , we will be meeting our female counterparts from the Member States , as well as those from the candidate countries .
However , we are also calling for the problem of the visa requirement that has been partially re@@ introduced by the Can@@ a@@ di@@ an Government for EU citizens from the Czech Republic , Bulgaria and Romania to be resolved during the forthcoming EU @-@ Canada Canada Summit .
This is where the European Parliament can exercise its responsibility in the framework of European security and defence policy by making its own constructive contributions .
However , if I have understood correctly , we do not have a proposal from the Legal Affairs Committee as a basis for a vote , but you did ask the Committee on Legal Affairs for its opinion .
This has not happened so far , and there has indeed been some criticism in this respect .
But they are only one step on the long and arduous journey upon which we have decided to embark .
However , we need simpler , clearer and more transparent structures and better controls in the cohesion funds , so that the money is used sustainably and efficiently .
But politics is not about taking one &amp; apos ; s cue from daily opinion surveys ; it is about doing the right thing and winning the people of Europe over to it .
I really do not think that a new law or new provisions are needed here .
As you will be aware , efforts are being made to conclude visa facilitation agreements with other countries as well .
No , what we need most of all is more efficient spending .
We will be reminded of this by the fact , amongst other things , that both countries will have to present a progress report in six months &amp; apos ; time .
Mr President , allow me to begin by saying that - as can be seen from the report - we generally endorse what the European Central Bank has done over the past year .
Such a commitment would have catastrophic consequences for smaller producers , such as those in the agricultural and vi@@ ticul@@ tural sectors .
That has not been included here yet , so to that extent this legislation needs to be developed further .
T@@ w@@ enty @-@ five five governments are not going to meet together just to do nothing ; they will work on the Treaty , and we hope that they will improve it .
A draft recommendation for a Council decision authorising the Commission to hold negotiations with the third countries concerned about this change in the bound rate of duty is currently being prepared .
We really must concentrate on the tasks in hand .
This goes to show that one disaster can trigger off the next .
The people must be able to associate their personal vision for the future for themselves and their families with Europe once again .
The Commission has quite rightly taken stock in a rather sobering way as regards coordination .
I welcome the adoption of the motion for a resolution on the Stockholm Programme .
When it was introduced , it required considerable investment ; it was fairly expensive .
My second question is this : what means are currently being applied to integrate the Kurds in Europe ?
This is an intolerable situation and that is the reason why we have spent the last few years working hard to ensure greater safety on the roads .
Mr President , in our opinion it is important that the original Commission proposal giving the Member States excessive powers to intervene was not accepted .
Very many women have no secure income of their own and are financially dependent on their families or obliged to rely on minimal incomes .
Secondly , I should like to point out that we decided yesterday to adopt the Commission proposal on which I reported .
There are three aspects here . Where do we need preliminary agreements to ensure the appropriate transition from the old to the new treaty ?
The Commission &amp; apos ; s initiative , Commissioner , is also very important .
But there is no disputing the fact that violence against women , children and young people ultimately damages their health and - very importantly - their psychological constitution .
Mr President , corruption threatens society , organized crime threatens society . Ad@@ ded dangers accru@@ e , therefore , from the interplay between corruption and organized crime .
It is very often carried out by the local representatives of the EU - including , in particular , the Troika .
My third point relates to Japan .
I am particularly delighted that two group chairmen have honoured us with their presence here at noon today .
As regards tomorrow &amp; quot ; s vote in the plenary , though , I am working on the assumption that this House will endorse this unequivocal vote in favour of Europe having its own satellite navigation system , one that will make us Europeans independent of others .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is easy to agree on principles , certainly when the principles in question make sense .
It will always be money from the Member States and please do not forget that the national parliaments , of course , also play a role here .
Moreover , I believe that there is a tremendous danger that arms cooperation at European level will produce monopolies which will then be able to dictate fic@@ ti@@ tious prices for defence products to governments .
In this context , standardisation is essential and fundamental .
We need , as a matter of urgency , to set the course for the future .
That will give you a chance to show where the Commission stands .
What matters is that the conditions are fulfilled and that emphasis is placed on price stability .
The same also applies to another project we have proposed , namely the social integration of migrants .
I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur once again for his good work .
It is therefore essential to bring about an exchange of information , and this be based in the Commission .
My third comment relates to the text itself .
Mr President , I am speaking this morning on behalf of my colleague Mr Schnellhardt , who unfortunately cannot be with us .
On the other hand , we have to recognize the fact - and I know this from practical experience - that many people do not find what they are looking for in conventional medicine .
The European Union &amp; apos ; s activity must focus more on creating the conditions that will give these enterprises a better chance .
People obviously have to watch their budget and we need to be sensitive here and not over@@ step the mark .
Given the great many directives in force , this diver@@ ges widely in the Member States .
That is the reason why we voted for the censure motion today .
Why did you not provide us with this information earlier ?
Mr President , I refer to yesterday &amp; apos ; s plenary session and the one @-@ minute minute speeches that took place at the start of the plenary session .
Mr President , I would like to say that I was very pleased by the report on recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security as this puts the significance of the rural economy back at the centre of things . The first conclusion , for me , is that we also continue to need a strong European common agricultural policy .
Commissioner , you cannot take an in@@ fin@@ ite amount of time over this .
Against such a background , the Commission has now submitted its proposal for the simplification of this inspection process .
I wish to propose , by way of a compromise , that it be translated into the languages of those EU Member States affected by the investigations .
As Parliament we can perhaps take a tougher stance than the Commission does .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly , I am pleased for both rapporteurs that their reports have met with such broad approval , not only in the Committee but also here in Parliament .
No doubt it was too late for that .
Mr President , many thanks to you , Claude .
Now , after a long discussion , as the rapporteur said , we have agreed to continue working on the Commission &amp; quot ; s approach .
A European Union that defines itself solely in terms of the redistribution of as much money as possible is not the European Union I want to see ; there are other tasks that we have to perform together .
The present proposal for a resolution and the list deri@@ ving from it must ultimately be brought into line with these existing directives .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , during yesterday evening &amp; apos ; s sitting , Mr K@@ rar@@ up tried to refer the Commission proposal , the directive and the report back to committee and to block them .
The Member States , the Council and the European Commission must look upon one another as natural partners which support one another and work together constructively to protect citizens and consumers in a manner which engen@@ ders confidence .
One reason for this is the fact that the 1996 framework agreement on trade and cooperation has still not been ratified by all Member States .
I would now like to propose that the resolution passed by this Parliament yesterday be referred to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the purposes of clarification under Article 14@@ 8 ( 3 ) . There are two specific reasons for this : Firstly , we need clarification as to which of the two resolutions in this instance is actually valid .
The attempt has often been made to create a common market organisation for alcohol in the EU .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say , first of all , how very grateful I am to Mrs Wallis for her report .
The key word for a European society of the 21st century that seeks to offer its people new prospects is &amp; apos ; competitiveness &amp; quot ; .
Despite their increasing involvement in the labour market , statistics in all 27 Member States of the European Union show that women are at greater risk of poverty than men .
There are no rights without responsibilities .
Priority has to be given to the drafting of safety data she@@ ets and their precise use in places of work , thereby ob@@ vi@@ ating accidents resulting from the improper handling of substances .
If &amp; quot ; fair and socially @-@ balanced balanced &amp; quot ; is omitted , then unfortunately the majority of us will have to vote against this report .
That is something we must constantly bear in mind .
Madam President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as commissioner .
As I know from personal conversations with them , many Members of this House very much doubt - just as I do - whether , under such conditions , they should give them their approval .
I have heard in the meantime that some Members of your Commission - presumably after consultation with you - have taken up and put forward some of the ideas that we proposed here .
The White Paper makes provision for a consultation stage up to March 2002 .
However , we also expect the type of leadership which will allow for policy making at a higher level and which will convince the Member States , despite the complex requirement for unanimity .
You are forgetting that the huge American market also domin@@ ates these two countries to a large extent .
However , we should spare no efforts in pointing out the ethically motivated limits that have been set , to which the Parliament has always attached importance .
Why do we need this initiative ?
I believe , then , that we must get started where we have the best chance of future success .
I voted in favour of the resolution on the state of the European economy proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in a report preparatory to the Commission recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines .
Thus we have not only made it possible to process visa applications quickly but also ensured that security screening prevents abuses .
The European Parliament delegation had previously voted with a clear majority of 15 votes in favour , none against and five abstentions to oppose the final conciliation attempt of the Commission .
There , the European Union is playing a positive part in the interests of stability , security and democracy .
We all know that this is a question of law for which the European Court of Justice has developed clear criteria .
This broad consensus in the European Parliament tomorrow will also set a clear challenge to the Council to make clear at its next meeting in November that it , too , will give the green light for this to go ahead , just as the Commission has already done and Parliament will be doing tomorrow .
I am sorry that I cannot stay for the end of the debate .
After all , the candidate countries have a legitimate interest in knowing what is being debated at the Intergovernmental Conference and what they will need to prepare themselves for .
In this respect we should be pleased that both reports are being debated here today and will be voted on tomorrow . Neither of the two countries concerned will have cause for complaint against Parliament .
To make fair competition possible an appropriate and efficient system of supervision needs to be set up .
We must endeavour by all peaceful means to prevent this confrontation with Iraq &amp; apos ; s criminal regime from becoming a confrontation with the Arab world .
We do not regard this as an occasion for requiring the President of the Commission to appear before us ; instead , we want to hear Commissioner McCreevy first .
We need more competition there and we must see to it that we bring about significant reductions in these costs , and that personal responsibility plays a greater part in the system .
Of course , had the European Council not achieved the desired outcome , it would not have signi@@ fied the end of Europe , but it would undoubtedly have had almost in@@ descri@@ b@@ able repercussions .
It chose as its primary objectives the eradication of poverty , sustainable economic growth , educational opportunities for all population groups , especially for girls and women , gender equality and equal rights for men and women , protection , support and encouragement for the family , facilitation of general access to reproductive health , family planning and sexual health services , and a reduction in inf@@ ant , child and mater@@ nal mortality rates .
As many speakers have already pointed out , Europe &amp; apos ; s main problem is high unemployment - structural as well as cyclical .
Madam President , the borders have been removed for the first time in Germany and Austria and we finally have free movement for workers from the countries of Eastern Europe .
There is always one concern at the back of my mind : it is frequently said in this House that sustainability strategies , resource efficiency and climate protection should be the new paradig@@ ms for European economic and industrial policy .
My group , for example , does not believe it is right that , as part of the accession process , candidate countries are urged to join the NATO military alliance .
The same conditions must apply to all countries we deal with , be they in Europe , Africa , Asia or anywhere else .
More progress is needed .
Are there adequate controls ?
I must admit that I am absolutely torn between two ways of looking at this .
A word on the White Paper : the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .
A summary report of this nature can provide us with important information with regard to what preventive measures we need to implement and make a contribution to improving the quality of worker protection in the EU .
Those who were in the Chamber just now know what I mean .
Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit Bendit , you heard me say that the EU must take a position with regard to dictators that are still in power and are currently still accepted partners of the European Union , and we should do so before revolu@@ tionary changes occur in the countries concerned with regard to human rights , democratisation and the rule of law .
We may well already have made considerable progress in changing the legal position on protection from discrimination and on the promotion of equal opportunities across the EU , but that is no reason for us to rest on our laurels , for even the best @-@ drafted drafted legislation avail@@ s nothing if the political will that it be consistently implemented is not strong enough and it is not supported by the population as a whole .
We achieved this .
We know that we must continue to strengthen the internal market .
Mr van Velzen , I think that we should actually make renewed efforts within the two large groups - and perhaps with all the others who are willing to cooperate - to reach compromises on the amendments .
The joint resolution calls for the recommendations of the report by the UN F@@ act @-@ Fin@@ ding Fin@@ ding Mission on the conflict in Gaza and southern Israel led by Justice Goldstone to be implemented , for which reason I voted &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; .
The fact is that , if we are to act on the judicial and police cooperation front , we have to do so within the framework set for us by the Treaties .
The application forms that have come into my possession are drafted in the language of bureaucracy rather than that of solidarity .
But we are responsible for the health of our citizens and we must decide on rules here .
But I should like once again to ask a very clear question here : do we want to create a charter of all imm@@ ut@@ able and inalienable human rights ?
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest .
The Committee on Budgets will have to decide whether to take sides with the Council or with the Commission and the Court of Justice .
That is why it is important that the Commission sets the direction here .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to take as my starting point the point just made by Mr Sturdy .
If this provides a way to help to keep the often high rates of interest and administrative fees for micro @-@ credi@@ ts credi@@ ts low , then it would give us an opportunity to give new impetus to the economy .
When , if not now , are we to discuss the development of a common European energy policy ?
Here we have , yet again , a case of law made by judges , the fundamentals of which need to be debated .
I would like to appeal to the Commission not to create additional bureaucracy in this area .
This would certainly help us greatly in our ongoing work of creating better regulation .
Following an intensive debate in the Committee on Budgets , we gave the green light to the mobilisation of the Fund in both cases . I would , however , like to remind you of my introductory comment where I requested that the Commission once again take up a clear position on this and I very much welcome the fact that the very fundamental issues of the mobilisation of the financial instruments from the European budget were put on today &amp; apos ; s agenda by the Committee on Budgets .
The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy says yes , if Romania wants to join these euro @-@ Atlantic Atlantic structures , then we want to support this and I think it is important , especially in Romania &amp; apos ; s case , that we do .
I am glad that we can count on the full support of the European Parliament , which is involved in every phase of this cooperation .
We want a Europe with a sustainable social market economy , fundamental rights , no discrimination , full employment , an integrated social clause , social cohesion and services of general interest , which are to be defined through subsidiarity .
The regulation on feed and food controls before us is one of the EU measures to improve food safety .
This ongoing trend will continue to have a negative effect if support programmes are not put in place for agriculture .
That is why action on this criminal court is one of the most important tasks facing the European Union in the immediate future .
We need to remind ourselves that it will be the young people who will build Europe up and ensure its future development , in other words that what matters above all is that they should find out for themselves what they want Europe to become in future .
At the moment we are also investigating this substance within our regular risk assessments , whether it should be classified at a different level or possibly use of it must be completely forbi@@ dden .
In the report , a goal is also formulated which I consider to be particularly important , namely that Europe must be seen by its citizens to be transparent and to be conducting a more open debate .
Yet I approved it in the Conciliation Committee and would now ask Parliament to do the same .
Nonetheless , in my report I have criticised several points .
However , we must ensure a clear allocation of responsibilities .
Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs . - Madam President , the reform of the European Union is difficult enough but the reform of the European Parliament appears to be even more difficult .
My third comment , if you will allow , is addressed to you , Mr da Costa : what happens in one country of the European Union is of interest to the other countries , that is perfectly obvious .
Mr President , thank you for your very sound answer .
( Parliament accepted the oral amendment )
This is an issue that needs to be solved at European level .
Who will represent the EU now ?
If , in so doing , we are only ever going to try and reduce expenditure , then it will simply not be possible to do justice to our political needs .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos , in the European Union &amp; apos ; s view , the way for Cyprus to improve its security is to continue seeking a political solution to the problem of the division of the island .
We have heard about these shortcomings in the debate as well as reading about them in the reports .
We are not holding a debate now .
We are in favour of the right to have recourse to legal action , enshrin@@ ing the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a qualitative pre @-@ condition condition for parties , European parties having legal personality and putting an end to cross @-@ financing financing .
We should like to be more specific .
On the other hand , as the debate on the Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ aut report has shown , we are faced with the major difficulty that we are not prepared to transfer powers where the nation state is still at its mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est : police and the judiciary .
I believe we must all endeavour to solve the problem of the Kurds - the economic , social , political and cultural problem of the Kurds , not only in Turkey but especially in Turkey .
Fr@@ aming this right and creating optimum conditions for it should be a key priority for this Parliament !
If we want to achieve a target of 20 % of total energy consumption being made up of renewables , then every Member State must play its part .
Pol@@ lution has repercussions for health , and we must focus more closely on this .
We are open to this process , but the task of convincing us is still to be done by the executive , in other words the ministers .
This is why we in this Parliament today shall say &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; ten times over .
I therefore share my fellow Members &amp; quot ; disappointment that no agreement was reached with the Council at first reading .
The Council regulation before us is a fairly acceptable compromise .
The fact is that all of us would have liked to see something in line with our own thinking , and , as indeed one speaker said earlier on , all this is an important step forward , but we need many more of them .
If so we will have a majority not only in the committees but also in the plenary tomorrow in favour of Herman Schmid &amp; apos ; s otherwise expert report .
This is something it would certainly be worth thinking about .
I would therefore say that this Treaty will help Europe &amp; apos ; s legislation to become more social , based on the aims you have agreed with the social partners at this summit .
I have received another two explanations of vote , both of which are from new Members .
However , I do have three questions .
By abandoning - whether out of nai@@ v@@ ety or in the service of massive national interests - any and every means of exerting pressure , the European Union is allowing all these things .
It is doubtless right for Europe to take the lead here - after all , we would have to wait indefinitely if we were to try to bring the Americans on board too .
This law must naturally be respected .
Madam President , I , too , would like to voice my backing to the accession of Serbia to the European Union and to the idea that the Serbian people have a future in a common Europe , just as the Western Balkans as a whole has .
For that reason , I must reject this Amendment .
We would like to thank the Commissioner for intim@@ ating this .
In future , we will also have to secure our supply of raw materials .
Admittedly , we have Europol as an institution whose remit covers terrorism among other things , but Europol is powerless if not all Member States comply with the Convention , supply in due time comprehensive information for the analyses required and subsequently make aid available to their fellow Member States .
It is also about funds from the Euratom programme .
Perhaps the Commission could make a contribution here too .
It is our responsibility , and it is also in our interests to do so .
They should be able to plan for their ho@@ sp@@ ital care , their specialist care , and their investments in the Member State in question should be affordable .
We live in a Europe which is increasingly under the influence of anti @-@ European European forces that are fighting against the institutions of the European Union .
Climate change , Commissioner , is a global problem , affecting entire societies rather than being confined to specific areas of activity .
Mr President , the policy of abolishing the death penalty is a very successful part of European foreign policy .
On the one hand high ranking politicians from the Member States b@@ ask in praise in eastern capitals for their statements about future prospects .
The problem , though , is that the third @-@ country country nationals within the EU constitute a sort of third class of citizens , ranking below the citizens of the country they live in and then after the citizens of the other EU countries , who are in second place .
Some governments may consider it acceptable , but the population of the Arab countries cannot approve of our current policy towards the Palestinian Government .
We must accord this political process the historic importance it deserves and enter into discussion with the citizens .
We will , of course , take this opportunity to sound out what scope there is for supporting them .
This is all about the negotiations between the European Union and the individual countries .
Many Members here today were also present .
With this in mind we must make sure that this factor alone , external value , does not weaken confidence in the euro .
This also demonstrates how important these matters are to us .
Could you perhaps ask the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to clarify this issue ? Otherwise , the interpretation made by the House &amp; apos ; s services will defeat the whole object of the reform .
Alli@@ ed with this is , though , the expectation on the part of the European Union that the reform process will be carried on consistently .
The position we are starting from could be described as extremely difficult .
In the present crisis , this stabilisation is very important .
Let me say one thing in conclusion with reference to the subject currently under debate , something of which Mr Bourlanges , who is sitting here be@@ side me , can speak with experience .
I am also prepared to explain to the citizens of the European Union , and to those of my electoral distri@@ ct , that we have to do something and that aid for others always has to be paid for by someone .
If the European Union , the United States of America , Russia and the United Nations can reach a joint position worked out by their most high @-@ level level foreign policy representatives and jointly put this over to both parties , then for the first time there will be a chance of the seriousness of the situation being appreciated by both sides .
That this is a breeding ground for corruption and international organised crime cannot be a matter of indifference to us .
- Madam President , Commissioner de Palacio , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to offer the rapporteur my most sincere congratulations and also my thanks .
The Member States have been left more room for manoeuvre where the collection of statistics is concerned .
Better coordination within the Commission is also urgently needed .
I hope we shall manage to ensure that it is .
It was not such an easy task , and I am grateful that we managed to cooperate in an objective manner and to seek out the widest possible common ground on what is not an entirely straightforward issue .
I hope that this issue will be taken up at the European Union / African Union summit meeting .
Loo@@ ked at as a whole , there is no doubt that the Convention represents an opportunity , yet Parliament contradicts Laeken by demanding that we should negotiate and reach a decision on the basis of one un@@ it@@ ary , coherent proposal .
In December 1998 , the European Parliament adopted a statute with a qualified majority , a decision which was confirmed in May of this year by an overwhelming majority .
Madam President , I am delighted that , in the De V@@ its report , we have a very good report before us and I am delighted that all our fellow Members are of one mind regarding solidarity , transparency and consumer protection .
There is therefore some uncertainty in this area as to the basis for decision making and the intel@@ ligi@@ bility of decisions , just as there still is with reference to the forecasts and models .
We also have to move matters further forward here so that we can also actually achieve the necessary security .
We are well on our way .
I just have one more request .
It is extremely important , in this respect , to make the sustainability of measures and the protection of natural hab@@ itats in our environment our guiding principles .
But on no account must we g@@ loss over this by failing to make our feelings known and by trying to conceal things in committees , which will dis@@ concert the public .
I can assure him that we are behaving like democrats .
This is an excellent idea and one that I can only welcome .
We will therefore have to uphold our legitimate demands on China .
We have to avoid it at all costs !
If Europe is to discuss values with the USA as an equal , then we have to tell them that this is not acceptable .
It can work , too .
The Convention has not yet debated Par@@ ts III and IV . It should have the right to do so , and governments should not prevent it from doing so .
We have recital 15 . Mr Dimitrakopoulos has already mentioned that there are amendments .
We would like this report to take into account the criticisms we have made , and hope that you will not hold back from this House any of the data you have compiled .
Another important point is the principle of region@@ alisation .
In doing so , Mr Schmid has pointed to the crux of the matter .
Sometimes there are what you might call neighbour disputes , but in emergencies like this we see the value of good neighbour@@ liness .
We are grateful to him for his essential contribution to making what we hope is a further improved text out of one from the Commission that was already good .
I assume that you will remain in the Commission and continue to be politically active , and perhaps we will have a little bit of time to argue with each other .
My first question relates to costs , as long @-@ term term data retention is a major financial burden , in particular for small telecommunications firms .
Following the outbreak of the second Chechnya conflict in September 1999 , the European Union has taken and maintained a clear position on the issue of respect for human rights .
I would also ask the governments of which the Council is com@@ posed to ensure that they are able to be present for the sittings in Brussels at least until the evening .
I have in fact had a perfectly clear answer about another , related matter from the Commission , but the response from the Council Secretariat was somewhat vague .
The most important objective is surely to create and develop a European democracy and to eliminate the democratic deficit .
It would be a good thing if this House were to have a joint ballot on such important issues .
Even though there were some demands that we could not get the Council to accept , I therefore recommend that all Members of this House should accept the result of the conciliation procedure and express their satisfaction with what has been achieved .
We are delighted with the energy and commitment that the Commission has shown on this and are pleased that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety has made clear , firm proposals .
If I may turn to Romania and Bulgaria , it is certainly the case that Romania still has a long way to go , but there is no doubt that it has , over the last two years , caught up to a significant degree .
When I consider the development in the last few years , I detect that there has been a basic improvement .
Cul@@ tural diplomacy has an important role to play when it comes to building successful relations with third countries and , in many countries , there is a network of national institutes for culture , EU@@ N@@ I@@ C , that we can make use of .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have undoubtedly made progress in recent years on the issue of equality between men and women , yet there are still many women who are forced into low @-@ skilled skilled jobs .
The decisions that have to be taken are of enormous political importance .
In my country it is argued that , because of the dynam@@ ics of the economy , more works councils should be set up which , for practical purposes , means for all medium @-@ sized sized enterprises .
rapporteur . - Madam President , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , permit me to make just a few remarks .
In Ukraine , we should look at the problems , but also at what is going well and at the positive changes .
There were Member States that went well beyond this minimum standard , and other Member States that only implemented the minimum standard .
This is also part of the story and should not be conce@@ aled .
This is the impetus we wish to take with us into the second half of our Presidency .
Some may wonder what we are letting ourselves in for , and others whether the Union will be put under too great a strain .
He really deserves the utmost respect for this .
This is what Parliament today declared with a large majority to be the will of the European peoples , and I appeal to the governments to join them in this .
Following the launch of the European External Action Service , will we take this opportunity to consider whether EU human rights policy is having the desired effect ?
Firstly , the fact that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights has now been drafted , Article 16 of which establishes the right to entrepreneurial freedom .
What impact that might have on the budget , we do not know .
However , I am also very concerned that we , as legislators , should give consideration to the traditional small @-@ business business structure in Europe , in order to guarantee that both the production and supply of food is sustainable , adequate and safe , even in the less @-@ populated populated areas of Europe .
Even if airlines were issued with 100 % allowances upon entering the scheme - and none of us is asking for that - an annual growth in aviation of 5 % would require an equally high volume of savings in terms of CO2 emissions .
We have to see to it that the citizens of this Europe enjoy their rights .
We have gone down the wrong road here .
One reason for this is the health of the workers .
For that reason , I believe this gives us a real opportunity to show in this House that we are serious in what we say .
I would be very grateful if the Commission could help them in that direction .
Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives , and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal .
We fully agreed the text .
I note with regret the voting pattern and have decided , in my capacity as rapporteur , to return the report .
Let me briefly mention the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
I would like to go further than that .
The problem of anti @-@ dumping dumping shows how important it is to call for environmental and social standards , in particular , and also trade protection measures during negotiations on free trade agreements with third countries .
For Europe , and for the EU in particular , this should only be of limited interest , because the EU needs to be able to define its own emphas@@ es and objectives , and its own interests .
I think we have put forward a sound proposal .
The Commission will have to provide more concrete answers to these questions in its continued work .
It is , however , extremely difficult to say where the European competence lies in this matter , what must be organised at European level and where particular devol@@ ved tasks must be dealt with .
I am very disappointed that this does not seem to be the case .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s answers were wo@@ ol@@ ly and completely unsatisfactory .
This death must not be in vain .
We are developing a climate @-@ protection protection policy in many other areas and we need it here too , which means we need to adjust and adapt .
ACP @-@ EU EU cooperation has gained a new democratic aspect , and that means that we also need to provide a new democratic dimension in shaping this cooperation .
I expect that they can be completed within a short space of time .
This too has been promised .
Without wanting to go into detail , I would say that it is important that we enable this Europe of ours to compete rather than pursuing a policy that will end up with a de @-@ industrialised industrialised Europe and the loss of jobs .
As a result , the core of today &amp; apos ; s problems consists in bureaucracy , wa@@ stage of billions of euros and - yes - mistakes in the political recruitment of Europe &amp; apos ; s elites .
I believe we have found the right way forward together there .
Under our new agreement , it will be possible for the European Union to provide them with the necessary support .
I hope this was only the gent@@ l@@ eness of the first wave , because I am absolutely convinced that the Commission , and probably also the Council , must take a fir@@ mer approach to those Member States which are in fact not mat@@ ching up to their plans , ideas and objectives .
It would be good , Commissioner , if the Commission could offer to convince a few Members of the old committee of its current security standards by inviting them to the Commission to see for themselves .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate Mr Tab@@ aj@@ di on his balanced report .
There has always been climate change , but this time , we are making our own contribution to it , and that is exactly what this is all about .
It is therefore advisable also to involve and take advantage of the European Union &amp; apos ; s existing institutions , and if appropriate extend them . The funding necessary for this needs to be made available by 2002 .
When we look at these alternatives we see that there is a very distinct trend throughout Europe towards European integration .
De@@ ep public concern has long since ceased to be enough .
Are we able to take economic and technical le@@ aps into the new age while us@@ her@@ ing in a new generation of production with higher - the highest - environmental standards ?
With its Communication on &amp; apos ; The European Union and Latin America - the present situation and prospects for closer partnership 1996 @-@ 2000 2000 &amp; apos ; the Commission has pointed the way to revi@@ ving these relations .
There is now talk of a fund , and our group asks that we take another , very careful , look at that .
Your support shows the Commission that we are on the right road .
It was not that it would not have been possible to implement it .
We believe that the report attaches far too little weight , in this area , to the protection of the environment and to the need for a truly sustainable economy .
Mr Aznar , I wish to conclude by congratulating you on the reform of the Council , which is going in the right direction ; I believe it is on this basis that we should carry on working in the future .
That is why we must make demands equally of both sides , of the Israelis as much as of the Palestinians .
If they do not , they cannot function on the market .
I would like to say at this point that Croatia has made considerable progress , particularly in recent months and with regard to corruption . Croatia has shown that no one is outside the law or exempt from measures to combat corruption .
May I therefore recommend to the House that it votes against this amendment , since I do not believe that a judgment of the Court should be over@@ turned through the back door by means of an amendment .
Estonia knows that , as a Member of the European Union , it is also obliged one day to become a member of the euro area and the fact that it wants to do that so quickly makes me , personally , very happy .
I would certainly not want farmers in countries that do not want to join the euro to be pen@@ alised .
The Commission should therefore play the role of mediator here .
My fourth and final point , and the one I consider most important , is that we must ensure that we also have a single European airspace and we must establish a uniform system of air traffic control in order to reduce delays and congestion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank Mr Liese very much for his outstanding work on this report .
As we have already heard , women are now better educated and there are far more women gradu@@ ates than male gradu@@ ates , but we have still not broken through the gla@@ ss ceiling .
Firstly , to come back to the question of the definition of security : I do not believe that we are very far apart at all .
The progress made at the weekend was not negli@@ gi@@ ble ; it was significant .
This initiative appears to be taking us in that direction , and that is why I have voted for it .
I am sure that something will be set in motion before September .
For that reason , although an agreement has to be as@@ y@@ mmet@@ ri@@ cal , at the end of the day , the tariffs must be zero .
The Commission is also to participate in the Don@@ or Conference due to take place in Tok@@ yo tomorrow and which has already been mentioned here .
Alongside the obvious benefits for the environment , this sector also offers opportunities for boosting economic growth and creating jobs .
Mr President , I asked the Commissioner a question which he has not answered .
For that reason , we must not create any unnecessary obstacles .
Bil@@ ateral agreements can of course sometimes be helpful , but they should not be a substitute for a multilateral approach .
( The President declared the common position adopted as amended )
Biogas is a stor@@ able and renewable energy source and hence of especial strategic usefulness and value .
Alterna@@ tively , let us consider local transport .
The conditions set out in it will be incorporated in the budgetary rules and their implementing provisions in due course .
In a European Union in which more and more work is done across borders , this sort of collabor@@ ative effort across borders is quite clearly very much needed and very deserving of support .
Together with the representatives of the Council Presidency - I see that Mr Haarder is present - Parliament , the Council and the Commission are engaged in the search for a common basis for dialogue on better forms of governance .
Businesses are unable to devote themselves to young people on top of the economic situation .
That might be one way of coming to an arrangement .
We have to do more on this front , especially in comparison to the United States .
Clearly , this report falls short of those proposals .
I believe the Commission is more likely to be in a position to give you a satisfactory answer .
Research and development must receive financial backing , but the focus has to be right .
Today , our sympathy , our respect and our solidarity are with the victims of the acts of terrorism and violence carried out by E@@ TA and B@@ at@@ as@@ una .
Our Europe will become what we ourselves make of it .
Here in Parliament this has been dealt with by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate the Czech Presidency .
However , I would now like to mention a couple of shortcomings .
Mrs Martens &amp; apos ; report is helping Parliament to adopt today a position on this communication , and I would like first to congratulate her and also the draftsman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation &amp; apos ; s opinion on this thoroughly constructive and tr@@ en@@ ch@@ ant report .
Parliament has to pay considerably more attention to all these issues .
These different national parties have combined in the European Parliament to form eight groups , alongside the 14 non @-@ attached attached Members .
The subsidies also enable diversity in farming and contribute to landscape conservation .
It thereby fulfils its central goal , to create a united Europe and can simultaneously learn the lessons from both recent history and from the global challenges of our age , that is the danger of war@@ like disputes , ecological destruction , dealing with poverty and discrimination by means of the ever closer economic and political integration of Europe .
We will not adopt these opinions as quickly as we have been asked to do so now for the third time .
We urge the Turkish Government to react cautiously to this situation .
Mr President , we shall also be giving our assent tomorrow .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , after lengthy pronoun@@ cements and promises , the European Union - or to be more precise , the Helsinki European Council - has formally recognised Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union .
I would therefore like to join in the thanks expressed to Karl @-@ Heinz Heinz Florenz who , as a member of a different parliamentary group but in his capacity as rapporteur , has presented a report whose contents we , as the Socialist Group , can certainly endorse .
However , I also expect the efficient use of resources , both financial and human .
Allow me to say something here on two or three key points .
I believe we should draw attention to the fact that a European bill of rights for ethnic groups and minorities is absolutely imperative .
It is my hope that this cooperation can contribute to greater understanding and tolerance between Europe and the Arab world .
We have now reached an agreement and I should like to thank all those involved for their part in achieving this : colleagues , the Commission , also the Council , and , in particular , the French Presidency .
We expressly support the negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of His Hol@@ iness , also regarding genuine autonomy for Tibet .
That is why it is extremely important from the point of view of the Turkish Cypriots for the United Nations to say that the plan will stay on the table .
The European Union should not only take financial action at the donor conference in Sri Lanka in May .
I believe that this is important for the future of the entire region and beyond .
That is the background to our demand for a separate vote on Point 16 of the Peter report , and that is why we want the section that suggests that there will be a delay to be deleted .
As the Presidency of the Council , we will of course submit the wish expressed here to the Member States , referring to all elements including the statement that has already been cited here several times .
The basic principles of this partnership include respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , together with the right to education .
Therefore , we are of the opinion that this constitutes an infringement of the Rules of Procedure - which not even the Conference of Presidents may disregard .
All in all I think that everyone has to make concessions , but this is a good compromise and I would be pleased if this House could now vote for it with a large majority .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Mr Bur@@ ke , I share your concern about rising fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er prices .
What we must aim for is that we should have a future as a democratic and energetic European Union .
The effective implementation of this agreement should safeguard the equality of status between material and intellectual property .
Su@@ d@@ denly , that is becoming increasingly difficult and , in this case , quite impossible .
Nor has the Commission yet produced its progress report .
Europe must help where it can .
I have already indicated that the Commission can make a proposal on fisheries policy only if the Member States are willing to give us the necessary figures .
We need a change of policy course .
First of all , I would like to set out the position of the Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party .
It must be equally clear , however , that there are certain ground rules in police work .
Does the Commission agree that this kind of link @-@ up up exists and share the view of the US Government , and will the Commission call for a WTO panel procedure prior to the American elections ?
That is why we should postpone it .
These education and training programmes improve individuals &amp; apos ; knowledge and abilities and equip them for the future .
This absolutely must be changed with a new proposal for a directive .
The European Union is in the process of shoul@@ dering more responsibility on the world political scene , and that is a good thing .
A cyclical economic slow@@ down is rightly identified in the report , but once again the neoliberal solutions are tro@@ tted out : supply @-@ side side economic policies , liberalisation , reduction of government debt and wage restraint on the part of employees in pay negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , I do not doubt that the topic of climate change will occupy us for a long time to come and there is going to be a long tim@@ el@@ ag between any action taken and the actual effect of turning climate change round .
However , at the same time , it is important to note that this situation has shown us that we have not made as much progress in Europe as we should have done .
We do not agree , however , Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , when it comes to the great big package that the Council has come up with in order to further limit the opening up of networks .
I am sure that this is perfectly understandable in principle , but it always ends up being about questions of detail .
Climate change is important too , of course .
As welcome as the individual measures are , they need to be structured as a whole and clear priorities need to be set for our policy .
We all know that politics are a question not just of the right objectives but of how they can best be achieved .
So it is obvious how important this investment is for the European Union and that is why we are being called on here to set the priorities quickly .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , we have here before us a great many ideas on social policy , for which I thank Mrs Lynne .
The Commission tabled a comprehensive proposal to make this desire a reality .
That is why your report &amp; apos ; s proposals are an urgent necessity .
Europeans should be seen unreservedly offering solidarity and cooperation in response to this terrorist attack , and the European partners should refrain from imposing conditions .
That is the key point : disaster management must be organised on a decentralised basis .
in writing . - I voted for the postponement of the discharge .
There are numerous other issues too .
We should hold our principle of equal opportunity up to the light of truth .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the adoption of this report because I believe that , as such , the compromise that Mr D@@ ess has drawn up is a good one and it demonstrates a great deal of sensitivity in relation to the situation of Europe &amp; apos ; s farmers .
Our resolution is intended to further democracy in Taiwan , but the People &amp; apos ; s Republic of China is taking it as an affront .
Nonetheless , much of what we have experienced in recent years is a consequence of climate change , and we will have to become acc@@ lima@@ tised to much more than what we are experiencing now .
I do believe that the Commission has produced a thoroughly good draft , which I am sure we have improved , because Parliament always does everything better .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I find it difficult to talk about the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s budget today without referring to the striking confirmation in the most recent report from the Court of Auditors on the reim@@ bur@@ s@@ ements and allowances which we receive as Members of the European Parliament .
We have already mentioned the human rights issue .
We therefore believe that Parliament &amp; apos ; s amendment offers an appropriate way of resolving this problem .
The fact of the matter is that the European Commission and the ECB have presented us with reports .
There is now an improved international framework for preventing violence against women in conflict regions and several countries have also adopted national action plans .
The Spanish presidency is , unfortunately , rather hesitant , but , Commissioner , Parliament supports you with all the commitment it can muster .
This is undoubtedly due to the European Union &amp; apos ; s efforts and the Roadmap which it produced together with its Quartet partners , the USA , Russia and the United Nations .
Mr President , Mr Ne@@ wen@@ s , the European Union is greatly interested in improving transatlantic relations and especially in foreign policy cooperation , and differences in opinion on Cuba should not impair the effectiveness of these . The EU &amp; apos ; s policy here consists of two main features .
We will also be unable to convince the budgetary authorities of the need to make as much as EUR 150 million in additional funding available via the flexibility instrument to alleviate the crisis in the white fish sector if no such demands are forthcoming from the Member States .
However , at the same time we have also recognised the special role which broadcasting plays in guaranteeing free opinion forming in our democratic society .
This brings me to my first point , namely the urgent need for an overview of the measures that have been taken to date by the nation states .
The new Member States are bringing us this competition .
Mr President , I am an enthusiastic pro @-@ European European and advocate of a European constitution as well as the Treaty of Lisbon .
Some Member States already have extremely good regulations , which could even be weakened by this Directive .
We always listen when your group chairman speaks , and that is good democratic practice .
Madam President , Commissioner , there are two issues arising from Mr Mulder &amp; apos ; s super@@ b report that I would like to briefly address .
There is absolutely no doubt about the fact we want it , but Parliament &amp; quot ; s right of codecision must be safeguarded if we do .
Certainly , the European Union &amp; apos ; s existing VAT Directive allows the application of a lower rate of VAT on energy but not a higher one .
We also need a European protein plan which will promote the cultivation of protein and le@@ gu@@ min@@ ous crops and reduce the dependency of the dairy sector with regard to this strategic type of feed .
Whether the reform package and reform laws will actually be implemented in practice remains to be seen .
We will have sufficient time to do so in this House .
I shall ensure that due consideration is given in this assessment to the importance that your House attaches to these activities .
That is why we need this process ; although we must waste no time in getting on with it , we need sensitivity , we need time , and we need to be present .
I believe we shall have to discuss this further in the course of the ad hoc procedure .
One must indeed point out that this report belongs in a greater context .
As a community of values , we have a common view of the situation with regard to the rule of law and human rights in Russia and we should say so .
I should also like to make the basic comment that this compromise , in particular , fails to meet the general demand for less bureaucracy , more transparency and more democracy ; on the contrary , it is completely wide of the mark .
I want to answer this very openly .
We Europeans can play a role in this with ST@@ AR@@ T , with the N@@ PT , which needs to be ren@@ egoti@@ ated , and particularly with the CF@@ E Treaty , which is of particular importance in Europe as we also have certain problems with Russia .
There is massive need in this area , and the Commission must get a move on .
After all , it is exciting ideas that lie behind at the birth of social change .
This document will also provide information on good and in some cases not so good collection practice in the Member States .
However , it is precisely the competitiveness of energy @-@ intensive intensive end products , such as steel , cement , al@@ umin@@ ium and others , which is at stake here , and it is also from the point of view of competition from third countries that uniform rules should be adopted in the EU , as advocated by the Commission .
We need you to explain this .
There are also Member States who want it .
To that extent , it is certainly important that we ensure that everyone , even the poor and the poorest of the poor , gets what they have a right to .
Let me conclude by reiterating my warm welcome , and that of my group , for this paper .
I therefore gladly voted in favour of this report , and I believe that we should emphasise two points in particular : firstly , we want the Council and the Commission to tell us this year when accession negotiations are to begin and , secondly , we will not tolerate any bilateral trou@@ ble@@ making , and definitely not with regard to this bi@@ zar@@ re name issue .
A dedicated department , a dedicated Directorate @-@ General General for peace @-@ building building within the External Action Service , would be the order of the day .
We are also very grateful to those Latin American states that have given remarkable support in reaching the decision on the establishment of a Human Rights Council .
It is not micro@@ management that we want to introduce , but we have made a political evaluation , which you have agreed .
Mr President , I believe it is very important that the European Parliament deals with the issue of Albania .
I would also like to give special thanks , on behalf of my colleague Mrs Niebler - who unfortunately cannot be here today , to the rapporteurs , Mrs del Castillo Vera , Mr Harbour and Mrs Trautmann , as well as to all the other people who have helped to pave the way for a compromise .
My question to the Commission is therefore - Mr Hahn , perhaps you could also pass this on to Mr Kallas - what , in specific terms , are we planning ?
. Madam President , I would simply like to say that , in the interests of consistency , the same wording should also be used in Paragraph 7 .
The creation of a new COM is also to be rejected at a time when there is general discussion about reforming the common agricultural policy away from market regulation and in the direction of a multifunctional approach for the future , and Agenda 2000 is about to be reviewed .
Mr President , thank you for your willingness to allow us this pleasure late in the evening .
When I was a newly elected Member , I had the privilege of hearing the speech made here by the French President Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Mit@@ ter@@ and in his role as President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council .
Let us implement stage 1 before starting stage 2 , because I have my doubts as to whether the ex@@ propri@@ ation or nation@@ alisation of networks is the right solution .
If it is about what the honourable member said earlier , I shall gladly give you the floor afterwards so that you can make a personal statement .
Are there also plans for technical mechanisms to fil@@ ter harmful content out of the Internet in future ?
Mr President , our group will also be supporting Mr Fernández Martín &amp; apos ; s excellent report .
The Council does not doubt that the governing body of the Bank will shortly submit a proposal to their board of govern@@ ors for a decision in accordance with the inter @-@ institutional institutional agreement . &amp; quot ;
At the same time , at present there is still some hope of working towards a solution based on a political settlement - and we encourage both sides to do so - under the United Nations process .
I am sure that we will be able , by the end of the year , to present a sound Budget .
Although we already have a large number of official bodies , he is obviously thinking of a way to strengthen the control of the Member States &amp; apos ; authorities in this area .
Secondly , I am convinced that if the intergovernmental conference were brought forward to 2003 , as the European Parliament has proposed , this would be seen as an attempt to escape the people &amp; apos ; s vote .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Mr Gloser , Commissioner , let me begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur , Ro@@ di K@@ rats@@ a @-@ Tsagaropoulou Tsagaropoulou , for her report .
rapporteur . - Mr President , my fellow Members will perhaps understand that , after the European Parliament rejected this agreement in February , it is now necessary to make it clear that in the meantime , working with the Commission , we have managed to make a noticeable improvement to the text .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it has to be said that the European Commission &amp; apos ; s current strategy for bringing about the actual realisation and improvement of the internal market has already been the subject of debate in this House on quite a number of occasions .
Naturally , my Committee has examined this issue and concludes that the right legal basis has been selected and that the concerns regarding the proposal &amp; apos ; s legality are un@@ founded .
As you know , Turkey has decided in favour of Europe and is ready to undertake its obligations under the Treaty of Amsterdam .
If it relates to that , then - and I asked to speak before the final vote - we in this House are not even competent , prior to the Amsterdam intergovernmental conference , to take the kind of decision we have taken .
That is what we expect from the negotiations over the coming weeks .
These exemption regulations guarantee that the directive will not infringe the rights of third parties .
Do we have rules to prevent the European Union and Turkey from being at log@@ ger@@ heads ?
Madam President , before the vote on the legislative resolution , I should like to ask the Commissioner , on behalf of our group , to tell us his position regarding which amendments he will accept , so that we can then ask for referral to committee if necessary .
When the WTO negotiations take place in Canc@@ un in the autumn we need to ask ourselves : to what extent has world trade been liberalised ?
If the new treaty is not implemented , the Treaty of Nice and the accession treaties will remain in force , which means that all countries will have fewer seats .
Commissioner , you quite rightly referred several times to the support which Parliament has offered up to now in its contacts with the relevant departments .
It is my wish that the European Union will continue to speak with one voice at the forthcoming international gather@@ ings , and I consider it utterly futile to spend our time now apportioning blame to individual ministers .
The European Union and its security strategy would , I think , have been important enough , without being made to be that sort of initiative .
So it is important that we create links between transport policy and other policies .
I would ask that we be given the opportunity to see him even before the committee meeting in June , because he will be in demand over the next few weeks and , I fear , will be misused by some people .
The case against her does not appear to be in accord with the principles of the presu@@ mption of inno@@ c@@ ence and the right to defence counsel .
That is why I welcome the fact , Commissioner , that the Commission is making this issue such a high priority .
Thirdly , we welcome the co @-@ legislator legislator role of the European Parliament and therefore also welcome the intention of concluding a transitional agreement .
The second fact is that alternatives of various kinds are in the process of development .
The Member States , too , must discharge their responsibilities in connection with the administration and control of much of the EU &amp; quot ; s Budget .
I must now , before the debate , quite sincerely ask the new Commission to take this first opportunity it has had to express its opinion on what Parliament has said on this matter .
The public will be able to touch the euro and that is why confidence in the euro will grow from that moment on .
We now hope that this afternoon &amp; apos ; s Conference of Presidents will recommend the establishment of a committee of inquiry and that Parliament will be able to vote on it tomorrow and institute the committee in due form .
I therefore say : this Parliament is there to ensure that the climate in Europe remains against the death penalty .
As you will have infer@@ red from what I have said , the Commission rejects the first option .
The committee was divided on whether we should reject the whole proposal or accept it as modified by the amendments submitted by Mr Karlsson .
I am therefore very grateful that Members have followed me on points 4 and 5 , in which we asked the Albanians , before the Commission resu@@ mes negotiations with them , to at least comply with all the requirements of the OSCE / ODIHR election observers &amp; apos ; committee , allowing that committee to begin its work in the parliament , checking that new electoral legislation is also set in motion and that the political forces should give some consideration to who , in Albania , can lead that country in such a way as to unite it .
Your White Paper is a contribution to that added value , Mr Prodi .
Agricultural statistics , for example , still take insufficient account of the work done by farmers &amp; quot ; wi@@ ves .
Firstly - I would not wish to deny this - Turkey is a key economic factor .
This too is important if we want to ensure that sustainability is not just dead letter .
It was difficult , and it was not clear at the very beginning that we would make it and that we would have greater Europeanisation in this area .
That is what the European Union &amp; apos ; s main task must be , rather than the sending of European troops , which is what I have heard advocated by not a few representatives of this Union of ours over the past few days .
Or is it not rather this weak , a@@ iling , ir@@ resolute Europe that has by no means overcome nationalism ; the Europe of state chanc@@ ell@@ eries ; the Europe of closed doors ; the in@@ decisive , a@@ social Europe ; the Europe with the severe democratic deficit ?
These are the views we share , and in these respects the report can be strongly endorsed .
It is true that we are probably now in a decisive stage of relations between the European Union and Turkey .
Al@@ as , the domestic political crises in both nations have brought a renewed har@@ den@@ ing and we , the European Parliament , are working very hard to get the situation moving again .
In other words , measures which primarily affect agriculture must be financed from this fund , whereas measures that affect rural areas without having any link at all with agriculture and the multi@@ functionality of rural areas should actually be supported within the framework of regional policy .
I cannot understand the assertion that this cannot have been discussed in the committee .
I want to thank the shadow rapporteur , Pi@@ lar del Castillo Vera , who has done great work .
Amendments 7 , 17 and 18 clarify this . In these , we make it clear that the real object of our efforts is the use of adult stem cells in research and in the treatment of patients , but , from a purely scientific point of view it appears that we need embryo stem cell research simply to further develop research with adult stem cells .
The honourable Member can rest assured that we shall continue to work towards this objective with great commitment .
The European Parliament must re@@ define the cohesion policy for the future to meet the needs of the European regions .
The Commission has suggested a communication initiative in order to improve this situation .
Nor is the funding of growth @-@ promoting promoting investments any more adequate , and we should also be including in the broad economic policy guidelines coordinating measures to combat unfair tax competition and tax evasion .
If it is not , we shall never be finished with this matter and I will probably be affected by this personally in the 1998 budgetary procedure .
The reform of agricultural policy , the structural funds , and the financing of the enlargement , will all show one thing very quickly : that the enlargement does not come at zero cost .
We advocate an Israeli state within secure borders , but we also want a Palestinian state within secure borders .
We must , though , take steps to deal with the constant increase in unemployment .
But that also means that we in the European Parliament must responsibly create the right conditions .
Parliament should not lend this political manoeuv@@ ring by the Council the appearance of success through its consent in the conciliation committee .
Thirdly , the UN &amp; quot ; s environmental programmes need to be transformed into a real UN environmental organisation , one that is sustainable and well organised .
Madam President , Commissioner , even as one who is well aware of the reservations about introducing single judge decisions by the Court of First In@@ stance put forward during the discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &amp; apos ; Rights , and has now heard them repeated , let me on behalf of my group plead for adoption of the Martin report , now that the Committee on Institutional Affairs has decided to do so too .
Does the Council Presidency share the vision of further developing Frontex and the battle groups into a real European border service for the common protection of our external borders ?
We know that nearly all the forces in Belarus are in favour of the partnership and cooperation agreement and of the interim agreement with the European Union , with a view to obtaining a stable contractual framework for their economic activity and their general relations with the European Union .
As has already been said several times over , the existing constitutional - or rather institutional - framework is not up to the job .
A coherent strategy to combat climate change is therefore desirable .
What , then , is this debate about ?
If this is done in the right way , Moldova too will soon be moving towards democracy , as well as - I hope in the next few years - Belarus .
Transparency , a uniform quality standard and the presentation of the advantages and disadvantages of a sufficient number of political options are the key to reliable impact assessments . For this reason , I voted in favour of the alternative proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance .
I think that further dialogue is needed .
That is a huge step forward , because it means that the right of initiative of this Parliament , which unfortunately does not exist , will be secured by indirect means .
Mr President , Mrs S@@ call@@ on , all funds from the European Budget are spent in accordance with the Treaty bases .
It is also up to us to provide the necessary knowledge , awareness and , of course , the necessary resources for prevention and treatment .
Yes , we need the action plan for financial services and stability .
I am very grateful for the excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency .
So it is even more important to manage the crisis in a rational way , but also to adopt a course which leads to our desired goals : namely to combine agricultural policy goals with consumer protection , animal welfare , and environmental protection objectives .
We hope that the Council will now adopt our suggestions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the Commission , we all hoped that another urgent debate on the political situation in Belarus would not be necessary .
That being so , I wish to make it very clear that if the Commission fails to deliver a substantive response on this issue within the stipulated time limit , I shall propose to the Committee on Legal Affairs that we take proceedings against it in the European Court for failure to act .
Members of Parliament should be able to speak on important matters when the occasion arises .
There is a problem in this connection , namely that the title of the agreement , which we wish to support in Parliament , is rather long .
In view of the crisis , it is particularly important that the European Union be given these powers .
Europe must speak with a single voice here - something which it failed to do in Singapore .
To enable competition to take place on equal terms , including the financial conditions , the Commission must therefore make it clear that the funding of public service broadcasting through fees paid by the users and / or some form of mixed financing does not contraven@@ e the aid provisions of the Treaty .
Like the rest of the international community , we still regard the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the representative of the whole of Cyprus , as its only legitimate representative under international law .
The third point , which I think needs very special emphasis , is that we must export security to the applicant Central and Eastern European countries that are seeking to join the European Union .
The Commission is right if it thinks that a range of difficult issues remain to be resolved , and we can be grateful to the Presidency of the Council for coming up with a number of proposals on them .
Mr President , on behalf of our Group I would like to request referral back to the Committee in accordance with Article 16@@ 8 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
I just wanted to point out that it might have been a good thing to draw attention to this again in the report .
Mr President , necessary though it is to enact measures to combat climate change and promote renewables , it is extremely important that Parliament should also deal with the future of conventional energy sources .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mrs Jackson , we shall be tabling a cross @-@ party party amendment that attracted majority support in this House at first reading .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am the rapporteur for the so @-@ called called remaining sections of the Budget .
I refer to the country @-@ of of @-@ origin origin principle .
That is why I also say , as far as we are concerned : consultation after the European elections , absolutely , but only once the European Parliament has been convened .
I am convinced that with the EU &amp; quot ; s support the country &amp; quot ; s dynamism , which is seen especially in T@@ all@@ inn , will also accelerate economic and social development in other , more remote parts .
However , when one of the fundamental principles of European democracy is put at risk , you sit and do nothing .
For this reason I make an urgent appeal to the Council to reconsider its decision and finally adopt the revised version .
When I look at the Council &amp; apos ; s proposal , I assume that people will ask themselves this : how can the EU introduce an assessment regime that exclu@@ des the plans and projects financed by the European Union itself ?
The existing regulations on the shi@@ pment of toxic waste to developing countries must be tightened up and enforced .
I would like to encourage the Commission to put forward a new proposal within the framework laid down by the Council , and would ask them to prevent the impression being created that we , by re@@ interpreting or even by amending the law , are pursuing a new European deficit management policy for which we will all have to pay de@@ arly .
I would sum this up by saying that our concessions to the developing countries played a part in making the European Union , today , far and away the most important importer of agricultural produce from developing countries .
With this in mind , how do you rate the chances for survival of our own energy @-@ intensive intensive industries , and what effect do you think this will have on Russia &amp; apos ; s accession to the WTO ?
Too little attention is paid to that , and we shall press hard for this demand from Parliament to be met .
That is why I believe that we have made enormous strides .
Therefore , we must insist that not only the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague , but also the local war @-@ crimes crimes tri@@ bunals in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina Herzegovina , be able to do their jobs properly .
In that respect Europe must distinguish itself from other players in the region .
The Commission has some urgent re@@ working to do here .
In addition to dialogue and partnership between the stakeholders , such as the national parliaments , the local and regional authorities and the social partners , and increased coordination , there is a need for the existing regulations to be simplified and implemented more efficiently by the Member States .
However , I can accept your proposal to incorporate additional criteria for trig@@ gering the measure in the Council text , particularly those on market prices .
The focus is quite clear .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to take the opportunity to make two basic points .
Ultimately , this is producing truly dramatic consequences for consumers throughout the world because food prices among others have also shot up as a result .
During those one @-@ minute minute speeches there was an incident .
In this respect , the European works council has promoted a European awareness out@@ stand@@ ingly well and has further@@ ed the interest of employees in transnational measures and in acts of solidarity in exactly the same way .
This leads me to believe that your proposal must be sent back , thus giving you the chance to present a new and revised one .
Here I take a quite different view from Mrs Heinisch .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , this debate cris@@ s @-@ crosses crosses the Directives .
Nothing happening at the present time would justify such a for@@ ceful political response , and so I must ask you , as a matter of the greatest urgency , to endorse the amendment I have tabled and vote for its adoption .
However , the European Parliament also has its part to play now and must carry on the work in precisely this area , which involves strengthening the EU institutions and consolidating the democratic structures of Europe .
If we look at the example of freedom of speech and opinion , it is true that there is a lively debate taking place on a number of topics which were previously taboo , including the rights of minorities and sexual minorities , Mr Cashman .
I very much hope that we can use the experience which we gathered during the first phase of the eastern enlargement of the EU to help it in this process .
Secondly , we need a decision to make the Charter an integral part of the Treaties .
. Mr President , it is now my privilege to speak on behalf of my group and to have the opportunity to respond to a number of the points which have been made .
This must be guaranteed .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is not the first time the European Parliament has concerned itself with the question of how we should play our part long term in the marked reduction of trace gases relevant to climatic change , in order to achieve a real alteration in climate .
I said before the European Council that we really needed to reinforce the European Union &amp; apos ; s capacity to act .
My sincere congratulations go to the rapporteur , Michel Rocard .
For this reason , we absolutely reject a third reading and will be voting against all the amendments which would result in this .
Let me thank the Court of Auditors , you , Mr Karlsson and the Court &amp; apos ; s members and staff for the 2000 Report and give especial additional thanks for the special reports , whose very practical recommendations make them very valuable to the Commission in its work .
Firstly , I should be happ@@ ier if those Members who delivered imp@@ as@@ sion@@ ed speeches for the whole world to hear would at least stay in the chamber for the rest of the debate .
In my opinion , trade agreements are a good thing if they promote general prosperity on both sides , but not when they serve the interests of a few large multinational companies almost exclusively .
I ask for your support in this .
We are reaching the limits of the current structures .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as rapporteur for Estonia I am pleased to be able to recommend that this House should today vote in favour of Estonia &amp; apos ; s accession to the European Union .
Do you believe that the WTO negotiations that are now being conducted under French chairmanship have any chance of reaching a satisfactory conclusion by December ?
The Treaty on European Union tells us .
I will therefore only focus on a few specific aspects here .
in writing . - I voted against Mr Davies &amp; apos ; report on the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light @-@ commercial commercial vehicles .
In the area of services , which , above all for European suppliers , is the largest growth market , market access should be improved and new areas should be included , concerning which the European Parliament should certainly be clearly heard .
In order to achieve this , we need an EU regulator who has joint powers with the national regulators and who is entitled to dis@@ connec@@ t from the grid any power stations which fail to meet these standards .
This criticism must be permitted in a democratic structure .
I might add that the time for discussing my proposal has been and gone .
That is why I voted in favour of the present resolution .
With an average inflation rate of 0.@@ 8 % in Euroland at the present time , we have price stability .
There is indeed a need for respect in Europe , not just respect for the great , but for great and small alike .
I am convinced that the new approach will , in any case , lead to an improvement in food safety in the EU .
Human rights must apply to all , whether or not they are the focus of particular international attention at that time .
The European Commission has clear objectives for its action plan on freight transport , which it wants to introduce soon .
We have economic interests .
In accordance with this legal basis , OLAF was set up as an office which administra@@ tively speaking is part of the Commission , that is to say OLAF &amp; apos ; s staff are Commission officials and are subject to its statute .
Allow me to begin with the aspect of safety , which was the most important element in this project .
That is another reason why we have had to come back to the same question twice in the space of about a year .
We must manage to ensure that a critical mass of minority @-@ group group refugees return , so that this becomes an irreversible process .
We have assumed that the need to increase the involvement of women in the projects financed will actually be taken into account , although it has to be said that Russia is not exactly at the bottom of the class in this area .
The present situation is unsatisfactory .
It is up to us Europeans to accompany and support our partners in this process .
What I found lacking in the debate is a reference to the fact that the European Council will set in motion a process in the course of which we must find the answers to three questions .
Mr President , I should like to begin by compli@@ menting Mrs Fontaine on her di@@ li@@ gence and care in drawing up this document , and on her cooperative spirit , which has ultimately led to an excellent result .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Madam Commissioner , Commissioners , my group welcomes the discussion on the measures required at European level to cope with the un@@ parallel@@ ed damage w@@ rought by the disastrous floods in the Federal Republic of Germany , in Austria , in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia .
This is a decision that will carry weight both in the Council and in the Commission .
Mr President of the Commission , for the sake of the euro &amp; apos ; s success , withdraw your statement !
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition .
What is clear is that the most important features of the Posting of Workers Directive function only to a limited extent - I am talking here not only about the imposition of administrative penalties across borders , but also about the cooperation between authorities .
In the interests of burden sharing in Europe and with a view to the credibility of the continued existence of the Transatlantic Alliance , we must develop the relevant capabilities ourselves .
In June of last year , we - the EU and the USA - drew up a joint declaration on combating terrorism which states that the war on terror must be in accord with the fundamental values and the principle of the rule of law .
For example , people allegedly responsible for torture will be brought to trial .
We must use the funds entrusted to us more efficiently and more carefully , if we also wish to co @-@ finance finance enlargement .
I therefore appeal to the Member States to ensure that the instruments we are adopting here , as well as the market @-@ surveillance surveillance mechanisms that already exist for the safety of consumers , are really put into practice .
However , in my opinion , sustainability is a principle that ought not solely to take account of environmental considerations , rather it is equally important to make economic and social considerations part of the concept .
Mr President , I find this absolutely scandalous , and I think we should be speaking a clearer language here than we have done so far .
I deeply regret this and think that it will have consequences for our relations with these States .
You say that you will submit your draft directive immediately afterwards ; in that case , it is likely to be autumn 2004 and that leaves a relatively tight timeframe for debates in Parliament and with the Council and a very tight timeframe for a preparatory phase for businesses before it enters into force at the end of 2006 .
I think it absolutely vital that those concerned are involved in the harmonization process .
Turning now to the proposed amendments , let me say briefly that the Commission approves the inser@@ tion of the extra recital .
The EU Commission &amp; apos ; s Task Force is already working in the area itself .
We want to promote the emancip@@ ation of European political parties from the groups still further and open up future prospects for them and our main concern is to see European political parties become a major vehicle for European political work .
Only a real and serious engagement with the problems will be credible and effective in the long term .
Although most of those affected by the regulation and the directive are not exactly j@@ um@@ ping for joy , an absolute majority of them have expressed their support for the adoption of these two dossiers , and my vote will reflect that .
Taking a long @-@ term term perspective from your ten years of experience in European politics , do you think that we will ever reach the stage in terms of transparency that Sweden reached decades ago ?
Of course we need investment in education , training , research and technical innovation .
The Council cannot take the initiative to discuss a report by an Irish authority or to take a position when the report has not even been submitted to it .
I also believe that it is important for us consistently to consider inflation , def@@ lation and how they are defined , especially in view of the risk of def@@ lation .
Tomorrow we will begin the trilogue , that is to say , the actual negotiations .
The way in which these two problems have become so serious and so widespread in our time is also a result of the globalisation process .
in writing . - I am voting in favour of the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system .
I welcome the proposal that the Commission should produce a study on the liability issue by the end of 2006 , and I agree with what Mr Schwab had to say about this .
One thing is quite right : we must inform consumers , and here I am in agreement with Mrs Thyssen and everyone else .
Thirdly , in the international legal framework , the European Union has continued to press for a key role to be given to the United Nations in the combating of terrorism .
Then we shall see how this Parliament and its Members will vote : as friends of the citizens and the environment or the way the noise and exhaust lobby wants .
This could lead to new proposals , which would then form the basis of the Sixth Commission Report on Citi@@ zenship of the Union , which is scheduled for 2010 .
It is clear that we as Europeans and as parliamentarians expect the social market economy to be turned into a reality .
Many are looking towards Tampere with great hopes and are expecting considerable steps towards a Europe for the citizens .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the destiny of Europe is at stake .
Food safety is the watch@@ word of the moment , perhaps even the concept of the year .
In my official capacity I should like to express my thanks to her for the excellent work which she has undertaken in cooperation with other members of this House .
Thirdly , it is Turkey &amp; apos ; s responsibility to ensure that this process is not obstructed and , at last , to keep the promises that it has made in the context of the Ankara Protocol , for example .
He wrote a remarkable article in the &amp; apos ; New York Tim@@ es &amp; apos ; a few days ago .
D@@ ual pricing also requires a legal framework , a regulation .
I just wanted to add that point .
Mr President , I am not quite certain of this , but I do fear that you have not had paragraph 75 voted on .
This report is very important to me because it also contains an analysis , thus providing the basis for conclusions for the next two support periods .
This is an excellent report and it was a pleasure to work with you .
The peace talks are making no headway , as we saw at the most recent OSCE summit .
One of the reasons why the Lisbon Strategy was unable to achieve its goals was the poor integration of the cities and regions .
We can debate it as we wish but there has to be some guarantee that farmers do not derive their incomes solely or substantially from compensation but that they can participate in the market more than before .
All things considered , the PPE Group supports this report in the amended form produced by the Legal Affairs Committee .
I hope that with this resolution we give a clear answer .
I read the latest draft resolution with great interest and warmly welcome the persua@@ sive proposals it contains .
Not one country can , relying on itself alone , win the war against terrorism and international crime .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , no one in this House disputes that close cooperation between the Member States is very important and necessary for countering terrorist risks .
I welcome the invitation extended to the freely elected President of Serbia , Mr Kost@@ uni@@ ca , and I would expressly like to thank the French President , Jacques Chirac , for this invitation , because it signalled that we Europeans are on the side of a democratic Serbia which is developing in the right direction , and that the newly elected President has the support of the European Union .
We therefore have to be very vigilant in this period .
Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President President , ladies and gentlemen , many thanks on behalf of my Group !
We are further than ever from gener@@ alised qualified majority voting in the Council , which would have led to codecision rights for the European Parliament .
We need far more investment in research so that we can bring innovative solutions in all areas onto the market .
That is what distur@@ bs me about this report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me clarify matters very briefly .
We have already spoken about Indonesia , East Timor and Burma .
How , too , do you propose to carry on a debate about nuclear issues in Austria and Europe when Mr Barroso has deleted any reference to &amp; apos ; risk &amp; quot ; as regards the atom from the Green Paper ?
It must say , &amp; apos ; We want you in the European Union as soon as possible , but we cannot offer an alternative to your reform process . You yourselves will have to pursue it , and you will have to apply a pro @-@ European European strategy . &amp; apos ;
This also applies to protection against counterfeit medicines .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is extremely grateful for the opportunity to be able to say something today about the situation regarding women &amp; apos ; s rights in Saudi Arabia .
It gives people from non @-@ EU EU countries the chance to live in and with their families in the European Union while also avoiding a drastic increase in the level of immigration into our Member States .
As we understand it , we need to decide here whether we want a resolution .
Above all , children are in danger of setting off un@@ explo@@ ded devices by accident , and they can receive serious injuries from doing so .
Of course , Parliament often points the way ahead and some people - yourself excluded perhaps - then go down that road rather hesit@@ antly .
We have ourselves proposed areas in which we can withdraw legislation and in which we do not regard European regulation as necessary , yet the Commission has not responded to our proposals .
Madam President , yesterday we decided - and this is also recorded in the Minutes - to hold a debate on Thursday on developments in the Middle East .
The EUR 2 4@@ 05 6@@ 71 mobil@@ ised from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will fund a coordinated package of person@@ alised services , which will be supplemented by national measures and measures taken by the company .
But we cannot achieve that through votes or such@@ like .
And nobody here should con@@ sole themselves with the thought that tomorrow we shall take a decision and then the matter will be removed from the table .
The copyright laws , the laws of public reproduction of material , the laws on publicity , the laws on protection of privacy , technical identification and protection systems , and also laws on the limitation of arrest need to be discussed and resolved .
The guiding principle is that , to the extent that the situation returns to normal , keeping these measures in place for longer than required risks changing the behaviour of financial market participants in an undesirable manner , and we do not wish to bre@@ ed dependency .
We therefore need to ensure that these safety standards are improved .
Some other Members have touched on it , and I will say it again quite clearly : there must never again be accession treaties without the accession conditions being fulfilled in their entirety .
We are well aware of our responsibility , and we will not allow anyone to undermine our determination to keep on working on the labour of peace that is the integration of Europe .
This also requires us - and here I have a request to make of you - to pursue a policy of stability , to fight inflation , to cut the public debt and , above all , to create the conditions to make investment in Europe worthwhile .
Rühle report ( A5 @-@ 010@@ 9 010@@ 9 / 2001 )
Another point is the debate on ar@@ tis@@ an@@ al fisheries and fisheries which use very large , very efficient ships .
President Chirac &amp; apos ; s praise this morning with respect to the budgetary and supervisory function of the European Parliament emphasised this yet again .
The text contains a recital detail@@ ing the situation of the Roma in Europe , in which Parliament draws attention to the pre@@ valence of anti @-@ Roma Roma s@@ enti@@ ment and its discriminatory effect on the opportunities in terms of employment , education and social services for the European Union &amp; apos ; s most disadvantaged ethnic @-@ minority minority group .
We have now reached a good compromise , and should support it .
Renewable energy , which is growing in our la@@ ti@@ tudes , is a secure source that is available to us at all times .
At the summit , both sides stressed their mutual dependency where energy was concerned and emphasised that the EU and Russia had to define their relations in this crucial area by mutual agreement .
I should like on behalf of all of you to state that this should not affect the work of the Czech Presidency and that we must have the will to ensure that work continues .
In particular , consumers must be protected against the obvious abuses of power on the part of the large operators .
We must be clear in our own minds about the fact that there are those in this House who seek to use enlargement to w@@ rec@@ k the European Union .
We want mobility and freedom of movement for people and we have considered how we can ensure that .
We also welcome the fact that the agricultural subsidies available to the new Member States are to be increased to reach the level of 100 % of direct aid by 2013 .
It will be an interesting balancing act to see how this will be resolved .
We will have problems with their constitutions ; I can say that in the case of Germany , and I am sure that most of the Member States will find further obstacles in terms of their constitutional law when it comes to implementing this agreement , and so it is in the individual Member States that the necessary conditions must be put in place first of all .
I find it hard to believe that the Council could not accept this too .
We realise that these coordination procedures exist , and as a European politician I would actually be pleased if some people - people in positions of responsibility , politicians - would coordinate their activities .
I cannot understand why it is still the case that the Council is sitting at the table as an observer in the negotiations , Parliament is not involved and the documents are not publicly accessible .
Yet we as Parliament and the EU as a whole also bear a responsibility here .
Parliament is not even accorded the right to send two representatives to its Board of Management .
Mr President , Commissioner , it seems that , once again , the Commission is merely paying lip service to the idea of a social Europe .
Europe , as we know , has benefited greatly from international trade .
This is especially important for us at this point .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , whenever we in this House simultaneously talk about the Europe of free movement and the Europe of diversity , it is rather like trying to squ@@ are the circle . At the very least it is an extremely difficult con@@ und@@ rum to solve , and the solution varies from case to case .
Therefore I hope that this Intergovernmental Conference will use the opportunity to at last restore the balance between the two institutions , Parliament and the Council that is , and to give Parliament more powers .
The Arctic is not only a concern with regard to the climate , it also involves something of a potential for conflict .
These are ambitious objectives , and , if they are to be achieved in little more than a decade , all the interested parties will have to make a joint effort .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , as the previous speaker has just shown , in the European Parliament we are still far from reaching a unanimous view on global warming .
In this respect the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia without a UN mandate represents the most criminal violation of this principle .
Unfortunately , this report does not reflect this position .
The EU &amp; apos ; s Association Agreement with Central America , which is due to be concluded before the end of this year , already shows , in its present form , that the EU is mainly interested in market liberalisation and deregulation .
How can we mobilise private capital and public funds and persuade the banks to play a more active part in this field ?
Our sincere thanks go to them .
The European Parliament has shown the way in this respect .
Thus , we need a system of functional , interlinked supervisory rules and practices in the EU .
Now the elections have taken place we want to see some changes .
Mr President , if my oral amendment is accepted , we do not need a split vote .
We are treating this as an urgent matter .
It must contribute towards developing a type of administrative interdependence for inter@@ dependent national economies , and it must also contribute to a global concept of economic management .
However , please note that we also do not want an independent European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
Therefore , the Commission undertook to present a report on the functioning of the Interinstitutional Agreement at the end of 2009 .
Mr President , I have a question concerning how events will run in practice .
There is also the human @-@ rights rights issue .
Once Europe has w@@ rested authority over these areas from the national Parliaments , there will be a need for democratic supervision here too , and the same goes for the common foreign and security policy .
Moreover , I consider it a disadvantage for the future new Member States from central and eastern Europe if we continue to subsidi@@ ze countries not involved in monetary union while at the same time the new Member States fail to enjoy this cohesion fund .
Surely it is more than a mere linguistic nu@@ ance to say that the efforts at rectifying abuses of this sort must not just be persever@@ ed with , but also significantly stepped up .
Safety standards will be harmonised and monitored in future by the European Railway Agency .
Parliament has made pain@@ sta@@ king efforts to discuss the Commission &amp; quot ; s proposals on the budget headings under chapter A @-@ 30 30 , which have been on the table since May .
Perhaps I may just add a brief comment regarding a point that was mentioned earlier , namely the different access rights granted to Eurojust and Europol .
There will be more in the motion that we are due to vote on tomorrow .
Mr Vice @-@ President President , you are a gentleman , but let us get to the crux of the matter : the Member States are not doing their homework .
Mr President , I apologise for taking the floor once again , but I believe that some confusion has arisen , because my fellow Members are not currently discussing my report , but the report on social responsibility , which will be debated later .
At the same time , Member States &amp; apos ; responsibility for processing visa applications is clarified .
Nice must deliver a substantial reform of the institutions of the European Union .
The Committee wishes this categor@@ isation to be effec@@ ted as soon as possible , as I have already stated .
Of course Europe has an identity and borders .
As the Commissioner said , one of the reasons why this revision was necessary was because earlier directives did not go far enough . Further reasons included the need to improve the necessary legal certainty , to define the scope in more detail and to safeguard the free movement of goods at the same time as ensuring a high level of health and safety protection for consumers .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Spanish Presidency &amp; apos ; s desire to make a particular mark and send a signal of solidarity and political rapprochement by holding the Latin American and Caribbean Summit in Madrid is something to be welcomed .
One cannot put a price on values such as these .
Mr President , I thank the rapporteur , the content of whose report is consistent with the position of our group .
I would particularly ask the rapporteur to take this into account and to support the position of the Committee on Women &amp; apos ; s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
However , I also believe that any directive should be assessed according to its efficiency , careful targeting , precision and sub@@ t@@ le@@ ty , so as to enable the Commission to carry out its supervisory function to optimum effect .
After all , a number of delegation members are present here .
If that is not discrimination , what is ?
For the sake of operational efficiency , I ask the House to support our Amendment 10 .
I also endorse the Austrian suggestion that an appropriate stance be adopted on this matter at the Dublin conference .
But I was keen to hear whether the Council could accept it , if that were perhaps possible .
What we absolutely must reject , though , is the expulsion of Georgi@@ ans from Russia ; Argu@@ ing along the lines of &amp; apos ; yes , but they &amp; apos ; re illeg@@ als &amp; apos ; has a cynical ring to it .
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission , who stood by with advice and expert help at all times .
I endorse the demands in the motion for a resolution , for Europol to be transferred to the first pillar and funded from the EU Budget , thus becoming subject to Parliament &amp; apos ; s full Budgetary control , and for the constitution to contain a legal basis for clear and utterly stringent data protection , with public access to documents not being able to be im@@ properly restricted .
After the publication of the judgment and until the compromise was reached , the Commission &amp; apos ; s position was certainly not a simple one .
That is when equality will become something we take for granted and when International Women &amp; apos ; s Day will be transformed from a day of re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance to a day to celebrate freedom .
Admittedly , we also know that this threat can no longer be fought by individual states because the challenge is international and runs across borders .
But the Court of Auditors is critici@@ zing the Commission and private organizations .
If accession talks are held with Slovenia , will the question of nuclear safety and final storage also be raised in those negotiations ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to make four points .
The TRIPS regulation also fails mis@@ er@@ ably to accommodate the resources in these countries , for under its terms they would have to pay de@@ arly again for their basic products , which will have been pat@@ ented by us beforehand .
And I am grateful because I think the Commission &amp; apos ; s statements have pointed to a constructive way forward here .
In other words , we must take great care .
What matters is that the Commission , with our help , is pressing on with the creation of the new ACP economic area .
The general opinion envisages not only a total ban on the advertising of tobacco products but also a total ban on indirect advertising , for example for Cam@@ el boo@@ ts or Davi@@ do@@ ff cosmetics .
Particularly helpful in this regard is the fact that we have a clear del@@ ine@@ ation of competences between national and European levels , and the early @-@ warning warning system for subsidiarity monitoring will also have a positive impact .
In a democratic legal system , the institutional and political independence of an institution is only possible if democratic legitim@@ isation is guaranteed at the same time , and that includes transparency of decisions and indeed the possibility of understanding these decisions .
At the moment , I am very uns@@ ure of how we can react in the light of the answer which you have given .
We know what the cause of this problem is .
Secondly , in those cases where states make use of the exemptions in relation to combined heat and power , we expect a report to Parliament so that that , too , can be discussed by it .
This 2004 Constitution must become a reality , as only then can progress result in increased democracy , transparency and efficiency in the European Union and hence for the people of Europe .
In the plenary session on Solv@@ ency II 14 days ago I said that it was important that Europe sent clear signals that were he@@ eded in the rest of the world .
Nonetheless , I agree with the honourable Member that we must pay very close attention to the burdens placed on the European tourism industry and ensure that framework conditions are put in place that allow this industry to capit@@ alise in real terms on the massive growth and employment potential that it has to offer .
I shall not , however , debate the matter any further with you now .
The second main message is that the euro provides benefits and protection .
SMEs need to tackle their technical changeover as quickly as possible , and in doing so also to give some thought to the strategic consequences of a market no@@ table for price transparency and increased competition .
I believe that it is crucial to convince the government of Southern Cyprus that the European Union must deliver on the promises it has made to the north of the island .
We must find an effective and manageable solution to that problem .
This consistent directive is an important step towards doing this .
The Committee debated them at several meetings and finally adopted them with one vote against .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we will all - institutions and politicians alike - have to review and resha@@ pe our communication strategies , priorities and working methods , but also our decision @-@ making making and opinion @-@ forming forming processes in the light of the European Union &amp; apos ; s enlargement to what will probably be more than 30 states - if we include the Balkan countries - but also in the light of the political challenges which are being set for us and which we are setting ourselves .
Yet the people of Mexico have high expectations of the new EU / Mexico relations , particularly where human rights are concerned .
The area could , by pi@@ lo@@ ting the implementation of economic structural reforms , influence the whole of north @-@ western western Russia and bind this cross @-@ border border region more closely with Europe .
It is high time that readmission arrangements were made a fixed element of agreements .
I am of the opinion that we need to think this through once again , to say nothing about the various possibilities for manip@@ ulating proportional representation .
The potential strength of this Union is a broad security partnership with those States that are not yet Members or that may never become Members .
The new legal framework for telecommunications regulation should guarantee some remedi@@ al action here .
Amendments Nos 7 , 11 and 14 call for greater involvement of the Commission and additional research .
Firstly , the Commission instructed an agency to take over the administration of the programme and to simplify the administration procedure even before this regulation was proposed .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to take up a position on this issue and propose to do so in seven stages .
I welcome the decision of the report to stand firmly on the side of small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises .
You need only consider the European internal market and economic and monetary union .
It is Parliament &amp; apos ; s duty as a supervisory body to investigate these possible abuses , to point out where mismanagement , irregul@@ arity and even fraud has occurred , and to call for appropriate action to be taken and to ensure that this is done .
Mr President , there is a drafting error in Paragraph 2 of this resolution .
Mr President , as rapporteur for Iran , I support the joint motion for a resolution .
We are moving over to policy making in a new context .
Our final positions must be established against the background of the overall negotiations .
If we want a future that offers sustainable development , employment and quality of life , we must work on our environment .
As you are aware , we do not yet know if a new WTO round will even start and , if so , to what extent .
Ac@@ tually the matter is quite simple .
I hope that we continue to address this issue as constructively as we have done in the Temporary Committee on Climate Change , although I am not certain that that will happen .
Whether that revised regime is compatible with the rules is something that same panel will decide again .
We need an intensive debate on this issue , and I believe that the time has now come for this to happen .
I can fully endorse what the previous speakers have said on that point .
I believe that a combination of both methods will ultimately lead to success in Europe .
For that , though , a primary requirement is for well @-@ organised organised and structured sharing of experience , with it being particularly necessary that we should promote to a far greater degree the process of learning from one another , whether by supporting European networks , setting in motion Europe @-@ wide wide studies and analyses or even by means of conferences .
An initiative plan was submitted in 2000 , but no further action was taken .
This really is an outstanding success , a result of her work of which you are entitled to be proud , and I warmly congratulate her on it .
If , as I would hope , we adopt my report here today and the Council reaches a decision along similar lines , the ball will be well and truly in the Turkish half of the pit@@ ch .
We need to break new ground if we are ever to achieve full employment and the sort of growth that will sustain such a level of employment .
On behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group , I should like to express our appreciation to both Bulgaria and Romania - to the governments , but in particular to the people in both countries - for the huge efforts they have made since the fall of Communism .
I believe that the compromise we have reached is a sound one .
Against this reproach , which is not always unjustified , it can be said that where it truly has power this Parliament acts responsibly and also achieves something .
As various honourable Members have already said , at the very least proof that different safety rules apply in the importing country should be accepted .
That is the fundamental issue on which all others depend .
Trans@@ posing the directive presents a genuine challenge for the Member States of the European Community .
We must explicitly uphold the rule of law as an essential element in the European Union , and this is a point that Commissioner Frattini constantly , and rightly , makes .
Rather than constantly criticising American domin@@ ance , we should do our utmost to ensure we , as Europeans , are united , and then we will be on an equal footing with the United States .
However , it does involve defining criteria which make up the substance of the concept of &amp; apos ; fair trade &amp; quot ; .
The appointment of a President for the euro area was a first step in this direction , but that is all it was .
It will take account of very many of the Court of Auditors &amp; apos ; criticisms , including , for example , the issue of rec@@ ording advance payments and final payments separately in the accounts .
We regard that as a central , important matter .
For this to be the case , clear objectives need to be set which allow the efficiency of Community actions to be assessed accurately .
To achieve this we need , above all , your support .
Let me just reply briefly to two points .
But our concern here must be to act within the context of a European transport policy and that means having a taxation mechanism for ecologically sensitive regions .
So I hope that the Convention comes up with the conclusive results that we will need on the institutions &amp; apos ; capacity for action , and on the concentration of competences . Let me add that I personally have doubts as to whether what we are currently discussing in relation to capacity for action and the rules governing languages will really be the final solution .
In an area which is full of hopes and fears , our fellow citizens are expecting reliable guidance , not a token body .
The demands contained in the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s amendments - he talks of the protection of minorities , rightly demands the abolition of the death penalty and calls for a solution to the Kurdish problem - are in no way conditions designed to stand in the way of aid . Instead , they are valuable proposals for the necessary democratic reforms in Turkey .
I am thinking here only of the draft regulation on animal by @-@ products products not intended for human consumption - especially Category III , but also of the future use of leftovers from me@@ als and waste from the production of foodstuffs .
In this regard , we must also make it clear that private investments are necessary , because the situation will be impossible without them .
That is what I want to comment about .
To this end , the instruments of privatisation and deregulation must be exploited to the full .
The second difference - and we have listened very attentively to this - is that you consider the European institutions strong enough to organise the neighbourhood policy themselves by their own efforts .
How do you tell the public that the want to reduce competitiveness , that you want less money spent on internal and external security , that you will , in 2007 , be putting less money on the table than we agreed for the 2006 Budget , that you want to play down Europe &amp; quot ; s role on the global stage ?
This should also be a priority goal for European industrial policy .
Of course there will be a cost , there will be political problems , and not just for us but for the eastern European states , too .
Qu@@ ality is a key issue for the entire food chain and an essential asset in supporting the competitiveness of European ag@@ ri @-@ food food producers .
I believe that we need to make progress in this area .
It is now largely accepted that the Member States cannot meet these challenges alone .
Commissioner , we cannot have a situation in the future where food is supplied to Europe from countries in which active ingredients are used that are prohibited in Europe for reasons of consumer protection .
We would be interested in hearing what the Commission intends to do about this .
I therefore consider it especially important that we in the European Union should act with the utmost vigour and tell our Member States that they should be among the first to ratify the Statute of this International Criminal Court and that they should press for the establishment of the Court and not leave it to other states , such as San Mar@@ ino and Sen@@ egal , which have devoted themselves to this cause with admi@@ rable ze@@ al .
I want to include in this expression of gratitude Parliament as a whole and in particular its President , Pat Cox .
What form might that solution take ?
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , honourable Members , in the 25 years since the nuclear accident in Chernobyl , the Commission has played a significant role in worldwide efforts to alleviate the consequences of the tragedy .
Mr President , Commissioner Vitorino , ladies and gentlemen , the Spanish initiative and Mr Coelho &amp; apos ; s report represent the fulfilment of a long@@ standing parliamentary demand .
We all recognise that Croatia has made considerable progress , and we have rewar@@ ded this progress accordingly .
We should not forget that .
It is our task to demand that it does so .
We have one major demand , and that is that the EU switch its strategy .
If that amendment should actually be adopted tomorrow - as I hope - then it would probably be the first time in the history of this Parliament that an anti @-@ atomic atomic amendment reaches the conciliation procedure .
Mr President , we have a multitude of outstanding questions post @-@ Nice Nice to which we require specific answers .
By its very nature , though , such a thing would be an empower@@ ment to seize power at the European level , and I have serious doubts as to whether that is what is intended .
But all these are only first steps .
We have had several hours of intensive discussions and I see myself as a representative of the people of Europe who clearly support the position that Parliament has taken and want to see progress in this area .
Mr President , yes Mr Seppänen , you understood me correctly .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , both the Commission proposal and the report before us are based on the premise that health should be sacrificed on the altar of structural policy .
I believe we will do it , however .
Europe will have to adapt not only to climate change but also to high energy prices .
These values must underpin everything we do in the sphere of justice and internal affairs .
I call on you to do so .
It has been a fantastic event , and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to meet you .
When we discuss postal services , we have to speak about three things .
The situation in Iraq , though , is quite different .
This was our view , but the recommendation was not adopted by the Commission .
That is in the past ; the credibility gap has been forgotten .
We have seen over recent decades that most jobs have come from small firms , that new enterprises can create a great many jobs and that the SLIM initiatives in particular are designed to relieve the burden on these firms and can therefore also produce greater competitiveness .
It is my view that any new proposal by the Commission should , in any case , provide for a specific Management Committee , as the present Management Committee for W@@ ine is already over@@ stretched by its plethora of competences .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I have followed this debate with great interest , but have had the impression at times that the various joint meetings between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection never actually took place .
I am pleased to hear that . In that case , he will probably understand this now .
The communication supports the European partnership for growth and jobs , which recognises the importance of promoting an entrepreneurial culture in Europe and creating a favourable political environment for SMEs .
However , this report can only represent the first step .
Well , that is politics .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs . - Mr President , I speak on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
We do not apply double standards , but perhaps we do look at some countries more closely than others , quite simply because we need and want to have a close relationship with these countries .
The country as a whole needs aid to be provided quickly , but it must then be distributed fairly .
The same financial conditions cannot apply to 25 Member States as did to 15 .
The Commission should therefore come up with a proposal on how dual taxation should be managed , and it must be one which puts in place a straightforward and transparent taxation system for these enterprises because , ultimately , it is the credit rating of a company that determines whether it can survive in the market and whether it will stay sol@@ vent .
However , this would be essential politically .
In this respect , the opportunity of the 50th anniversary that has just been mentioned should actually be taken to hold a democratic debate on the EU &amp; quot ; s plans and projects to date , and thus also to enable a new start for the European Union .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the topic we are considering today is one that is of great concern to many people .
We must not spread ourselves too thin@@ ly .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals are a starting point .
The Member States must move forward towards a ban , and the Council must defend the clear position that has been set out here .
Mr President , honourable Members , we need to differentiate in our assessment of the financial repercussions of the BSE crisis between veterinary measures , Community measures taken within the context of the common organisation of the market in beef and national measures .
Given the history of the last 500 years it is simply hypocritical to claim that free trade somehow automatically generates democracy and human rights , or else it shows a cynical disregard for the problems of the people involved - not on your part , I ha@@ sten to add , but by those who have negotiated the agreement and who use the safety clause so one @-@ sidedly sidedly .
If the EU really is serious about renewable energy sources with its roadmap , it must provide a fairer distribution of subsidies here , but there is no indication of this in the report on which we are voting either .
However , the prospects of success seem fairly slight , and let me quote ver@@ batim from a United Nations report we have just received : &amp; apos ; ... unless Morocco gets what it wants &amp; apos ; .
We have always said that there is a Copenhagen criterion that states that good neighbourly relations must be organised .
As you know , the deadline for implementing the recommendations in the action plan is the end of 1999 .
The bilateral problems must be resolved in parallel , if both sides - in this case Macedonia and Greece - are prepared to consider the issues .
That is a challenge to everyone : the national authorities must submit all the requisite applications and documents within the prescribed period , the Commission must deal with the case in hand on the basis of the applicable provisions , and we in Parliament must also expedite matters by means of prompt deliberation .
This debate is not about the Middle East , as we want to discuss enlargement , but it is our profound conviction that we will be successful in the fight against terrorism only if we , that is the United States of America and the European Union , support the peace process between Israel and Palestine with equal determination and in the same way , something on which there could be stronger signals from the West , to which we belong .
If that cannot be done or if we cannot agree to it , I move that , as an alternative , the vote be deferred to the next plenary part @-@ session session .
Today , we can see just how great an appeal the European Union has in numerous countries .
The Commission and the Council tend , in principle , to talk up the situation - as dramatic as it might be .
This partnership is based on shared values that are expressed in the quality of the democracy and the reforms in Ukraine .
We shall then be able to get involved with it .
But there is an extremely urgent need for radical change .
And SMEs can derive particular benefit from this form of company law because it lo@@ wers their consul@@ tancy costs and because a harmonised legal form would make it easier to start up a business , which we also want to encourage on a cross @-@ border border basis - as you said , Commissioner - by improving mobility .
It is projec@@ ted that , in the three years from 2005 to 2007 , six million new jobs will be created in the European Union .
The European Union must take determined action .
We are asking you to submit a corresponding proposal .
Instead of turning to international treaties in this field , the Member States must now reach for the European legal instruments , i.e. regulations and directives , which come into being with the participation of the European Parliament as the elected forum representing the people .
These have to do with two very real problems .
It is this all @-@ embracing embracing approach to human rights that we should make our own , and ideological speeches such as Mr Tannock &amp; quot ; s get us nowhere .
We must promote and build up the structures of civil society , for it is with them , and with all the forces that favour dialogue - particularly dialogue between cultures and religions - that we must be partners .
In so far , I call on the industry and the Commission to prove to us and to the citizens whom we represent , that legal undertakings are a good way of achieving rapid improvements , particularly in technical fields .
Both sides have approved this consensus .
We must make sure that we do not create a new divide , where the poor people outside the Roma communities are critical of the fact that the Roma are suddenly receiving large amounts of money or a great deal of attention . We need to make sure that this is a joint struggle which , of course , also aims to combat all forms of discrimination .
I put a very definite and direct question to the Commission .
I think it is important that Member States which have already done more than others to combat climate change are not put at a disadvantage .
This system of follow @-@ up up controls is seen as a very important instrument to harmonise the marketing conditions in the Member States and is therefore also endorsed in the internal market .
It should continue along this path .
Consequently , we cannot release Mr Barroso from this obligation by saying the International Monetary Fund should now sort it out .
They must be integrated , they must feel that we are there for them .
I am told that , when transactions are effec@@ ted between states in the US , the applicable sales taxes are also levied in certain cases .
. Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by saying , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , that we expect a great deal of you , because , as you stated yourself , Europe needs trust and progress .
But these disparities are also related to the different starting points at which they began the process of conver@@ ging with the European Union .
The process of integrating the electricity market in the Baltic states should include unrestricted deregulation of the market for private customers and a common energy exchange .
We should welcome any politically realistic positions adopted by Parliament which ensure that the common foreign and security policy does not remain a hol@@ low phrase .
Mr President , the very first thing I would like to do is thank the rapporteur , Mrs Dührkop Dührkop , very much indeed for this report on the Commission &amp; apos ; s fifth supplementary and amending budget , and make it known that it meets with our approval .
Commissioner Monti and the Commission as a whole have committed themselves to this .
The context for political decisions has improved , but we are still a long way from our objective .
We think this is very important .
These figures demonstrate the importance of European regulations for environmental and climate protection , but they also indicate the financial impact which this legislation will have on European industry .
The amendments proposed by Parliament were also accepted by the Council ; they were drafted and presented by Mrs Fontaine in the course of the conciliation procedure .
Both regulations create new procedural opportunities , which will also , in particular , strengthen consumer protection throughout the EU .
Today , I have voted against the amendment on driving times that the Greens have put before us , my reason being that it does not guarantee the necessary flexibility and would do the drivers a disservice .
Mr President , that would be our contribution towards a good campaign on Europe &amp; apos ; s employment strategy .
However , we do regret your decision to water down your proposal on the subject of the European trust@@ mark .
Lastly , the PPE @-@ DE DE Group calls on the Chinese Government to show goodwill in the current talks with the Dalai Lama and to bring them to a positive conclusion , which should include provision for the cultural autonomy of Tibet .
As far as the other institutions are concerned , I only have a few comments to make .
It therefore seems to me to be necessary to start by putting this into perspective .
My thanks to Mr Whitehead for his excellent report and I am particularly pleased that all the points I have mentioned are included in it .
As regards the recommendation for second reading of the report , we have been presented with two technical amendments that have been proposed by the legal service of the European Parliament .
We want to see democracy in Russia , just as much as the citizens of Russia want this themselves .
The problems are therefore largely of their own making and therefore need to be solved in future by the relevant countries themselves .
That would simplify the examination overall and make for spee@@ dier decisions for the non @-@ governmental governmental organisations in question .
The report highlights the fact that wherever the EU itself controls and ad@@ ministers the funds , there is proper budget management .
Europe is still seen as a lu@@ cra@@ tive market where there are profits to be made .
I therefore expect that the final amount allocated will be something which approaches what has been proposed by Parliament .
One of these concerns the question of the way in which the aid is to be gradually reduced .
I am addressing the Members of the Council when I say that the proposal they have already put on the table amounts to 40 % less for the EU &amp; quot ; s competitiveness , 10 % less for cohesion and growth and employment , 6 % less for rural development and agriculture , 50 % less for internal policies and 40 % less for the European Union &amp; quot ; s role as a global partner .
Nevertheless , I understand the concerns and misgivings which some people have expressed . I am prepared , and I will even take a proactive approach here , for us to consider towards the end of the next period the opportunities already available for a preliminary evaluation , in order to establish the extent to which the objectives were achieved in the individual regions , to assess whether the failure to meet targets was due to internal or external factors and to identify the conclusions we can draw for the allocation of funding during the period after next .
The value of she@@ ep@@ meat is enhanced by its having a value in the market , by Irish she@@ ep@@ meat &amp; apos ; s having a reputation in Europe .
Mr President , I very much regret having to ask once again for the patience of the House .
That , though , is how rules work ; we have to set uniform standards for all parts of the European Union without laying down special rules for Austria .
In the end , you have to decide whether you want to have European solidarity or whether you want to give in to arm@@ chair politics .
The directly elected European Parliament has no direct influence on 50 % of the budget .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Communication from the Commission on the European interest that has served as the basis for today &amp; apos ; s debate is nothing more than a kind of discussion paper .
Are you prepared to do this for the European Union ?
Mr President , I must stand up for my honourable friend .
I also believe it is very important to vali@@ date and standardis@@ e inspection procedures , so that the Member States can exercise an unambiguous right of control and so that consumers are ultimately able to assert their rights .
My only fear is that this may not be the case , and my scepticism is based on a number of points .
That security must be guaranteed , and then we could surely make progress in our dialogue with Iran .
So we were all the more surprised to read in the Flor@@ ence conclusions that the European Council notes that two Member States want to make changes to an important project on this list .
We have to do much more in this respect .
It has not been implemented yet .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am very glad that I have managed to get a few of my amendments accepted .
On 1 January 2008 Slovenia , another of Yugoslavia &amp; apos ; s successor states , will take over the Presidency of the EU Council .
The Member States themselves have likewise failed to observe their obligations .
You too have told me that , Mr Commissioner .
My hope is that the strong public opinion we have witnessed recently in Europe on this issue will help us to reach the necessary agreements .
In all these respects , I would like to see us , in future , demonstrating more consistency and making a better job of keeping to the rules .
At the same time , it has forced upon Parliament the choice between fighting for its rights and approving the enlargement treaties .
Perhaps it is only now that the open dialogue that Parliament has been striving for will begin .
Finally , my third point is that , in a fierce debate , the Commission has posi@@ tioned itself between the Council and Parliament .
Mr President , the resolution before us is long overdue .
We cannot automatically assume that all Members of Parliament behave properly and that there is no prevailing corruption .
Another important element in this context will be following up the ongoing consultation with the social partners on the restructuring of enterprises .
I would like to go into some of these points briefly .
It is making positive progress towards democracy .
The draft mem@@ orandum of understanding between the Commission and OLAF is , in our view , an important and opportun@@ e step forward .
There are two points I should like to single out from what the Council presidency said .
May I thank the rapporteur , Mr Bou@@ wman , very much for taking on this dossier and for elu@@ cid@@ ating it so well .
We need a change of attitude on the part of the people in this region .
There were a couple of things I wanted to say about this point too , however I am happy overall that we have passed this directive .
What Europe needs is concerted action in the social arena .
We have suggested energy taxation , which I know is not very pal@@ at@@ able , but we need an honest debate about these issues , mere declarations are no longer enough .
Therefore we should vote overwhel@@ m@@ ingly to adopt the proposed committee , which will form the basis for far @-@ sighted sighted legislation .
We will not permit any new division of Europe .
The Commission is approaching things from the right angle , but I urge you not to circumvent the procedures agreed in the Interinstitutional Agreement , for that is to go down a blind alle@@ y .
There will be more than enough problems to solve , the list is already before us , but best efforts have been made to this end .
I should like to say a few words to European industry . The Council &amp; apos ; s targets give our industry a clear framework , and also investment security for years to come .
I would also like to ask Commissioner Pap@@ out@@ sis when a proposal along these lines will be brought forward , because at that point we were promised such a proposal before the end of the year .
Commissioner , when will Parliament officially be consulted on a Community regulation ?
One of your remarks was particularly significant .
Mr President , Commissioner , representatives of the presidency of the Council , the fact that we are discussing a framework directive today is thanks not least to I@@ an White .
As regards ASEAN , they keep a close eye on the European Union as they attempt to cooperate and make a contribution to peace and security in the world .
Mr President , I wish to make an oral statement on the vote on the directive on working time in the road transport sector .
I see this as a great opportunity to take Europe a bit further into the midst of the citizens again through joint public relations work .
Now that this Treaty is being ratified , there is something to fight for .
What matters most - to that extent , I sympathise with some of your comments , which we fully agree with - is to win public support for the enlargement of the European Union , so that we take the people in our countries with us .
In my opinion , too little weight is being given to Objective 3 in the current debate on the future of cohesion policy .
What is , however , highly problematic about certain areas of this decision @-@ making making process is the circum@@ vention of Parliament - of Parliament , which represents the citizens of our European Union and the involvement of which is required by law and Treaty , indeed it must be involved prior to a resolution of the Council rather than afterwards .
That is an important exercise , which we must repeat in the coming year .
I am entirely in agreement with his aims .
Above all , the approach to this issue can be technology @-@ neutral neutral .
It goes without saying that Croatia will continue to receive assistance from us at Council level as it endeavours to become a Member State of the European Union .
On behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group , therefore , I greatly welcome the fact that Mr Schwaiger &amp; apos ; s report has again included safeguarding cultural diversity in the catalogue of demands .
Fourthly , we believe the completion of the internal market is central to security of supply and affordable energy prices .
That is a question I am asking myself .
This should lead Parliament to consider at which reading , first or second , it considers itself to have greater influence .
Mr President , milk is a highly sensitive product and I should like to thank Mrs Jeggle most sincerely for an effective compromise .
This has inspired me to thank you for being a vice @-@ president president who has always stood up for the rights of individual Members .
This Charter of Fundamental Rights must form the cornerstone , the foundation of the process we need if we are to provide the European Union with a constitution .
In so far , I hope for broad support tomorrow .
I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs , who have worked hard together : Mr Z@@ a@@ sa@@ da , Mrs Henn@@ is @-@ Plasschaert Plasschaert , Mrs L@@ ich@@ ten@@ berger and Mr Koh@@ l@@ í@@ č@@ ek .
He said that the Commission is influenced by it being made up of deputy leaders of European parties .
I await the Council &amp; apos ; s proposals with eag@@ ern@@ ess and am particularly keen to see the government of the Federal Republic of Germany pursue the path to which it has committed itself rather than fall to its kne@@ es .
Open debate and legal incorporation ; then we will have the opportunity to get to know Europe &amp; apos ; s citizens once again .
We should not forget , however , the general aim of the Lisbon Agenda , namely employment and ultimately growth in these sectors , nor tighten the requirements with bureaucratic obligations such as the collection of statistics , which can in fact also be obtained very easily in many sectors .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I would be interested to know whether these treaties were concluded at International Atomic Energy Agency level .
Mr President , honourable Members , I would just like to start by warmly thanking all those who have spoken in this debate for their constructive contributions .
Mr President , I should like firstly to thank you very much for the information and to present Mr Wür@@ meling &amp; apos ; s apologies , as he had to leave for Berlin at very short notice to attend an important meeting .
To this end , all the proper mechanisms must be put in place by the EU - or rather , by the Council - and that has yet to be done .
Madam President of the European Council , Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel , you will today address for the fourth time the Members of the European Parliament .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I bid you good morning !
Secondly , Member States can introduce targeted measures for small @-@ scale scale , employment @-@ intensive intensive coastal fishing .
We must not fail a second time , however .
How can we prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again ?
And from a parliamentary point of view , we too can take pleasure in the fact that some of the results of our work are reflected in the common position .
The present proposals strike a reasonable balance between the need to collect data and the aim of avoiding additional burdens on businesses and households .
It is this Chamber which must decide , and it is not you in the Commission who decides . In this way , we shall certainly arrive at a satisfactory solution .
The EU will , however , be capable of winning a majority on the proposal for a permanent WTO and ILO forum , on questions of fundamental rights and on rules of the social market economy .
We will also state that , when these problems are under discussion , we must first just put people on centre stage .
If it pers@@ ists in the common foreign and security policy , we shall have no stability and no overcoming of ethnic divides in the Balkans .
What I mean is that we need to make reforms first .
It can be assumed from this that what Parliament has now contributed in the way of progressive thinking is not being taken up .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , I think this is another reason why we need the Constitution , however .
Mr Barroso , the problem is no longer just Mr B@@ ut@@ ti@@ glione .
I should like to take the opportunity presented by my statement of how I voted on REACH to congratulate the animal welfare and environmental protection organisations on their great and wide @-@ ranging ranging commitment .
But what have we done along the way ?
Nevertheless , Parliament could have sent out a stronger signal ; the resolution remains too weak on some points .
You are not that Commissioner , which is disappointing and cannot continue .
There is no point in denying it .
rapporteur . - Mr President , thank you for giving my this opportunity to make a few comments rather earlier than anticipated .
We have seen how the Member States in the euro area are unable to police each other and to observe the 3 % limit on their own .
If we do not finally and regularly name and shame the Member States where the majority of fraud is taking place , we will lose our credibility .
It is wrong to see this as a meaningless declaration . In fact , it indicates that other forms of aid continue to be possible outside the OECD agreement : aid for research and development , for example , and regional aid .
The end product must be a directive un@@ enc@@ um@@ ber@@ ed by massive bureaucracy , one that benefits the workers on whom Europe &amp; quot ; s ability to compete depends .
Human@@ itarian aid has to be provided regardless of what has caused the catastrophes concerned and irrespective of any other political objectives .
I can tell you that the Council has already discussed this proposal at a technical level and Member States &amp; apos ; reactions are overall very encouraging .
What we need instead is ...
That , also , is Europe .
That is something that we have already discussed here in connection with the Legislative Council .
At present , there is no Commission proposal or communication on the matter before the Council .
I want now to list some of our most important demands .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , State Secretary Lob@@ o Ant@@ un@@ es has convincingly demonstrated the Council &amp; apos ; s efforts here .
Do we mean to do that every time there is a change in the area of cooperation ?
Now , as Christmas approaches , the Commission should again be compli@@ mented for such good proposals , to which no one can object !
With this in mind , I wish to express my endorsement of this proposal for a regulation .
In formal terms , these amendments ultimately fit@@ ted very well into a compromise that was excep@@ ted by the committee with 49 out of 50 votes , with one abstention .
Now , within the Commission itself - which is , after all , a collegial institution - there is not always a clear , unified position on certain issues .
If the waiting lists for operations in a patient &amp; apos ; s own country are full , the guarantee that the cost of treatment abroad will be paid for by his health insurance company will come as a huge relief .
These historical differences , which not only relate to the economy , must be taken into consideration , instead of further tightening the existing centralist constraints on the European nation states .
She was willing to make proposals in the second part and she also formulated suggestions for future policy .
I consider this to be a very , very important matter .
The various methods for promoting sales must stay within the harmonised framework which applies to all agricultural products , which is why I have to reject Amendments Nos 39 , 40 and 43 .
It is very important that , together with our partners , we put in place a system of global governance . We will only be able to do this in cooperation with our partners if we Europeans take a clear , joint approach .
There are legal and administrative obstacles , and above all there is the sec@@ tor@@ all@@ y@@ oriented thinking on the part of the administrative authorities .
Mr President , I really would like to admit to our two rapporteurs that the Treaty of Amsterdam has brought benefits and developments in its wake .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly , I would like to point out , as did the previous speaker , that a functioning internal market needs a single currency .
There are , secondly , substantive amendments that make perfect sense and will form part of the final version of the directive that will be adopted .
I also hear a lot from Mr Solana , and I hope that everyone in this House and in Europe will now at least attempt to achieve progress in the peace process in Israel and Palestine , and to implement the road map , even if it leaves a lot to be desired .
I cannot support that , and I therefore urge you to vote against these amendments .
The European Parliament &amp; quot ; s rapporteurs should be able to speak with their opposite numbers in the American Congress in order to make progress with these matters .
Does the European Parliament have a full role in making this codecision and is this also to be an issue this week in the context of the widening of the safety net ?
( Parliament adopted the joint resolution )
Relations between the EU and Russia are further stra@@ ined by the planned US missile def@@ ences in Romania .
At the same time , we should pause for thought and not immediately start pressing our but@@ t@@ ons for internal political purposes .
I therefore urge the Commission , in particular , to create a climate of stringency , so that we can achieve these agreed objectives .
On the contrary , we must learn from the economic crisis , which had its origins in the un@@ superv@@ ised financial markets in the US .
The first is the consultation ; the opinion on the Council regulation .
Leg@@ ally binding regulations must be created , similar to those in private industry , which contain a competition clause or a competition restraint clause in employment contracts .
This European home market already has a common monetary policy .
It is therefore logical for Austria to support the complete integration of the Western European Union into the EU and to take part in the creation of a common European defence policy .
This is not only about money , but also about supporting the fra@@ il and na@@ sc@@ ent civil society .
With regard to the calls for a Food Agency , I would like to point out that we would be well advised to make headway on this question .
Mr President , Commissioner , just one supplementary question .
I hope that the Council will endorse the ECB Governing Council &amp; apos ; s far more balanced recommendation and that this can be ratified before enlargement - for the scenario which is now being proposed would deal a fatal blow to confidence in the euro .
This makes it very important to note that the ECB has in fact delivered itself of a number of brief but clear and no@@ table statements on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact .
Mr President , the up@@ side of the fact that we are so late debating the old progress reports is that we can inject some up @-@ to to @-@ date date input just before the new reports are finalised .
We are all agreed on that and we would do so at once .
Mr President , the compromise which Ruth Hieronymi - of course with help from her colleagues - has devised here is one which I can wholeheartedly support .
Ex@@ emp@@ tions have been discussed and obviously I do not want to mention all of them .
We need more clear political signals here .
But what we need on the other hand are stringent , uniform legal instruments for immigration in the whole of the European Union .
The only thing one can say to this is that if you want to give Europe a constitution , you cannot be serious in attacking in this way the right to approve the Budget , which is the prerogative of the future main legislative authority , namely the European Parliament .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President President , ladies and gentlemen , first I should like to thank the rapporteur .
It is for this reason that we must be prepared to give aid to Ukraine , despite the fact that there are serious problems there as Mrs Hoff &amp; apos ; s report has shown , and that we also have problems of our own here in the European Union .
I look forward to working in cooperation with the Commission on this matter .
However , the President of the Council does not undergo a hearing here , nor is he subject to scrutiny by us or by any national parliament .
But have I de@@ duced correctly from the press that , at the beginning of last week , the Council in any case rejected this Commission proposal ?
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another .
I am merely pro@@ testing about that decision . It is entirely contrary to the Rules of Procedure , and I ask you to submit the matter to the Rules Committee .
At a time when we are re@@ discovering our common cultural and historic heritage , the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s willingness to resume a key role in the promotion of closer relations with our Arab neighbours is important .
Let me address a number of other points , therefore . In the European Union , we are very tolerant in our dealings with one another , and I trust that we shall also manage to be so in the debate on this item of the agenda .
I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs , Mrs Bo@@ wles and Mrs Berès .
The rights must be tailored to EU standards and the ILO Con@@ ventions .
That is the only way to survive this competitive situation .
I would like to take this opportunity to clarify again the position of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , and then perhaps a place might be found for it when this special report is prepared .
To sum up , I think there is something wrong with this way of going about things .
That is also happening for example in Germany and the United Kingdom .
What , then , lies behind this crisis ?
It is right and necessary for the judicial and police cooperation in Europe to be discussed and co@@ decided by Parliament .
I abstained from voting , as the report does not yet completely resolve all of the problems associated with the handling of hazardous substances .
We in this House are still waiting for the start of negotiations with the Council pursuant to Article 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement - negotiations , that is , on where the money for the three new agencies is to come from .
The report reflects the high priority attached to health and safety at work in the 27 Member States of the European Union .
I am grateful to Mr Bowis for enabling us in the European Parliament to join with the Commission in showing that the European Union is going down another road .
The Commission is aware that there are still huge challenges to be met in Indonesia .
Madam President , I have the highest respect for Mr Solana .
Finally , and this is where we return to the environmental issue , let me place special emphasis on the Committee on Fisheries &amp; apos ; request that third countries that fish in the Mediterranean should also be included , so that we can agree rules with them which at least respect the 2.5 km length of drift nets .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have a lengthy vote ahead of us today .
We will not be able simply to fall back on old models of public administration .
I stand by this agreement and if these objectives , about which Mrs Lu@@ cas has said a great deal , are fulfilled , nothing should stand in the way of success . Then this agreement would really be a milestone in the history of the contracts concluded between the European Union and a Latin American country .
- Mr President , I just wanted to say that I hope - as I trust Mr Rübig does too - that this report can be discussed in plenary as soon as possible , as it certainly should be .
Small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises ( SMEs ) in particular are an important engine for our entire economy .
I firmly reject this accusation .
Madam President , I am able to agree with Mr Cocilovo , and also to go some of the way with Mr Sterckx .
I was rather too quick .
In other words , the claims matched up to reality .
It is endeavouring to resolve the aforementioned regional un@@ rest in A@@ ce@@ h and I@@ ri@@ an Ja@@ ya and the ethnic tensions in the Mol@@ u@@ cc@@ as , by means of peaceful dialogue and constitutional reform , and I believe it is crucially important that there is a national commission on human rights that is dealing with human rights issues .
It has the right of initiative .
While there is now closer cooperation between the security forces throughout the world , there is no international consensus on minimum standards in relation to fundamental rights and legal protection .
You have already hin@@ ted at this , Commission President , but you must constantly make it clear that we will not consider any union that does not embrace the entire European Union .
The first is that businesses bear responsibility , but must also take precautions .
Secondly , I think it is important to continue and intensify your work on boosting small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises .
Our aim should be a process of cooperation in which the interests of the citizens are central .
It is therefore only logical that our Parliament should ensure that managers of companies that put the environment at risk have insurance or other precautionary financial measures in place so that they can pay for repair and restoration of the environment .
We often have grounds here to criticise American foreign policy , but in this case American foreign policy has set a very important example .
In my view , this is quite correct .
What we need most of all is a return to international standards of refugee law and application in full of the Geneva Convention on Refugees .
We want a statute for European parties .
The second is that today &amp; apos ; s debate is not taking place in a san@@ iti@@ sed vacuum , and what is happening in politics , especially the elections taking place today in the Netherlands , insofar as we have any information about them , shows that a certain segment of the population has a growing tendency to vote and act by reference to European policy .
Europe must redouble its efforts to be equal to the challenges presented by energy policy , for by 2030 the world will be using 50 % more energy and Europe will become even more markedly dependent on the impor@@ tation of fossil energy sources .
The success of any legal framework depends on the effectiveness and ease of controls on compliance with the rules it lays down .
We can expect 100 tonnes of weapons @-@ grade grade pl@@ ut@@ on@@ ium from disarmament over the next few years .
I will check in the Minutes to see which Member was concerned .
I do not believe that works .
If I may turn to the trans @-@ European European networks , indirect reference has , today , been made to your having at one time been very much in favour of using measures taken by the individual countries as a means of pressing on with coordination , and it is this coordinating role that I would ask you to exercise .
Moreover , a number of other amendments succeed in formulating provisions more precisely and eliminating contradictions .
It is in our own interest to forge a more effective and more intensive policy towards the Mediterranean .
It is time that the third pillar included an instrument comparable to Directive 95 / 46 / EC on data protection .
Mr President , Commissioner , first may I extend my warmest congratulations to Mr Ferber and Mrs Haug on the work which they have carried out .
Lastly , we must rise to the challenge of global competition and ensure that our businesses and our economy can hold their own .
Hence we need creative ideas and solutions from the Commission , not just a list of the problems .
But above all , the legislation must be clearer , to prevent law @-@ break@@ ers break@@ ers from exploiting any loopholes .
We will be supporting the report and hope that it will be adopted in the plenary .
If the Member States want to guarantee the future acces@@ sibility , quality and financial viability of health systems and care for the elderly , then what is needed most of all is more prevention and transparency .
I am pleased that Mrs Des@@ camps has presented a very good report , which points the way forward and shows us what can and could be done .
Our lifestyle , our economy , our further development - all of this depends upon it .
Hence the misgivings on our part .
