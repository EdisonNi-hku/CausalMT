Com@@ promises , by definition , do not satisfy everyone and we would say that the joint resolution is all right up to a point but we shall be tabling a number of amendments to it .

One of the most important elements of our work here today , and the vote in favour of the Lynne report , has been that it sends out a clear message , not just from the 15 countries of the European Union but also from the 10 accession countries , that we want to establish common standards and rules .

However , while all these developments are indeed welcome , I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions .

It needs to move on to stop alien@@ ating the electorate in a dangerous way .
In responding quickly to new and worrying fraud patterns reported by several Member States , the objective of this proposal is to give interested Member States the possibility , under an optional and temporary scheme , to apply the so @-@ called reverse charge mechanism , under which it is the client who has to account for the VAT to a limited number of highly fraud @-@ sensitive sectors .

In this new context , while the EU remains the first commercial power in the world and the US continues to be the first commercial partner of the EU , our cooperation is much more than that : it is a core element of the international system as it is based on common values , historic ties and strategic interests , which is not always the case for other strategic partners .

author . - Mr President , China &apos; s Communist occupation of Tibet is a long @-@ standing scourge on democracy and an open wo@@ und on the principles of justice and freedom .
The European Union exists partly so that we can work together and give value and share our experiences .
I should now like to turn to the situation in Libya , which was , of course , something we discussed on 24 and 25 March .
Pati@@ ents suffering from sle@@ eping sick@@ ness , le@@ ish @-@ mani@@ a@@ sis , den@@ gue , tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a and many others are given , too often , arch@@ a@@ ic drugs , some highly toxic , some ineffective .
We have other systems of dis@@ tribu@@ tive justice on this side of the Atlantic , not parallel@@ ed in , for example , the United States of America , which has a different but somewhat tougher product liability law than we have .
Did you vote on this matter ?
What is the procedure ?
However , the Council &apos; s position is very strange . If it gets its way in the controversy over the spare parts repair clause in article 4 , this would amount to creating and preserving monopolies to the disadvantage of consumers and the freedom of competition , and to the disadvantage of small and medi@@ um@@ sized industries which we pur@@ port to support .
It was brought to my attention just a little while ago and it contains many shocking references , one of which is about a girl waiting to be han@@ ged named A@@ men@@ eh Salam from a village in Na@@ q@@ ade@@ h whose crime is that she became pregnant without being married .
The Commission , once again , pays tribute to all the victims of ETA &apos; s terrorist attacks and recalls the importance of helping them and helping to make good damages suffered .
This proposal is currently under the cooperation procedure .
However , after the adoption of new emergency measures for the Community @-@ wide removal of specified risk materials and the introduction of rapid tests for BSE , a compromise on the legal framework came within reach .
This should help to ensure that both programmes are more focused and that each gets the level of visibility and funding it deserves .
He describes her views as socialist ver@@ ging on Mar@@ x@@ ist - which I think would come as a surprise to Mrs Fontaine , as well as to others in this House - but the most serious thing he says is that the title of her m@@ emo@@ irs should be &apos; Mein Kampf &apos; .
We very much welcome the summit that was called by Kofi Annan .
Britain &apos; s Department for Work and Pen@@ sions has not had its equivalent statement for the last 15 years - and its budget is larger than that of the whole EU !
The comments are attributed to United States diplomats and are therefore their responsibility .
Yet , even when we take in people from outside , we see in our accident and emergency departments , on a daily basis , people who in many respects are in Third World conditions , lying on trol@@ le@@ ys in unacceptable conditions .
Like Mrs Ter@@ r@@ ón i Cus@@ í , I am surprised at the stance of the EPP Group , which normally puts a lot of emphasis on family values and yet today is undermining the family by opposing reunification , which will assist the social integration of these legally resident migrants .
The international community can act as facilit@@ ator ; we can offer encouragement and support ; but the Bosn@@ ian politicians must take the lead .
You do not need the n@@ inth largest army and the fif@@ teenth largest military budget in the world .
There were two types of EU reform on offer to MEPs today .
It is also the price every one of us will have to pay next month when we start discussing the budget .
The ceremony of raising the ten new flags yesterday was wonderful and moving , but the image it presented was exclusively white .
If we are not careful , and if this crisis is badly handled , this will only result in serious and long @-@ term consequences for us all on many fronts .
K@@ ey areas of governance must be adapted to the requirements of the acquis , and some of these changes - let us be clear about this - are likely to go against the grain of tradition and expectations .
Action is also clearly needed at EU level , not just at a national level .
I call for more substantial assistance than the package already agreed to by the Commission and I insist on this .
Finally , as Palestinian reconciliation is a major step ...
It is impossible for me in three minutes to discuss adequately the details of these four complex reports , ranging from early warning systems for illegal immigration to integration of refugees , from migration policy to finger@@ printing applicants for asylum .
I will take all the supple@@ mentari@@ es together - remember that you have 30 seconds for the supplementary - and then I will ask the Commissioners to answer all the supple@@ mentari@@ es en mas@@ se .
Will the Council do everything possible to ensure this ? - because it is crucial .
This is very important for the democratisation of the European Union .
We bring Sinn Féin &apos; s agenda for change , for Irish unity and independence to this forum .
So we welcome the proposal to set up a special group within the Advisory Committee and we welcome the rapporteur &apos; s suggestion that it should have more resources .
If we are to devise a strategy to deal with this situation , then I think we also need some transparency from the industry itself .
His killing , along with that of activists from the Fun@@ cin@@ pe@@ c party , adds to a temp@@ er of political intimidation in Cambodia that is worsen@@ ed by the failure of the care@@ ta@@ ker government to respond to these murders .
Our intention is to try to balance this issue so that we have some coherence at European level , coherence of interpretation , so that we can have a European level playing field but not to interfere in the issues where the national regulators can do their jobs in a coherent manner .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , last year I spoke to Parliament about what the Commission saw as the motor of progress in today &apos; s European Union and we outlined the so @-@ called &apos; twin @-@ track &apos; approach - an activist policy agenda and an ambitious approach to the Treaty reform were goals that supported each other .
Karl Pop@@ per once said , &apos; We must plan for freedom , and not only for security , if for no other reason than only freedom can make security secure &apos; .
The Commission considers it important to clarify that EU support was never intended to cover the full cost of decommissioning , nor to compensate for all the economic consequences .
Whilst supporting the overall approach , the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection suggests that additional sectors should become subject to regulation , including drinking milk , butter , ro@@ ast@@ ed coffee , dri@@ ed pa@@ sta , rice and bro@@ wn sugar .
The bulk of the work will be done during the summer and , by the end of 2009 , we shall have this list dealt with .
It is very important if we want those countries to trade more together that we should give them greater access to our own market here .
But the funding of this programme is so tight that we should be clear about its aims and we should not be raising people &apos; s expectations .
First and foremost , the implementation of our pledge of assistance of up to EUR 500 million in support of Georgia &apos; s recovery is being honoured by us .
That is , in summary , the proposal in the text adopted today by the EP .
I hope that even the Council will try to coordinate activities on this and decide that together they will take these measures , because then it would be an extra boost , an extra imp@@ ul@@ se , for the economy .
It is perhaps a sad indictment on the European institutions that , five months after the expiry date of the legal base to this Council regulation , it has only now come before Parliament , thanks , as the rapporteur and almost every other speaker has said , to an 8 @-@ month delay by the Council in responding to Parliament &apos; s first reading .
Otherwise we will continue to have an even less common fisheries policy , compo@@ unding inequality and delivering more disaster for the sector .
There are signs of considerable improvement in some systems but , overall , there is much progress still to be made .
More than 12 Members were opposed to the oral addition to Amendment No 1
They should be sent back to Tunisia where they came from .
The international community must continue to work so that every person affected by the disaster receives food , clean water , the necessary medical care and shelter .
I also think that awareness @-@ raising measures about the dangers of smoking are crucial .
We would caution against rus@@ hing to further enlarge the EU retail fund framework .
The fact that there are 2 200 political prisoners lin@@ gering in appalling conditions in detention facilities and that the Burmese military is responsible for continuing extrajudicial killings , forced labour , sexual violence and other human rights violations cannot be und@@ one by releasing one political activist , no matter how prominent .
Firstly , excise duties have not been harmon@@ ized as promised .
I recall Commissioner Bjerregaard saying at the press conference at the end that we would have wanted to achieve more , that we always do , but that this was as much as we could persuade the other parties to the conference to agree to .
It is deeply appreciated .
B@@ ack in the year 2000 when we were going through economic boom times , we made promises and we made commitments .
As you know , summ@@ ers are becoming hot@@ ter and the consumption of electricity at that time increases tremend@@ ously , so every year there is more and more demand for electricity and the networks are over@@ loaded .
We have a commitment from the main European companies in this sector .
In the media it seems that Tony Blair would be the person .
There has been a lot of publicity on this particular issue all over Europe .
Where are the difficulties ?
But before I sat down last time I also said I hoped that the Council would make a better job of this than we did .
I would like to know exactly how many people you counted in the chamber today ?
Mr President , it has been , as always , a pleasure to work with my friend Bill Miller on these technical directives and I believe that we will have made a significant improvement to this directive if it is approved .
The Commission approach on this is somewhat different and would seem to be more neutral .
We de@@ test the excess of paper , but given the requirements that we have to check and re @-@ check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control , sometimes the requirements of administration , which some call bureaucracy , are unavoidable .
Or your own wife ?
Mr President , I want to congratulate President Santer on his continuing efforts to get national governments as well as the European institutions to give this serious problem the priority it deserves .
To conclude , let me confirm the Commission &apos; s position on all amendments .
Not only are these campaigns emo@@ tionally charged , they muster distorted and misleading information to support their ultimately un@@ tenable and ir@@ rational opposition to the new technology of genetically modified crops .
We must realise that we will have a lot of ups and dow@@ ns in our relationship and that we will have both progress and set@@ backs . Perhaps we are seeing something new being born .
Others have argued that we are asking for too much data , for example , that there should not be a requirement to retain un@@ answered calls .
However , this report provides the inspiration to look again at the wild and nearly wild areas in the EU and to see if there are instances where additional European actions can help protect these special places .
Mr President , I will be very brief , but since Mr Schulz mentioned my name , let me at least say the following : Mr Schulz , I had no wish in what I was saying in any way to attack you personally , but I think we have a serious debate here about how to create competitive economies and how to stimulate competitive economies consistent with social cohesion and environmental stability .
In these countries , any opposition activist , critical journalist or simply any Muslim practi@@ sing his belief , risks ending up in a torture chamber , a penal col@@ ony or on death row on charges of terrorism , religious extremism or an attempt on the life of the President .
The Commission has been in contact with European and other airlines and there have been discussions about state aid or insurance and how these should be channelled .
But the fundamental importance of it is this : it signi@@ fies and typ@@ i@@ fies a belief that Brussels has a right to set agendas and to dictate to Member States how they should prioritise issues and expenditure that quite pat@@ ently are within their own domain and should be exclusively so , because any region has the right to decide within its limited budget what its priorities are .
I think we can do that .
If Copenhagen is not a complete success , let us not cry wol@@ f and start naming and sha@@ ming , but let us set out a clear process and time path in order to come to a result .
I will now switch to my own language .
The percentage for women is the same : 51 % of women who are seeking work are in the 50 @-@ 64 age group .
That statement calls for the prompt release of those whom the European Union considers to be prisoners of opinion .
Concerning the question where , we keep being told about Inter@@ la@@ ken and it may be that Inter@@ la@@ ken was the place where decisions were taken - high @-@ level decisions taken by lower @-@ placed officials .
I was very pleased that the last European Council reaffirmed that we will honour existing commitments .
I think the term &apos; justification &apos; is also problematic .
The European Union now has the distinction of being the main user of synthetic drugs such as ec@@ stasy and amp@@ he@@ tam@@ ines .
At the same time , I do not take sides .
Our economies are still very fragile .
The facts are that a single crack in the cooling system was discovered with a lea@@ k of water , described in the Spanish press rather in@@ appropriately as radioactive .
Finally , minimum standards of financial controls must be adhered to .
If this is carried tomorrow by Parliament , then I hope the Commission will disregard it entirely because I regard this as completely irresponsible .
This democratic accountability is vital , especially at a time when Member States are themselves making severe cuts to their national expendi@@ tures .
That would simply be too embarrassing .
The report also called for a review of Parliament &apos; s expenditure in order to guarantee savings are made in future .
It is our firm belief that the impressive changes in financial markets prompted by the introduction of the euro call for a substantial enhancement of the mechanisms for cooperation between national authorities and with the Eurosystem .
As others have said , it has been a concern in a number of Member States for many years and of particular concern for EU residents who travel , let alone those who reside in places like the United Kingdom or Ireland .
The second issue which must be discussed is what is to be done in the case where a legal base has been proposed but not accepted .
We will also vote in favour of Amendment No 43 , which proposes an assessment of the effectiveness of this directive and vote against other amendments that try to be too prescriptive .
I have just spoken to the President of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and I appeal to other groups to support it because it will enable this report to be agreed in full .
Now we can say that the banana barons in the United States are actually buying the United States and buying favours from the people on Cap@@ it@@ ol H@@ ill in Washington .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , there is a credible sounding justification for each one of the four financing instruments being presented to Parliament today .
Stakehol@@ ders do not want us to take the risk of opening a P@@ and@@ or@@ a &quot; s box .
There has not been a shortage of good ideas or good plans to achieve equality in the past but their implementation has often failed .
I also discussed the matter with the Foreign Minister , Mr L@@ av@@ ro@@ v , who assured me that there would be changes to the proposal at second reading in the Duma .
In addition , economic development has promoted political stability throughout the region .
There are , however , some gaps in the proposals which we wish to see filled .
It is clear that Hizbollah seriously mis@@ calculated the scale of the re@@ tribution when it decided to kill eight soldiers and kid@@ na@@ p two from northern Israel .
A final point : we have heard nothing about the results of the EU troika that went to southern Africa in the middle of last month .
However , I was and I am totally opposed to the amendments which have been adopted and which support the harmonisation of taxes .
I am sure that Professor Diamandouros will undertake his responsibilities in a way which will enjoy the confidence of this Parliament and which will overwhelmingly earn the confidence of Europe &apos; s citizens as well .
National authorities can also play an important role in evaluating the impact of reforms already undertaken .
Mr President , it is quite clear that across the political spectrum we all want adequate , sustainable and safe European pension systems .
This agreement is very good for China and Europe ; it is good for the Asian region and for the world and , as we saw , it almost certainly had a beneficial effect on the vote in the US Congress .
We do not support the proposal that the UK should dismantle fis@@ si@@ le material production facilities .
There is a clear way ahead .
There have been a number of problems regarding amendments such as the order of the amendments and how they have been group@@ ed together .
We have only to think of the political persecution in Burma , the economic persecution in East Timor , the religious persecution in Indonesia , Malaysia and Korea and the persecution of mothers and fathers in China for concei@@ ving an unauthorised child and the added persecution if it is a girl child .
Although we could find that vulnerability is a problem at lower levels - in the poorest regions , for example - it has a bearing on the whole territory and touches upon all social categories living there .
In its declaration , Kosovo committed itself to fully respecting extensive rights for Kosovo Serbs , especially with regard to local self @-@ government in education , culture and health , in line with the comprehensive proposal presented by UN Special En@@ voy Mar@@ tti Ahtisaari .
We would like the Council to assist us with the earliest possible time but if they fail to approve the Commission by 5 May , then at least we should have as a fall@@ back that we can approve the Commission within the life of the Parliament .
The best thing we can do is to approve the urgent resolution we have agreed together with all the groups so that we can increase pressure on the Chinese authorities .
First , a general reduction in air travel through encouragement of the use of other , less polluting means of transport , such as rail transport .
Emissions trading , the CDM and joint implementation are all crucial elements to the Protocol and will remain essential in the years to come .
The situation is critical , but the long @-@ term objective continues to be , despite everything , that deeper and broader relations should be established with a country that is an important regional and international player .
Is it not time that the scientists and the fishermen got together instead of having the conflicting evidence that we always have ?
I believe that most women scientists would agree with this .
For the control bodies that are listed in paragraph 5 , I agree in principle to the request for formal accre@@ di@@ tation , but adequate governmental supervision should also be acceptable as an alternative in that situation .
These are Amendments Nos 4 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 22 , 23 , 24 and 26 . I will briefly give our reasoning on each of these .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate you on the excellent job you did today .
It is important to underline that the problems identified did not arise from the Fund itself , but in individual countries from the people contracted to implement the programmes .
Af@@ ter@@ wards we will start a wide consultation , the results of which will be used to draw up the final version of the Community strategic guidelines .
These will be generated by high levels of research and development spending close to the market .
In considering this legislation , would you bear in mind that a certain flexibility is certainly desirable ?
Yesterday the Agenda stated quite clearly that after Ur@@ gen@@ cies , voting starts at 5.@@ 30 p.m .
( Before the vote on Section I )
As I have done on so many occasions in the past , I repeat my call that in order to ensure an appropriate policy of decentralisation it is essential to maintain access to the territorial waters of 12 miles as the exclusive sovereign preserve of the coastal States and to extend this preserve to 24 miles , as previously agreed by this House in February 1999 .
There have been a lot of spur@@ ious arguments here tonight , particularly about thresholds for receiving funding .
It will help us to move forward on a solid basis to the next phase in the development of a marine strategy .
Free and fair access to raw materials is important for the EU economy .
Unfortunately colleagues included &apos; sexual and reproductive rights &apos; in the list of priorities and I cannot and will not ever condone the killing of fellow human persons , in this case babies before birth .
We have recognised this in the framework of the European cohesion policy .
The Commission has been aware of the deficiencies of the Greek asylum system , which is confronted with exceptional pressure due to high numbers of mixed migration flows on its territory and the lack of a proper functioning national asylum system .
The second thing I would like to say is that , as a couple of Members have already said , the CAP is , of course , not ideal .
The Stability and Growth Pact requires the Commission to prepare a report whenever an actual or planned deficit of a Member State exce@@ eds 3 % of GDP reference value .
Today , having a bank account is a prerequisite for being able to fully participate in social and economic life , and all EU citizens should have access to a basic bank account .
On the issue of tax on air k@@ ero@@ sen@@ e , the issue has already been discussed with the Member States .
This is where new jobs should be created in the future : in the small- and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
I think the Commission needs to examine its own role in this crisis .
You could not hear this when Mr Sur@@ j@@ án read his text .
Nevertheless , it is , of course , right that we should continue to monitor the situation and that , if there are any unexpected increases in fishing products coming from Papua New Guinea , the Commission should take appropriate action .
Its gross domestic product is the largest in the world and it is the world &apos; s top player in international trade .
I really think , out of these 11.@@ 7 million jobs created over the last eight years in the European Union , almost 100 % of the net growth of new jobs in Europe has come from the services sector , and everyday statistics prove this .
The Commission attaches great importance to the renewal of the Daphne programme , which clearly meets a deeply felt need within the voluntary sector and the general public .
I am happy to make available to you , President , copies of both my letter to the European Patent Office and its reply to the Commission .
Succ@@ essive EU presidencies , in seeking to establish a consensus in the Council on the direct trade regulation , have investigated possible solutions , but without success so far .
Cor@@ ruption in international adoption has been clearly a problem .
Why a closer relationship with Brazil ?
It should not be added to the total number of votes .
They will be able to increase production up to and beyond the point at which the quota will be over @-@ subscri@@ bed .
Parliament &quot; s contribution to this process has been significant .
Either way , they are values that we should promote and respect .
The industry was aware of the do@@ d@@ gy and unsafe fit@@ t@@ ings of the c@@ asks and I am given to understand that the smaller c@@ asks , which were transported to Sellafield had never been tested for their effectiveness , safety and efficiency .
Such plans should serve as a framework for actions that engage relevant partners and stakeholders . They should define institutional responsibilities and should be based on good practice and safety promotion .
Chancellor Schüssel , you have called for referendums on the Constitution , so why do you not offer a referendum to your own people ?
I would stress this : people have told me that this has nothing to do with work / life / family balance .
I appeal to you , Madam President , to use your good offices to impress upon the Commission the concern of this House about the impact of the atrocities of 11 September in Europe where thousands , if not millions , of jobs are at risk .
All the activities pursued by the Member States also benefit the European Union .
We are studying what else can be done in order to help small @-@ scale coastal fisheries .
Member States who are reluctant to do this do not want to face up to the fact that our coast@@ s have to be protected .
However , how much longer are we to go on fixing times for votes , which today was to be noon and then became 12.@@ 10 p.m. and is now going to be 12.@@ 20 p.m. ?
Ireland has succeeded and no longer has the high unemployment of 17 or 18 % of the past , when the annual em@@ igration equ@@ alled the entire labour market growth of the country ; when our exports were in decline and economic growth was negative ; when we had no money for the less well off in our society .
S@@ laugh@@ ter@@ houses in Greece are approved by the competent authorities under Council Directive 64 / 4@@ 33 on health conditions for the production and marketing of fresh meat as amended by Directive 95 / 23 .
Re@@ ference was made to the United States , and its Marine M@@ am@@ mal Protection Act was enacted in 1972 , which was before the International Convention on Trade in En@@ danger@@ ed Spe@@ cies entered into force in 1975 .
Our eloquent rapporteurs who quote Shakespe@@ are in their advo@@ cacy of ha@@ ste , should , I think , also note King John , Act V , Sc@@ ene II , where a suppli@@ c@@ ant said , &apos; According to the fair play of the world , let me have audience &apos; .
All this aims at intensi@@ fying the political dialogue between our institutions and , from my perspective , we seem to have designed the right instruments for this in our framework agreement .
The Commission has now come forward with a legislative proposal to cut the tariff to zero on 75 tariff lines covering 27 % of Pakistan &apos; s exports to the EU , which would boost Pakistan &apos; s exports by about EUR 100 million a year .
This evaluation should come in time for a decision by the budgetary authority on the corresponding amending budget later in spring .
Mr President , the images of last summer &apos; s flooding in Pakistan were indeed shocking , and the European Union rightly sought to implement aid measures to assist the millions of Pakist@@ an@@ is whose lives were devastated by this terrible disaster .
I also look forward to more details on the rules of origin , because it is quite difficult to judge at this point whether what is being proposed is anything more than cosmetic .
We are now dealing not only with the aftermath of that disruption and its financial impact but also with the present ongoing uncertainty of continued and prolonged disruption to European airspace .
In conclusion , the challenge to this House is Anglo @-@ American law and whether Anglo @-@ American law will super@@ se@@ de the European model .
So it was almost certain by then that something of this nature might happen .
I call upon the President of this House to make a statement as soon as possible to express our strong support for the Government of Turkey and our dismay at the interference of the army in the politics of the country .
Yet non @-@ payment of in@@ voices presents a real problem to their manager , David Ste@@ ar .
We have common interests like fighting nuclear proliferation and building peace in the Middle East .
I am submitting today , to the United Nations rapporteurs on torture and religious freedom , a dossier relating to some of the people I had contact with when I was in Beijing two years ago .
These programmes will certainly benefit our young people and give them invaluable opportunities to learn about themselves , about others and about Europe .
The Socialist position is much more complex .
What are the main obstacles to the creation of an EM@@ F ?
In my view , other points also deserve to be mentioned , for example the extension of many budget lines , Community programmes and provisions on trade in services to the O@@ CT@@ s .
the Commission statement on the EU response to the migration flows in North Africa and the Southern Mediterranean , in particular , in Lampedusa , and
Ori@@ gin marking would be of considerable help there .
In the context of pre @-@ accession aid to the region it may be possible to re@@ direct some of the assistance we are giving under IS@@ P@@ AR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident , as long as the polluter @-@ pays principle is fully respected .
This is an absolutely trav@@ esty .
I support this report because it highlights the need to be more efficient with energy .
I am therefore sick@@ ened that anybody should expect that their republi@@ can@@ ism can be used as an excuse for violent and despicable acts of murder , particularly in the case of Robert McCartney .
With regard to the cases of the two women mentioned in Parliament &apos; s resolution , I can assure the honourable Members of Parliament that the European Union and the Commission are following the case very closely .
It is crucial , therefore , that we flag up the in@@ adequ@@ a@@ cies that were inherent in the system and ensure that we go further in our aim to make better use of European taxpayers &apos; money .
Work fast !
All of these things will mean something when we assume the responsibility in this House to legislate .
In S@@ r@@ p@@ ska , which has been ethn@@ ically cleans@@ ed , there was politics of a different sort .
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control .
The first is inter@@ parliamentary cooperation through the creation of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and its committees .
It was encouraging to listen to Mr Casaca in this respect .
I merely reiterate for clarity that my responsibilities today are to discharge my duties on behalf of the Presidency , rather than to articul@@ ate the national position of the United Kingdom Government .
So , no single Member State would be forced to accept the CCCTB and to use it .
The process of am@@ al@@ g@@ am@@ ating farms and the buying @-@ up of farm units by con@@ sor@@ tia pushing up prices un@@ realistically is already well advanced in my nation of Wales and is becoming the sad pattern in other regions and nations as well .
Too many people still live in unacceptable conditions in Romania &quot; s institutions .
Obviously , the issue of religious freedom is absolutely critical in negotiations with Turkey .
Since then I have been fortunate to take part in literally sco@@ res of debates - more , I am told , than any other Commissioner : such is Parliament &quot; s interest in external relations .
Their interests were not being best served in the talks that have gone on to date .
The Commission is very much aware of the structural problems in the sector too .
They produce un@@ subsidised wines that people want to buy , at a price they can afford .
The rapporteur Mr Kuhne mentioned the key word &apos; helicopters &apos; , which , as you know , is one of the difficulties that the international community is facing now with regard to crisis management operations .
Mr President , I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Cunha , in his absence and wish him well in his new job .
Even if I am very critical about the whole of the Union approach , I might very well agree with your &apos; whole @-@ of @-@ the @-@ island &apos; approach .
Many possibilities exist .
However , I hope you agree that the spending you propose on TENs and on defence must be compatible with Member States &apos; commitments under the Stability Pact , which is already under great strain .
The desire from an environmental perspective for a wholly mandatory regime must fit well with market considerations and be industry @-@ friendly .
I have serious doubts about this .
We will have nuclear power in the future , whatever all of us here today agree about on this issue .
One of the major objectives of the proposal is to focus checks on long journeys - these are the most critical for the welfare of animals .
The risk that funds might run short should be avoided . This is completely manage@@ able , given the amounts involved .
Whether it is a state @-@ to @-@ state or state @-@ group @-@ to @-@ state @-@ group link is an open question .
I set out my own philosophy in my recent speeches at Bo@@ c@@ coni and at the OECD in Paris , where all those national authorities from around the world that are active in the competition field were gathered .
Mr President , apparently all the science of climate change is nonsense , according to Mr Bloom , because we have had a cold winter .
I do not believe it should be an EU competence in any case .
There is increasingly a European single market for the free movement of stolen goods : cars , for example ; illegal services - prostitution ; dirty capital waiting to be la@@ under@@ ed in other Member States ; illegal immigrants smugg@@ led in by organized criminal gangs .
All they need to do is to state that they will strengthen the existing provision in the Schengen acquis .
It does absolutely nothing .
That is the key issue in making Europe the leading knowledge economy in the world .
But I want to say this also : I have had the privilege to visit many groups , many committees , many inter@@ groups .
The report constitutes a useful analysis of measures to encourage theatre and the performing ar@@ ts throughout the EU , particularly focusing on the need for mobility .
Mr President , I too would like to add my words of congratulations to John Cushnahan on this report .
Why should they care about the details of qualified majority voting if they have lost their jobs ?
The report is clear in its praise of the commitment and experience of most officials .
Many people are resistant to change because of the fear of taking that step into the unknown .
Madam President , Baroness Ashton will not be surprised if I express disappointment , not in the performance of the European common security and defence policy ( CS@@ DP ) , but in the fact that she still insists on flo@@ gging this particular unnecessary and very expensive dead horse .
What would happen then if someone fleeing from persecution were to seek asylum or help from the EU emb@@ assy if it did not suit the EU &apos; s interests to support him or her ?
It reduced in real terms by 30 % .
If the House continues to organise its business in this way we will not only be a laugh@@ ing @-@ stock but we will fail to get through the very serious business that we have .
I want to tell you that the area that I represent here in Parliament - the constituency of Wales - is a country that was mark@@ edly affected by the foot and mouth outbreak .
I will be presenting this package to the Council of Fisheries Ministers in Luxembourg on 24 June with the intention of adopting a formal proposal on this subject as early as July .
First there is an issue I raised with the Italian presidency regarding the broad economic guidelines and that is the reason for the change that was made by Ecofin to the Commission &apos; s proposals .
I think it is the only basis on which we can move forward in the country .
It was a considerable success .
The cost will eventually be a burden on the taxpayers of the European Union and not the industry .
I believe it makes sense to have these incentives for compliance - some people speak of sanctions - because we need the credibility of those instruments to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact is respected .
The US Administration is not going to change its position before the election .
We have contributed over EUR 2@@ 70 million .
Your report has made a good start by rejecting some of the mis@@ concep@@ tions and scare stories about the Constitution .
That delayed the evacuation in perfect conditions for the people on board that ship by over 20 minutes .

Legal and political reforms must be broa@@ dened and their implementation consolidated to make them truly irreversible .
I think that all of us should assume our obligations , and this is the only way the Community can proceed .
I am sure the Member will understand that , within the range of material I have , this is as comprehensive as I can be .
Unless we do , there will be no change , we will be back to the status quo and the complaints will continue .
Furthermore , I warmly welcome the fact that the Icelandic authorities have started intensive communication activities .
I will again renew my offer to this Parliament to cooperate when we are making our efforts to get the Lisbon Treaty finally in place .
As regards international issues , Kosovo will certainly be one of the most important and we need to consider jointly with Russia how to bring this question to a solution , based on the ongoing efforts of the Troika .
In the preparation now of the common agricultural policy for post 2013 , and in the light of the results of the ongoing negotiations on climate change , the Commission will examine ways to further and better integrate adaptation and mitigation objectives in the common agriculture policy instruments .
I note what the rapporteur says about Amendments Nos 23 and 24 regarding the possibility of putting up a list of products and unit prices .

Consequently , the same safeguards are not required for medicines given to horses .
I look forward to further discussion of this important issue in the future .

The targets we have set for Europe for 2020 are an important milestone , but they are no more than that .
There are not many of them and maybe the people of Ireland were saying something about that in the decision in the referendum which they recently made .
An extra GBP 1 billion of costs for the airlines will not benefit passengers but will penalise them by increasing the price of tickets and reducing choice .
As an extra precau@@ tion , I am vali@@ dating this advice to our scientific committee .
What part of the word &apos; no &quot; does Mr Juncker not understand ?
For me , too , it may be too much , even though my time is six minutes , not ten .
We have to continue our dialogue with the Russian authorities on this point .
After all , we in Parliament thought of the date of 2004 in the beginning , and the same date is appropriate for Bulgaria .
Indeed he has used the very words Gordon Brown used when he attended the Economic Committee : &apos; no plans to revisit this issue &apos; , he said , and I hope that the Presidency will long stick to that .
In Iran , journalists who dare criticise the regime are locked up , but Israel has a free press .
If we do not contribute to solving the tragedy in East Timor , the message to East Timor &apos; s people and to others is this : democracy is sy@@ non@@ ym@@ ous with death .

My congratulations once again to the rapporteur .
Mr President , let me start by acknowledging the contribution that my colleague , Mr Moreira Da Silva , has made to the emissions trading directive and all matters relating to Kyoto for so long .
The Commission and the European Union give a vast quantity of money to developing countries , the majority of which to Africa .
Mr Ham@@ mer@@ stein Min@@ tz talked of Gaza representing &apos; a light of hope &apos; .
The protection period will give the innovative pharmaceutical industry an opportunity to recover its R &amp; D investments .

I would like to know if there is any indication that markets themselves are responding to what is an increasing number of single people perhaps just looking for &apos; the b@@ less@@ ed peace of the single bed &apos; , to quote George Bernard Sha@@ w .
It seems to me a good thing for farmers on a voluntary basis to add value to their produce through quality assurance schemes , and we should be supporting them , not discoura@@ ging them .
I am afraid to have to report that the situation of Christians in Iraq , and the Ass@@ yri@@ ans in particular , continues to deteriorate .
We look forward to the White Paper next year and we hope we will be able to continue the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed so far on this important subject .

It ex@@ poses young people through well @-@ designed educational programmes to the differing lifest@@ y@@ les and individu@@ ality of each EU country , while at the same time helping them to appreciate more their own rich and diverse heritage .
I have probably done too much because at the end of the day , as Mrs Pack said , they have to do this by themselves .
Mr President , I just want to rise ahead of Christmas to say &apos; thank you &apos; , for once , to the European Commission for having announced the aid of over EUR 170 million out of the European Solidarity Fund to help towards the clean @-@ up operations after the floods in my country , and especially in my region , this summer .
We have to demonstrate that the politics of this Union can solve their problems .
Go@@ ing on even the most optimistic assumptions of the Stern Report , the cost of inaction is more than 10 times what we are now proposing .
It is made even more complicated by the fact that the age when school children start statutory education also varies from Member State to Member State .
But it is going to take an ending of the regime of Robert Mugabe , a mur@@ dering thu@@ g , for this to become a reality .
While peak exce@@ ed@@ ances are falling across Europe , the average level is continuing to rise , almost certainly as a result of pollution generated far from our shores .
It is surely a matter of very great regret that this determination to tackle BSE has taken so long to emerge .
While we are worrying about early years learning , putting out all our propaganda about drawing Europe together , and producing The Ras@@ p@@ ber@@ ry I@@ ce Cre@@ am War , and while our children are being encouraged to read the un@@ inten@@ tionally hil@@ arious &apos; Cap@@ tain Euro &apos; , our part of the world is being over@@ taken by more vi@@ ri@@ le countries that have learned the benefits of decentralisation and the dis@@ pers@@ al of power .
Without it charities will lose millions of euros each year .
The decisions made by national electorates in these countries with regard to the spending priorities they adopt and the economic policies they pursue now have very little effect .
They are all very different .
I am not sure how long the Commission is going to test out the codes of conduct before it legisl@@ ates .
Mr President , I would say this to the Commissioner : If you will forgive the pu@@ n , the milk crisis is something the Commission has made a pig &apos; s ear of , a saying we have in Ireland when somebody has made a complete ha@@ sh of something .
The West has been held to ran@@ so@@ m by oil @-@ producing states , and we have transferred billions upon billions of dollars to corrupt and des@@ po@@ tic regimes .
It is essential that the remaining legislative and practical steps be completed rapidly .
In each case , specific provisions have been devoted to public service obligations .
rapporteur . - Mr President , in opening this discussion I would like us to imagine ourselves as one of those people we represent , perhaps off on holiday to another European country or a young person off to study somewhere else , or somebody off to a business meeting in another European capital , or even to work on a building site .
We have added two more areas to it : one is sustainable consumption , and the other is services of general interest , so we are expanding .
in writing . - I support this resolution which calls , inter alia , on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Member States to work towards a strong EU common position on the follow @-@ up to the Goldstone report and demands the implementation of its recommendations and accountability for all violations of international law , including alleged war crimes , and urges all sides to conduct investigations that meet international standards of independence , impartiality , transparency , promp@@ tness and effectiveness , in line with United Nations General Assembly Resolution A / 64 / L@@ .@@ 11 .

The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law , democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC @-@ Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year .
This strategy is to be implemented through three main strands .

It not only covers persons working in private households , but also for them , as well as persons employed by employment agencies .
in writing . - British Labour MEPs joined with the Socialist Group in voting in favour of this report .
Though I might not experience it from this place , I can guarantee that I will keep an eye on you when you take upon yourselves the new responsibilities for the agricultural sector .
I would also like to draw the Commission &apos; s attention to compromise Amendment No 23 , which highlights the difference between the rates of excise duty on wine , beer and spirits and says it should not be increased .
It may surprise the Commissioner to have such a representation from Scotland , but Scotland is probably one of the greatest victims of this situation in the Channel Tunnel .
I would like to reiterate the Commission &apos; s gratitude to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the effective and constructive way in which they have participated in the discussions between the institutions over recent weeks .
If it is good regulation , it will serve research and make it more focused and effective . &apos; Look before you leap &quot; has always been a good and useful max@@ im .
It seems to me that we are not or@@ dering our affairs as efficiently as we should .
This is a very good outcome and that is why we support the rapporteur &quot; s original line .
Otherwise , the taxpayers will pay for additional energy supplies .
Also , the single market for energy is , of course , extremely efficient .
They could be , and raising them is a major challenge for the Union .
If there is , that shows why we need to put it in .
As with the decision on the 2012 calendar , this is a contribution to cutting Parliament &apos; s costs .
Second , in terms of emerging risks , I hope the Commission will look at the need for new laws in areas such as harassment at work , recently called for by Parliament .
Mr President , I welcome the positive and determined stance being taken by the Swedish Presidency , and particularly the Minister &apos; s determination that the agreement in Copenhagen should be up@@ gra@@ dable and include monitoring mechanisms so that it can be adjusted in the light of new scientific research .
The first is the colleague who expressed concern that we will end up with a concentration of power in very few utilities .
Whilst we fully support Palestinian elections and the need for Palestinian people to elect their own leadership , we continue to caution against elections if the legal , administrative and log@@ istic framework for elections , including the political environment , is not in place .
That is something which , I am afraid , will become more and more a feature of your presidency , but we will have more and more occasion to take hard decisions .
It is going to very difficult for us to justify our position .
We look forward to eventual Turkish membership of the EU .
A final word on the interinstitutional dimension .
However , it would probably be easier if I change to my mother tongue , which I shall now do .
If , in the developing countries , we have not yet always seen the results we wanted to see , that is also because sometimes good governance has not yet been achieved .
T@@ rying to get Turkey to become an EU Member is turning from a bad joke into a nightmare , and our citizens , who will pay de@@ arly for our mistakes , realise this much better than we think they do .
I am very glad to see also that the new guidelines that will be introduced for Radio Tele@@ vision Hong Kong will be based on those applying to the BBC and other international broadcasters , thus helping guarantee its neutrality .
I firmly believe that the Dan@@ es@@ in report will be a great and positive step along the way , building on the Commission communication to create such public @-@ private sector partnerships .
The committee has also taken a strong view on export refunds .
In this regard I would say a special word of thanks and appreciation to the German presidency for the great work they did on the Statute and bringing us to where we are today . But for you , Mr President , for the presidency and Parliament helping , we would not be where we are .
In line with this requirement the Commission prepared its first report which concludes that the shipbuilding industry in the global market is facing serious over @-@ capacity problems .
I have four specific questions to Commissioner Monti concerning that .
Mr President , I will be very brief because any sentiments I express will largely echo the remarks that have been made with some passion and knowledge of the country by Members who have already spoken .
The definition takes into account not only the quantitative sustainability but also the ecological sustainability of forestry .
Member States should be free to set their own tax regimes and decide their own priorities for infrastructure charging and improvements .

Mr President , the Commission is committed to addressing the dramatic humanitarian crisis in Angola effectively and without delay and to supporting the peace process .
Mr President , I should like to start by saying that this Commission and I , as Commissioner for Trade , are fully committed to working very closely with Parliament , in line with the framework agreement governing relations between the two institutions .
Decis@@ ive action was also agreed on non @-@ cooperative offshore tax havens .
I trust that I have answered the questions satisfactorily .
I would stress that robust reporting is essential for accountability and for explaining to Europe &apos; s citizens the contribution of our policy to agriculture and rural areas .
The Commission must through regular and transparent evaluation ensure the implementation of the relevant ILO conventions .
The urgency is clearly illustrated by one extraordinary statistic : 20 million tonnes of fish are being discarded worldwide every year , equivalent to about one quarter of total world catches .
We can never buy off the big@@ ots ; we will only encourage them further .
I firmly believe that the Union &apos; s approach to the development of the global navigation satellite system is vitally important , not only for transport reasons , but also in terms of employment , competitiveness and our wider strategic interest .

The next meeting will be in Africa and will cover the problems of the region .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to congratulate Mr Lange on the completion of this important report .
The Commission can play its role by keeping waste management issues high on the Community policy agenda and providing high quality information .
Now , since Mr Heaton @-@ Harris wants a referendum today on the Lisbon Treaty in the UK , he is clearly confident that the British public would read all the documents to make up their minds how to vote .
The negotiations on a Cyprus settlement are in the final phase as we meet here today .
That is why it is so important to adopt the directive on the information and consultation of workers without delay , together with a review of the European Works Council Directive and the Colle@@ ctive Red@@ und@@ ancies Directive , which incidentally proved to offer so little protection to the Cor@@ us workers in my constituency .
The world cannot afford the instability which would come from a unilateral and pre @-@ emp@@ tive military adv@@ ent@@ ure in Iraq .
I do not know if the Commissioner is familiar with this .
So , we are moving at the right time and it can benefit the most marginalised so that they can all look forward to having a house , a hear@@ th , a sto@@ ol and the sh@@ ining del@@ ph .
First of all , the agreement that was reached with the Council in relation to the shor@@ tening of the pro@@ se text is something which will automatically be dealt with in accordance with the agreement as I have identified a moment ago .
If science allows us to distinguish between animals which have been vacc@@ inated and those carrying the disease , then vaccination should be allowed whenever requested .
But it highlighted to me , in a simplified form , the problem that we are trying to address with this revision : as Commissioner Mandelson said , a revision that goes back some 20 years or more .
Bro@@ ad@@ ly speaking , we can welcome it as evi@@ den@@ ced by the fact that we have not tabled any amendments .
The case was that Germany &apos; s transposition of that Directive insofar as the activity of doctors and hospitals was concerned , in particular as regards time spent on call by these doctors , was in breach of the Directive .
Mr President , a number of Members would have noticed that at the last Strasbourg part @-@ session there were a number of very close votes .

Member of the Commission . - The most recent edi@@ tion of Eurostat crime and criminal justice statistics that was published date back to 29 May ; it covers the period from 1998 to 2007 and it does not indicate the increase described by the honourable MEP .
Transport has been identified as one of the more intra@@ ctable sectors , with carbon dioxide emissions from transport the fastest growing , despite the progress made through our agreement with the European Automob@@ ile Manu@@ fac@@ turers Association .
The Scottish Government , I am afraid , blame you , Commissioner , for that particular measure - for the ra@@ m@@ ping up of the inspections and the penalty systems .
Can I say , too , that we are almost always the first to produce statements , the first to come out and say what we think should happen .
The report is a clear indication that Iraq is in breach of Resolution 1441 , it is not fully cooperating with the inspectors , nor is it coming clean .
The Commission will , however , ensure coherence of the common fisheries policy with environmental objectives .
Europe has to negotiate from a position of strength in this global regime .
The Commission is endeav@@ ouring to prevent similar delays occurring in the future .
Mr Flynn , if you hold your breath for too long you will do yourself an injury and then you might need the health card .
Therefore we must recognise that there are widely different opinions honestly held in this House .
Before the House is invited to vote on the recommendation on the Energy Community Treaty tomorrow , we need some answers and assurances from the Council on these points , and I and others will be listening carefully .
A negotiated solution may still eventually be reached following the WTO rulings , but at this point in time the Commission has to protect the interests of Airbus against Boeing .
I would like to thank you very much and to wish you success after this remarkable beginning .
With regard to emissions by ships I would like to recall the very significant agreement that has just been reached within IMO on SO@@ x and on NO@@ x .
Secondly , awareness can lead to a greater understanding of the symptoms and , consequently , early diagnosis .
We cannot just put it off .

Fourthly , I will never underestimate the issue of integration capacity .
I found that I could not continue to read .
When we are certain that the goods are coming from settlements , duties are applied immediately by Member States .
Mr President , the Commissioner said that he felt che@@ ated by the Government of Cyprus .
Mr President , I have not met many people who are not in favour of the protection of natural , architec@@ tural or cultural heritage .

Georgia , under the Western @-@ oriented reform@@ ist President Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , has suffered considerably from Russia &apos; s heavy @-@ han@@ de@@ dness .
I felt that a period of two months was too long ; I felt that a period of one month was too long ; I felt that a period of two weeks was appropriate .
So it is not enough simply to spend more : we need to spend better , especially on key requirements such as strategic air@@ lift , precis@@ ion guided weapons and air tankers .
The suspicion amongst many in the United Kingdom is that these issues and the high @-@ minded pron@@ oun@@ cements are yet another power play by ste@@ alth on the part of the EU and its institutions .
Now I want to turn to the second major proposal for discussion today with important implications for food safety .
We must wait and see whether 2003 is an ann@@ us mi@@ rab@@ ili@@ s or an ann@@ us horri@@ b@@ ili@@ s for the European Union , but since we are now in the Year of the Go@@ at , I would congratulate the Greek Presidency on its ten@@ acity , persistence and determination in pushing through its agenda .
That is rather fragile .
Could we have a better target ?
All Quartet partners should be able to contribute .
Member of the Commission . - The only thing I can say at the moment is to stress our full determination to go ahead .

I must say that we are also extremely concerned with the so @-@ called bad governance which has been noted by some of our embassies and delegations in Kenya .
I say &apos; astonishing &apos; because the vast number of applicants in my constituency have passed through several safe countries prior to their arrival there .

It is obvious that even the biggest Member States cannot tackle climate change , energy security or mass migration alone .
For more than a year now the Sudanese authorities have refused to hand over these individuals and are thus obstruc@@ ting the work of the International Court .
It will dominate us in the 21st century .
We are often lec@@ tured by certain Council members on the need for transparency , so they themselves should be open to providing information on their expenditure .
In order to be effective in the region we need the trust of ordinary citizens .
70 % of Zimbabwe is about agriculture and the economy is being destroyed .
The Commission is very much concerned about the risk of Somalia returning to war and to chaos .
The Commission is following the developments regarding App@@ le &apos; s commercial policies and is in close contact with the national competition authorities .
Cap@@ s on emission rights : for me , 95 % .
I would like to thank Mr Dimit@@ rak@@ opoulos for his question and for the follow @-@ up question .
It is , in fact , that latter perspective that emphasises that in certain sectors , where too many producers produce too many products , some kind of management tools to control supply are necessary and in the interests of the majority .
He will know that Chile participated actively in the preparatory work on the Statute of the International Criminal Court .

Could the Commissioner tell me whether the Standing Committee on Fo@@ od@@ stuffs discussed the combination of energy drinks with alcoholic products and , if so , what research did it propose and what information did it think was needed ?
We have to be careful that , in dealing with these new technologies , we do not design a system like that of the man with the red flag who tries to block the advances of the car .
I hope the Commissioner will tonight confirm her agreement with the UN Commissioner for Human Rights that her office in Colombia retain the double mandate , including monitoring , not restricting its duties to simply technical assistance .
However , Mozambique is Ireland &apos; s biggest destination for development aid money and the reason is that the Irish Government works very closely with the Clinton Foundation in tackling disease , including AIDS , as well as giving education on the ground .
President of the Commission . - I am aware of that report of the European Climate Foundation and , indeed , under the 2020 strategy , we have proposed a resource @-@ efficient Europe flagship initiative whose aim is precisely to decou@@ ple growth from resources , giving Europe a competitive advantage compared to other international partners .
While we might know what is in the financial envelope , it is not good enough .
This directive sets out a new framework for working , for the first time , together in an integrated manner to protect our seas and oceans .
That is certainly what its young population deserves and that is , as Ms Be@@ er said , why it is important to keep open the links so that the other Iran , as it was described - the more open Iranian society to which speakers have addressed themselves today - can welcome the efforts which are being made to maintain that dialogue , certainly by the Commission and by others .
In this context the Commission is in a position to accept a large number of amendments , some of them in their entirety , but also a large number partially or in principle and with adap@@ tations .
This would put our political dialogue on hold and inter@@ rupt our development programmes to the detriment of the poor people in Cambodia .

I just wanted to say that the way you have conducted the business today has been to your credit .
However , it is interesting and intri@@ gu@@ ing - and a number of Members have made reference to this - that we are indeed now talking about a dual majority system .
I am happy to see that the Commission and Parliament share the same views on the overall objectives of eco @-@ labelling schemes , on the principles and features that credible schemes should contain , and on the need to address properly a complex and currently rather an@@ arch@@ ic reality .
I saw a report at one time which said that we could increase the catch from European waters by 50 % if we would apply the conservation measures necessary .
We should not forget that , even when macro @-@ economic crises are over , employment levels may remain low .
Dru@@ gs , for example , are wasted if not accompanied by adequate storage , distribution , monitoring and patient education .
My real fear is that we are going to end up with a highly capit@@ alised banking system , while the real economy is on floor .
Nevertheless , there is more to it than that : partnership with countries of origin and transit , a policy of sustainable return for illegal immigrants and the fight against undeclared work are all essential in this regard .
Why is the family looking for justice here ?
We have been one of the driving forces behind the activ@@ ation of the G20 Summit process which was raised , as you know , to leaders &apos; level last November on the initiative of President Barroso and President Sarkozy , but we are not the only ones that are needed .

Within this framework we will aim to help the Moroccan authorities to better organise legal migration .
The policies of the EU establishment mean a nightmare for the ordinary people of these countries - the threat of barbaric conditions for the ordinary people .
This is high on our agenda in the framework of our Motor@@ ways of the Sea programme .
Here the Commission limits itself to ensuring compatibility with competition and internal market rules in general . Those rules , as emphasised by the Langen report , are quite flexible .
You will see from the resolution that we have also called upon Member States in particular to declare their support for it and to put the necessary resources behind that very important project .
It was generally understood that any ferry travelling through international waters outside the 12 @-@ mile limit and any airline travelling in international airspace would continue to benefit from and be able to continue with duty @-@ free sales after 1 July 1999 .
How far have we got ?
There are 26 so @-@ called fragile states in the world as we speak and the most vulnerable people in the world are facing catastrophic consequences , not through their own fault in some cases , but sometimes through bad governance , sometimes through internal conflict , sometimes through civil wars , sometimes through geno@@ ci@@ dal dictators as we found , not many years ago , in Sierra Leone and Liberia .
Clearly all European agriculture is not going to become completely organic .
As we have already stated , we will take subsidiarity into account .
The competent national authorities are free to make their own decisions on pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals , provided that these decisions are made in a transparent manner and do not create barriers to trade .
That is why we need a different legal basis and a panel of experts broa@@ dened to include independent scientific experts on public health and food safety .
I am not saying it is going to be easy .
There are also some safety requirements for eye protection at work in the Directive on the Safety in the Work@@ place but none yet for private use .
It is clear that the EU is facing new competitive challenges on the world market , challenges which cause anxiety and uncertainty for our industry , our workers and our consumers .
Mr President , I have to clear up a confusion about the point of order I raised earlier .
A few years ago we had the Russian @-@ Ukrainian crisis , and we are still batt@@ ling with that .
On 1 April - a few days before the next informal Ecofin - Mr McCreevy will go to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
Nevertheless , they are given trade preferences .
But I would , in so doing , like to thank the Commissioner for his positive contribution to this very issue .
Furthermore , European consumers have , on several occasions , expressed their wish not to have food products from cl@@ ones or the off@@ spring there@@ of on their table .
It is true that we are proud of the progress we have made so far , but what is the outcome in terms of overall emission reductions ?
E@@ vi@@ dence of flights that have been linked to the CIA is not evidence of rendition , still less evidence of mis@@ treatment .
It is not a compromise that British Conservatives are particularly pleased with and I was proud to vote against EU ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ance .
The next sitting is , in fact , today - the first occasion when we can deal with the matter .
We do not want our money spent on promoting it either in the UK or elsewhere .
These are not clearly protected in many European states , nor are they in some states which are candidates for accession .
Nor is it within sole EU control .
So we feel that we should back this new approach and hope that it will really come about .
This contribution is crucial for the Maurit@@ anian national budget considering , as I said earlier , that annual payments under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement represent 15 to 20 % of the country &apos; s budget .
This is the agenda Labour and the Li@@ b D@@ ems support .
Out@@ side the context of the review of the Code of Conduct , we have made progress in areas such as outreach .
I have the document of this report in which it says that the committee voted it .
Second , a subject which has been touched on in , for example , technical terms by my honourable friend , Mr Deva : the question of allocation of financial resources between Latin America and Asia The Commission proposal seeks to respect , for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 , the broad 60 / 40 balance of appropriations for Asia and Latin America which has prev@@ ailed during the previous financial perspectives .
However , it gave the impression that the guarantee was only for Members of this House .
Mr President , Gaza is a prison camp for 1.3 million Palestinians , se@@ aled tight by Israel .
I would once again like to thank Mr Riv@@ ell@@ ini for the report and the committee for its efforts regarding this important issue .

K@@ ey initiatives , particularly in justice and home affairs , are often hampered by the absence of qualified majority voting and they end in stalemate .
There are issues to be borne in mind to ensure that it works well .
I believe that they should be included for several reasons , but the main one is again that they can under@@ cut the other hauliers , and this will have tremendous health and safety implications .
It will contain a number of concrete cooperation measures , especially between our customs services and embassies in selected third countries .
The most important thing is that we in the Committee on Budgets were united in using all the legal possibilities that we have to fill up the margin almost in each heading , which means that any vote which gives additional money is ris@@ king the legality of the budget .
In relation to flav@@ ourings , the proposal offers high protection for the consumer while allowing the industry to continue to develop new flav@@ ourings and new applications , in order to respond to the increasing consumer demand for more convenient foods .
The same applies to the automotive industry and , therefore , although the general regime allows this kind of compensation for transport , it is not allowed for sectors such as steel and the automotive industry .
What I hope will happen as a result of this is that we will ensure that airlines do not hold on to slo@@ ts unnecessarily .
Mr President , these successes of Europe would have been impossible without the cooperation between peoples that you and this Parliament have delivered .
Some@@ body tell me why this Parliament , which has done all in its power to support the trans @-@ European network project is now being told that because the governments of the Union want the trans @-@ European networks , but want their money as well , we here must slas@@ h the budget for education and training , job creation and consumer protection .
That will help to prevent the recurr@@ ence of such acts as the murder of Robert McCartney .
Mr President , this debate once again demonstrates the limitations of urgencies , with huge numbers of representations because there has been insufficient time for proper negotiation and consultation .
We talk on the phone , we also meet inform@@ ally , and I see this troika mission , because of its timing and visibility , as a way of clarifying the seriousness of the moment .
Moreover , as an insurance against potential production risks , in March 2001 the ECB decided to establish a Eurosystem central reserve . This reserve will amount to about 10 % of the launch and logistical stocks taken together .
In my view , payments made in good faith on the day of insolvency proceedings being opened should still be protected .
While containing both favourable and un@@ favourable elements , the report provides a good , solid basis for a reform package .
If Objective 1 status was accorded to the mid@@ land region , it would develop as a region on the back of the infrastructural improvements such as the Port@@ la@@ o@@ ise byp@@ ass , so as to attract more investment and create more jobs .
The results have been available on the website of Manchester University since 2003 , with suggestions for adjustment whenever imbalances have been revealed , both domes@@ tically or in third countries .
Mr President , the development of an integrated maritime policy is of vital importance to the Irish , the European and indeed the global economy .

In the extraordinary circumstances we made an extraordinary call to the Bank , and it responded immediately by accelerating its lending to record high@@ s .
My opinion includes an amendment replacing the management committee with a consultative committee in order to enable the Commission to exercise more adequately its responsibility for implementing the budget .
However , we should not over@@ look the fact that the Community has been hugely successful in achieving its current status on foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease , at least up to a couple of weeks ago .
It is therefore extremely difficult to use it in cross @-@ border trade .
We are looking further into this and welcome any proposals from Member States on how such funds may be operated in accordance with competition rules .
Firstly , of course , at the level of ICT products themselves .
The committee also recommends a revised definition of the GSP + vulnerability criterion , which would make Pakistan eligible .
I am not quite sure that is the correct use of language because it seems to be an abuse of language to call it a statement of assurance .
If we can get this balance right we could be at the beginning of a much needed renewal of the railways , we could be instrumental in giving the railways back the priority that they deserve .
We also need to strengthen the role of social measures within the cohesion policy in order to address the changing democratic situation .
Mr President , do I understand correctly that the Commissioner is not accepting any amendment which has been proposed by Parliament ?
I understand - unless the Commission can contradict me this evening - that the Commission may have to apply for an extension of the deadline .
We have limited our work to ensure that we can contribute to this informed and factual debate on the Constitution .
In his state of the union address , President Bush displayed a shocking bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ence .
In Z@@ am@@ bia the department of health then estimated that half the population would die of AIDS .
Similarly , it is not good enough to say it is entirely up to Member States to make changes and implement the guidelines .
The G8 countries have engaged with the World Bank and other development banks to improve the har@@ n@@ essing of funding for clean technology and , crucially , they also agreed to begin a new dialogue between the G8 and other countries with significant energy needs on climate change , clean energy and sustainable development .
Firstly , concerning micro @-@ supervision : I do see that the proposed moral there , which would still be based very much on cooperation instead of a centralised European aspect , has very serious problems .
The presidency has , on several occasions , urged Member States to speed up their rati@@ fications .
For some small businesses this will mean improving access to finance and maxim@@ ising their opportunities in the single market , but for many the answer will simply be for politicians to cut down on red tape and interference .
It would be easier for us to focus on the supply side and the difficulties caused by Hurri@@ cane Kat@@ rin@@ a , but if we did that we would just be applying a sticking pla@@ ster , when what we really need is major sur@@ ger@@ y .
in writing . I voted against this report , as amended , because I believe it still leaves our national health services at risk from cre@@ eping liberalisation and legal uncertainty .
in writing . - Ser@@ gi@@ a Bel@@ ato &apos; s report on the Community Tobacco Fund seeks to reopen the debate on extending tobacco subsidies until 2012 .
Perhaps I can explain what was going on in London and why they came to a Conservative Member of the European Parliament rather than go to a Labour MEP , or indeed to himself .
We need , therefore , to strive for simpler and more common rules and practices to promote consumer confidence in cross @-@ border transactions .
I am proud of the fact that this report was conducted and concluded under the European Year of the L@@ ung .
I believe Member States must address themselves to the fact that there must be better coherence but we need the flexibility to ensure that we are getting the right areas for state aid and Objective 2 .
The British writ@@ er , Franc@@ is B@@ ac@@ on , observed that hope makes a very good break@@ fast but a rather poor sup@@ per .
The areas that are controversial and worrying have been dealt with , I am pleased to say , and the result is a strong , defining directive that will strengthen Member State positions in healthcare .
If it is proposed under that a@@ eg@@ is it stands a good chance of being eligible .
Mr President , I am sorry to prolong this discussion , but may I build on what was just said by my colleagues , Mrs Doyle and Mrs Frassoni ?
I know that there are other views in Parliament , but I submit it to Parliament for consideration .

It was not a campaign of con@@ quer .
The last speaker addressed some of the points that I would wish to make .
This imminent war is also about human rights and democracy in Iraq .
Indeed , as you are probably aware , many animals have already been destroyed .
We may not have accepted all their proposals but I want to assure them that we have considered everything very thoroughly indeed and we want to thank them for their contribution and for working with us .
Mr Tony Blair is a war criminal .
Enlargement in the wrong circumstances will certainly halt progress and will probably reverse it .
It is in areas like this that I believe it is good to see cooperation across European states .
They tell me that they have been in touch with the Commission and the reason is that this is not the responsibility of Commissioner Schreyer but of Mr Prodi .
However , especially at a time of economic uncertainty , I think it is all the more important to ensure that the relationship between Europe and Russia works as effectively as possible to deliver security , stability and prosperity for our citizens and also for Russia &apos; s citizens .
That is not possible if he is not here .

In between a previous colonial occupation and taking this post with the European Commission , I wrote a book and made some television programmes about Asia and I remember visiting Indonesia shortly after the riots there in 1998 and inter@@ viewing the then President Hab@@ ib@@ ie .
This brings me to Amendment No 1 .
Given the fact that there have been over twenty deaths and almost one thousand recorded cases of the disease in Hong Kong , it is appropriate that the report should refer to this problem .
About 40 % are expected to involve intermediaries investing in Europe and about 60 % in Central and Eastern Europe .
I am convinced that by this unprecedented violation of the territorial integrity of a neighbouring country , and by anne@@ xing parts of its territory , the Russian Federation has lost the moral and political justification to host the 2014 So@@ chi Olympics .
Despite this , the communication sends a clear message , that the cross @-@ border provision of investment services to professional investors should already be subject to home country conduct @-@ of @-@ business rules alone .
The cost is EUR 160 billion , or 2 % of the EU &quot; s GDP .
The political debate raised the question whether we should intervene in the new economy or not and I will make just a political point .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , people may think that I will speak in Italian , and people might want to make this an Italian debate , but I am Dutch .
I am aware of the difficulties , as I said , being expressed by these lec@@ turers , some of whom are from my own country , who have made representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs , the Minister for Education and myself .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am really very pleased to be here today to discuss with you the very important issues raised in the Green Paper on the review of the consumer acquis .
This radical departure has its origins in the compelling argument that there is a maritime dimension to virtually every major issue facing Europe today - energy , climate change , innovation , international competitiveness , job creation , environmental protection , trade , transport and so on .
You will be distre@@ ssed , however , that these crazy fol@@ k have fallen f@@ oul of the law of unintended consequences .
I am convinced that the agreement will provide many benefits to patients in the European Union , and that it constitutes another important step in guaranteeing European patients &apos; rights .
in writing . - According to the report , the EU has a unique combination of economic dynamism with a social model .
Firstly , EU research will be centr@@ ally coordinated , will enable the development of feasible products , and will introduce these into the marketplace .
This idea has been played around with by many of our partners and many important figures in the international community .
El@@ se@@ where , it be@@ mo@@ ans the fact that Europe has an ageing population .
Yes , there will be some measures to c@@ us@@ hion the impact of this factor in some of our industries , because we want , of course , to protect the economy of Europe and we want to protect our jobs in Europe .
This is certainly a source of concern .
Without that , all the rest of it is just talk .
in writing . - First and foremost , Europe must devote its efforts to help its members in their quest for the search of oil and gas .
I would like to use this time once again to ask all Member States and European institutions to work more actively on the mechanisms of European energy solidarity .

Therefore , Romanian and Bulgarian friends , you enter a Parliament with no vi@@ vi@@ d debates and a planned cor@@ on@@ ation of our next President .
The Commission deeply deplores and condemns this situation and calls all parties in the conflict to respect humanitarian law and principles .
I sincerely hope the Commission will back our amendment , despite what the Commissioner just said , and help us convince the Council that something must be done .
I am ple@@ ading for professional realism as to how we evaluate these things .
My Group would therefore support that move .
What is Commissioner Bonino doing about that ?
Within this context I fully support , for example , the return of the Le@@ wis ch@@ ess@@ men to a location in the Western Is@@ les of Scotland and , likewise , the St N@@ in@@ ian &apos; s Isle treas@@ ure to Shetland .
Much as I love Strasbourg , coming here twice in October for two five @-@ day sessions is a waste of our time and energy .
It is legitimate that we might expect that two to three questions would be asked from each Commissioner .
I do not agree with all of his report .
Why should we accept a retro@@ grade move to allow one or more governments to preserve what is , frankly , an unfair system ?
He has been unable or unwilling to reign in terrorist suicide bombers , including his own Fatah al @-@ A@@ q@@ sa Mart@@ yr@@ s Bri@@ ga@@ de .
I find it difficult to operate a video properly , and I usually have to get my son to show me how to work it , but that is very simple technology compared to the Internet .
We must keep that proposal solid , because if we fail , if we say terrorism is OK if it is in the Middle East , but not if it is in the United States or Europe , then we are making a mistake for which we will suffer .
It must also protect cultural , linguistic and national diversi@@ ties .
I hope it will be the source of many badly needed jobs in all our Member States .
Rem@@ a@@ ining obstacles call for a policy response , and that is why we still need policies geared towards gender , both at national and European level .
It should be noted that for every animal str@@ anded , many hundreds more are killed or severely injured but we never get to know about them because they never reach the shores .
Although the common position places firm controls on permitted emissions from waste incinerators , I know that whenever proposals to build such an inciner@@ ator are made in my country , people rise in protest , they dis@@ trust the operator &apos; s claims and I have a degree of sympathy with them .
Having said that , I feel it should be noted that the recommendation in the related matter concerning the payments system , adopted in 1988 , is being violated in virtually every Member State of the European Community , and this does not give us grounds for confidence .
There is a general issue about security , which I know the High Representative is addressing and rightly so .
We have arrived at the final question .
There is no way these reactors will get the green light for prolon@@ ging their work time .
G@@ et on with it , if you can raise the money !
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse , as it did in 1987 .
I hope that we make progress and I look forward , like everybody else in this Parliament , to the day when set @-@ aside will be a thing of the past .
How did such contamination occur in the first place when nitro@@ fen has been banned in the EU since 1988 ?

I am sure I speak for all in this Parliament when I say that the European Parliament stands ready to do all it can to support Pakistan in difficult times to allow it to grow and support it as fully functioning and peaceful democracy .
Could I call on the Commission to spon@@ sor , through the framework programmes perhaps , some additional and specific research , not only on the causes of hi@@ ve collapse but also on possible remedies ?
Will it lead to corpus jur@@ is ?
in writing . - I fully support the re @-@ election Mr Nik@@ i@@ for@@ os Diamandouros to the office of European Ombudsman .
We need to make a determined effort to gain added value for our European project .
So it troub@@ les me to hear you accept the fact that Brazil has lower standards of traceability than we do because it might not create such a disease risk coming into the territory of the European Union .
Such action could also give encouragement for the organisation of opposition forces .
An@@ archy reig@@ ns in our international institutions , and that only provides comfort to Saddam Hussein .
Human Rights Watch and Islamic Re@@ lief have told me that the three @-@ hour daily pause is simply wo@@ e@@ fully inadequate to get in and to distribute aid .
We also want to integrate support for conflict prevention into our engagement and dialogue with the rest of the world .
It is an attempt to th@@ wart that democratic imp@@ ul@@ se in Iran that we are seeing at the moment .
To Mr Allister and others , I would say that we are not pre@@ judging the ratification of the Constitution .
The fact that the European Union has devoted very considerable funds to enable the comprehensive land reform bill to be carried out underlines the importance which we have put upon it .
I should first like to take the opportunity to thank you and your services very much for the prompt response that you referred to .
That is what the network is : everyone working for the one central authority - the Commission .
This will include same @-@ sex unions , meaning that partners in same @-@ sex unions can act as next of kin in case of accidents abroad and , where appropriate , have equal rights to tax benefits while living or working in another Member State .
In the field of trade policy , the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance , known as &apos; GSP + &quot; , provides additional benefits for countries that implement , , certain international standards in human and social rights ; so it is a positive incentive .
I wish Commissioner Reding well in getting on with this problem .
So what is the way ahead ?
Also , there is a f@@ law in the oral question , namely that the study would have to be completed by June of this year .
This directive can therefore be seen as one of the basic instruments for an integrated product policy , where the whole life cycle of a product will be taken into consideration and eco @-@ design will be promoted .
- Mr President , since you invite me - and I have been provoked by colleagues - what is the point in running an assembly which indicates that votes are due to take place at 12 noon , but which then start at 12.@@ 40 p.m. ?
With great difficulty , unless we make some radical changes .
I also agree that we have to struggle within the places where people work . Therefore it is important that we actually give shop ste@@ wards and workers &apos; representatives these tools to sort out the problems prior to them going to court .
A modest adjustment will be made to the existing provisions in relation to the veterinary controls to take this particular system into account .
This earthquake is a tragic reminder that natural disasters are a continu@@ al threat for all Member States .
I demand that the EU stop boosting the Naz@@ ar@@ ba@@ yev dictatorship .
To conclude , enlargement was always going to be a long @-@ term effort and one which has to ride out political stor@@ ms in Ankara , Belgrade , Brussels and many other capitals in Europe .
I regret to say that my own Member State , the UK , is one of those which has &apos; reservations &apos; about this ; and some members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs feared that perhaps the UK or others might tor@@ pe@@ do this report .
How does this mar@@ ry with the idea of the single market ?
I wish to support all the amendments on the ra@@ m@@ p and the pigs , because I have watched the horror of trying to get pigs into a lorry .
How many more Palestinians have to be arrested , imprisoned and tortured before the EU stops just talking about human rights and starts taking action to defend them ?
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the ECR Group strongly supports European enlargement .

This is why these objectives are part of the Stockholm Programme comprehensive framework for EU action on the citizens , justice , security and migration policy for the next five years .

I acknowledge your concerns about the lack of experience with the Lamfalussy approach hitherto .
It is not authorised for sale in the European Union .
So not only do I believe that we adopted the right course of action with the good results that came from that , but I also firmly believe that we are not in any delay as a result of taking that particular course of action .
The ECR agrees with the priorities of the 2011 budget as stated by the rapporteur - youth , education and mobility - but , if we take these goals seriously , it lo@@ gically follows that what our young people need is definitely not a greater fiscal burden in the age of adverse demogra@@ phi@@ cs , but more solidarity and investment in our common future .
It is time they were called to account and I am glad that there will be stronger supervision for these bodies .

The next step will be to extend the joint register to all the EU institutions and to convince the Commission and Council to make it mandatory .
The appointment must be by open process and must involve the European Parliament .
With the deal that has now been agreed , the necessary information will not be available .
Whatever they say about having had to vote for the report as a whole at the end in the committee , it does not persuade me that some committee members did not also have concerns about the effects of some of those amendments .
But this legislation will concern all e @-@ mails which will go in future to mobile termin@@ als .
Last month , Liu X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o was sentenced to 11 years &apos; imprisonment .
My country does not have such a post .
It is , of course , a supplementary instrument to the others at the disposal of the Commission .
So I want to see this agenda being driven forward .
In general in the field of so @-@ called &apos; red biotechnology &apos; , which is connected to pharmaceutical industries , perhaps the situation is slightly better .
Subject : Pro@@ mot@@ ing sustainable energy in cities
So my question to the Minister is : Is the Presidency going to ensure that we get agreement at that meeting , or are you going to drop the ball ?
However , I can promise that I will duly inform my colleague and , if he thinks it appropriate , then he will certainly start an investigation into the matter .
We are calling for smart sanctions that would directly hit Mugabe , his family and his c@@ ron@@ ies .
We need to remain focused on toy safety , market surveillance and the prevention of the use of hazardous substances in products specifically designed for children .
No payments were made by the Commission directly to farmers either in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland , because there is no legal base for such compensation .
But that will inevitably create problems during the next year and I think that some time after Parliament &apos; s first reading we will need to have discussions with the Council and the Commission to see how we can address that situation .
He used hunger strikes to protest and to challenge the lack of freedom of speech in Cuba , carrying the hopes of all those who care for freedom , human rights and democracy .
This will allow Parliament a full say in the final content of the legislation which of course I greatly welcome .
If we are to work constructively together we must review together our policy priorities , and reassess the way in which the transatlantic partnership functions .
The Council approach towards Cuba was set out in the common position of 1996 , which has since been evaluated by the Council on an annual basis .
We can help star@@ ve him of funds , which is as important a task as the military operation which we know will soon follow .
I am grateful for the brie@@ fin@@ gs we have had and which have been useful .
We need a holistic approach that meets our international obligations and the needs of those we aim to protect .
If so , is this unequal treatment of European produc@@ tions acceptable in the light of the task of promoting cultural diversity in the EU pursuant to Article 151 of the EU Treaty ?
That is why I called then for a debate in the EU about a boycott of the Olympics .
They made it clear that they did not feel that their concerns about the implementation of the Uruguay Round had been met and therefore they were not prepared to go any further .
The Commission has set out its views on a strategy in the region in its communication &apos; Black Sea synergy - a new regional cooperation initiative &apos; .
The different structure you propose makes a lot of sense , but I think this is the way to ensure we can have a real political debate about priorities .
Let us pause for a reality check .
I mainly want to speak on the issue of the Ass@@ yri@@ ans .
It is much more political , and we are very worried about the independence of the Court of Auditors in relation to the requirements set down by the Committee on Budgets , so I do hope that will be considered .
This phenomenon is of great concern since it may not only increase and strengthen tensions between the country of origin and country of destination but also between the country of origin and a country of transition .
Our proposals have been the 1967 borders with appropriate sw@@ apping of territory , which is for the parties to agree and not for us to say , but I am sure that would take into account the reality of people &apos; s lives and where they live .
If you were a troub@@ les@@ ome criti@@ c of the regime , you would not be put on trial .
Let us hope its advances move us forward faster , and conver@@ t cyn@@ icism into renewed belief .
The Council wishes to maintain and deepen relations with Albania .
Mr President , the reports drawn up by Mr Albertini and Mr Dan@@ je@@ an are very important documents coming at a crucial moment : the Lisbon Treaty has just entered into force , the EU has a new Parliament and transatlantic cooperation looks more promising .
On this basis , the PSE Group can support this proposal , which will be put to the vote tomorrow morning .
I would like to see some attempt throughout the EU to coordinate activity .
The European Ge@@ ost@@ ationary N@@ avi@@ gation Over@@ lay Service ( EG@@ NO@@ S ) is ten times more accurate than GPS and it is predicted that accuracy to 45 c@@ enti@@ metres can be achieved in the near future .
Also , the actual emissions that we have now should be taken into full account .
Kazakhstan is travelling the road from a Soviet re@@ public to an independent and democratic state .
I say to Mrs Jensen that this is still very much in the body of the report .
Mr President , I have listened carefully to the speeches of the distinguished Members of the European Parliament and I appreciate the positive and constructive contributions and the well @-@ intentioned criticisms .
Meanwhile , the Commission confirms that the funding foreseen for the planned EU election observer mission will remain committed until December 2003 .
It is a chance for Parliament to fill some political space and to bring a focus to the period of reflection .
Energy is on the agenda , and our side should make clear that we cannot tolerate a dispute between Russia and Georgia evolving into a European gas crisis in the dep@@ ths of winter .
I believe that the internal market is about workers ; it is about workers &apos; rights ; it is about health and safety ; it is about living conditions ; it is about elderly people ; it is about young people ; it is about disabled people ; it is about employment and unemployment ; it is about the training of young , old and unemployed people .
I supported this compromise package which will ensure the motor industry is forced to produce gre@@ ener and cleaner cars which will help to reduce pollution .
Economic growth can only come from enterprise and education , but education and enterprise can only come if there are the instruments to create economic growth .
I agree as well about the strong relationship transatlan@@ tically with the United States .
This is important for the political debate in general .
This is the first step in the process .
This outbreak demonstrates the importance of cross @-@ border cooperation in the field of preventive health .
We have made it very clear , and I want to repeat this point today , that we will be ready to come forward with substantial assistance for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as soon as a political agreement is reached between the parties .
Finally let me turn to the Declaration itself .
There are many more questions which are raised by this case and are touched on in the report .
Unfortunately , they are not very nice words .
If the Commission would like to come and look at my farm , it has been far@@ med for 3 000 years before Chr@@ ist was born , and continues to be far@@ med .
Firstly it provides increased premiums for only certain people , those involved in Morocco .
It should not be included in the surplus .
I agree that is very important , but when it goes on to say that it urges the Commission to examine the need for the creation of a European coastguard body to assist in parallel these regions and the Member States in monitoring the EU &apos; s external borders , I think that is far too wide a remit .
Also , can the Council representative tell us what he feels about the rapid reaction force and whether this is going to be brought forward so that emergency flood def@@ ences could be brought into affected areas ?
In conclusion , the EU has to be an inspiration to the rest of the world .
This may not be politically correct thinking , but we have to ask where the values lie .
Revision of the Treaty : you know what was the position of the Commission .
We need to see progress on the part of the Council .
Mr O &apos; Neachtain expressed reservations and concerns about Ireland and other peripheral countries .
I urge the EU institutions to redouble efforts and use all tools of diplomacy and cooperation assistance available to them to work towards the abolition of the death penalty
That is why we need to speak with those who have responsibility .
But enhanced cooperation is also needed globally .
I would also like to thank the Commission , the Council and the secretariat .
Let us move on from here and look towards the future .
I voted against the budget resolution because it breaches the 1 % limit on gross domestic product .
The current treaties already provide a way ; and if the Council wishes to add to that the spirit of Amsterdam , then we can proceed to an interim Commission appointment through that means .
We are developing a good record in disbur@@ sing this assistance , having paid more than EUR 200 million into the United Nations and World Bank trust funds over the course of the past year .
Although all the Member States have ratified the Convention , its implementation varies widely and the views of the Member States on how to best protect children &apos; s rights diver@@ ge to a considerable extent .
I think of Burma - on which I shall speak tomorrow - and Zimbabwe , where millions of people are suffering under Mugabe &apos; s tyranny , a situation shame@@ fully tolerated and encouraged by leaders in some African countries in the region .
That is to be welcomed and it will enable our farmers to plan .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - Madam President , the negotiations for the EU @-@ Canada trade agreement have been driven by major European and Canadian multinationals who want market access to vital public services so that they can profit at the expense of workers and consumers .
This is a defining period in anch@@ oring Russia firmly in the community of democratic nations .
Therefore , I just want to say that access to emergency services , fewer barriers to swit@@ ching operators in one day , privacy , where personal data is concerned - all this has found a solution .
Mr President , obviously we welcome this report because it serves to harmon@@ ize driving licences and develop a system of codes which can be easily understood by all authorities throughout the EU .
Prime Minister Vanhanen repeated the European Union &apos; s concern at the murder of Anna Politkovskaya , expressed so eloquently in our previous debate in the European Parliament .
One of your key aims was successful enlargement of the European Union .
I very much welcome it on behalf of my group and , I hope , the whole Parliament .

Council presidents must remember that they are not taking over executive office when they become president of the Council .
We gave you a brief in March 2000 .
Econom@@ ics , however , is not an exact science and it is not just about numbers .
How do you see our relations improving in that direction ?
Mr President , I would like to say a few words about risks and possibilities .
New legal acts will be required and all that takes time .
They have to be comprehensive and because they are comprehensive - because we have a huge mandate - they will be somewhat complex and they will not be finished soon .
It is hard to over@@ emphasise how important the Camp David acc@@ ords are to Israel &apos; s security .
It would save money on health services . How many billion euros are spent on health services trying to save the lives of people who try to kill themselves with cigarettes ?
Building this new par@@ adig@@ m for a Neighbourhood Policy brings with it the necessity to change the Eastern policy in the same direction .
Otherwise world prosperity will be seriously threatened in the longer term .
President Santer and I will be having talks with the new Prime Minister of Slovakia Mr D@@ zur@@ in@@ da .
I find it somewhat ironic that we refer to the common foreign and security policy .

The Maltese in particular have been very good at survi@@ ving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments .
Com@@ ple@@ x or not , the petitioners have a right to know why European Union rules for the regulation of Lloyd &apos; s were not properly implemented .
The report adds a further building block to Parliament &apos; s remarkable work in assessing the EU to@@ ol@@ box on human rights , through its regular annual reports , the A@@ gno@@ let@@ to report on human rights clauses , the study of the European Inter @-@ University Centre on the impact of Parliament &apos; s activities in the field of human rights , as well as the study on the guidelines on torture .
My second reason is , as we have seen in the recent past with the conflict in Iraq , the instability with regard to the price of oil , and the effect that it can have on the economies here in Europe that are so dependent on fossil fuels .
The Kurds have been betra@@ yed so often , but this time we must guarantee their freedom and identity .
It is extremely important .
In these circumstances it seems only appropriate that those vessel owners who benefit from third @-@ country agreements should take on a fairer share of the financial burden involved .
Do you not think it would be a good idea to have a Northern Dimension as the overarching concept , but a Baltic Sea strategy as an underlying theme working within the Northern Dimension ?
In this way , European Union structural policies will have a greater impact on reducing regional and social disparities .
I particularly like the reference that we are a continent of liberty and , above all , of diversity .
Technical research is complemented by socio @-@ economic studies and demonstration .
Can I ask you , within the next year , to look at Mr Tajani &apos; s paper , look at Mr Barnier &apos; s paper and assure us that this is the right thing to do ?
It was very important for us to ensure that we have legal clarity if we want to introduce a new system covering biodiversity , because traditional damage - economic damage or damage to people - is already well covered by the legislation in all Member States .
The Commission is happy to agree with all these amendments .
I welcome the Brussels Summit decision to allow the European Union to present negotiating positions to the candidate countries on all outstanding issues by early November .
It is absolute madness to expect anything from a piece of paper signed by Putin , any more than we would from one signed by Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler .
They do not a prior@@ i pose a threat to global financial markets or the European economy ; rather they are very beneficial to it .
The waste is shi@@ pped through the Irish Sea , thus making it the most radioactive body of water in the world .
Here we will have a lot of work in the next few months .
This is an excellent way in which to begin the century .
I deplore the cynical Green exploitation and mis@@ representation of the situation .
But let us look at one small issue and how this report could affect it : let us take a look at ink @-@ j@@ et prin@@ ter car@@ tri@@ dges , probably one of the most widely used products in the world .
Instead they should remember the free C@@ ze@@ chs and Pol@@ es who helped my country free the continent of Europe from another similar tyranny six@@ ty years ago .
Although I speak today on behalf of the Presidency rather than the British Government , I would simply point out at this stage , as a serving minister in the British Foreign Office , that to date the E@@ 3 process has been a powerful affir@@ mation of that approach , whereby a coordinated approach has been secured across Europe , which has strengthened our hand in the important and difficult discussions that have had to take place directly with Iran in recent months .
The proposed directive &apos; on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation , procurement , testing , storage and distribution of human tissues and cells &apos; is a very important piece of legislation and much to be welcomed .
Because the dates are crucial .
There is no time now to go into all the details of Parliament &apos; s reports or , indeed , of the internal market strategy .
The greatest service all in this House can do is call on the LTTE to lay down its arms and to release the civil population from its grip .
Why is it that at the moment the EP@@ O uses the system of many experts instead of the system of one expert , which is in use in Japan and the United States ?
It is a recipe for a bureaucratic nightmare with zero safety gains .
Many Members mentioned prudential supervision and the necessity to improve the situation , I would certainly echo what many Members have said .
The results include new consumer rights , such as the right to switch phone operators in one working day , the establishment of a European telecoms authority , more interdependence for national telecom regulators , measures to ensure that Europeans can be connected to broadband Internet , the opening of radio spectrum for use by new wi@@ reless services , the new instrument of functional separation to boost competition and broaden consumer choice , a clear pro @-@ competitive rule for investment in high @-@ speed broadband networks , better rights and new guarantees for consumers , mechanisms to address data breaches , and so on and so forth .
Each day , we realise that they are not adapted to the new challenges , new opportunities and new threats of today &apos; s world .
In this context , it is very bad news that , on Friday 2 January 2009 , President K@@ ib@@ aki signed the Kenya Communic@@ ations ( Amendment ) Bill 2008 , which amen@@ ds the Kenya Communic@@ ations Act of 1998 .
One is the question of balance between ecological commitment and the need to reduce our greenhouse gases and , at the same time , the need to address fears that exist in some parts of our industry regarding some effects on international competition .
We in the Budgets Committee especially through the work of Mrs Dührkop , who has worked in a very assi@@ duous way have tried to seek an agreement on these reports .
So , in the Commission &apos; s view , what has been achieved in the high @-@ level group provides , at this stage , no more than a good basis for further discussion .
I shall be abstain@@ ing .
Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the European Private Company Statute .
The Financial Regulation must also contain a job description .
The significance of the D@@ U@@ P &apos; s I@@ an Paisley &apos; s conditional &apos; yes &apos; to power @-@ sharing with Irish nation@@ alists and re@@ public@@ ans should not be underestimated .
in writing . - The Ombudsman offers an important service to Irish citizens .
Taking the long @-@ term view in the context of Agenda 2000 , we must ensure that family farms and their individual enterprises are supported within the available budget resources .
I believe that it sends out the wrong signal , at a time when public confidence in Europe is suffering , and that the common agricultural policy is damaged by any mention of cofinancing .
The Commission , however , wants to forge ahead with this .
With regard to classi@@ fications for coastal waters , we support the distinction between it and fresh waters , as coastal waters have lower per@@ missible levels of contamination than those for inland waters .
The ECB is the only major central bank which makes possible immediate interaction with the media .
A key goal of the 12@@ th EU @-@ China Summit , to be held on 30 November in N@@ an@@ jing , will precisely be to work together to ensure success for the Copenhagen climate summit and to address EU @-@ China relations , including human rights , the financial and economic crisis and other international issues .
In addition , the Commission was informed extensively on the matter by the European Confederation of Police .
With 300 soil types in Europe , only 9 Member States with national legislation in place , and the challenge of climate change before us , there is added value in an even @-@ handed EU approach in addressing the international challenges caused by deforestation and decline in water quality , serious soil erosion , floods and land@@ sli@@ des and ensuring safe food production .
It is thus possible to set thresholds for GM presence in non @-@ GM var@@ ieties through a comitology procedure .
in writing . - I would like to welcome the report of Mr. Stav@@ rak@@ akis on the increased effectiveness between ERDF and other structural funds .
South @-@ East Asia deserves our full attention .
The only feasible third party would be a team of international observers .
This is specifically a problem in the Mediterranean countries .
I do not consider this a ballot issue , as some might portra@@ y .
This work must be done in the safest possible conditions .
Within the framework of the 2006 recovery plan for eastern bluefin tuna , and on the basis of an evaluation of its implementation during the 2006 , 2007 and 2008 fishing seas@@ ons , and in the light of new scientific advice , ICCAT decided to adopt a new recovery plan .
As a Member of the European Parliament and a frequent user of mobile phones , I stand to gain a great deal from this legislation .
I believe that young farmers can link into food production , they can link into nich@@ e markets , and they can produce the type of food in the regions that we want and really link into the market place .
How surprising !
That agreement should then serve to provide the allocation scale for any future similar agreements .
Food has never been cheaper than it has been in the last few years .
The Green Tourism Business Scheme is operated on behalf of Vis@@ it Scotland by a commercial - though not @-@ for @-@ profit - company .
I will not talk about the law itself ; I will rather use the example of one of my favourite writ@@ ers , a great Hungarian writ@@ er , Sán@@ dor M@@ á@@ rai .
Comp@@ are Fl@@ ori@@ da , Tex@@ as , Al@@ as@@ ka , M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota and C@@ alifor@@ n@@ ia ; they are very different wor@@ l@@ ds .
That is a statement in an authorised interview in de Volk@@ sk@@ rant of 7 October 2009 .
Techn@@ ically it is possible , but it may be expensive , both for the consumers and for the environment , with sharp rises in energy consumption of up to 40 % .
In the Republic of Ireland we have been fortunate so far in that the outbreak has been confined to one area close to the border with Northern Ireland .
Is the Council aware of the situation in Britain to which I have referred ?
We must harmonise measures relating to the single market .
To Mr Paasilinna I would just point out that while we are concerned about these issues it is worth noting that Russia exports about 40 % of its total exports to the European Union ; that the European Union exports about 3 % of its total to Russia ; and that Russia has a EUR 10 billion trade surplus with the European Union .
The day of landfill sites is now coming to an end and they must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies .
Whilst Security Council reform is naturally an issue of great importance , it must not be allowed to st@@ all the whole process of vital reform of other UN institutions or other important areas where progress is needed .
I do not think we do a more important thing than cast our votes for and against proposals in this House and objec@@ ting to that is a very foolish thing .
Quality guarantees are what consumers deserve and what they need , and stand@@ ardi@@ zation could deliver just that .
This was said yesterday .
While I could approve some individuals , others I would vote against .
Considering that the net cost has been of this order every year , it is staggering just how much of our national resources we have p@@ oured into the black hole of Europe .
What Objective 2 funding we had has been reduced by the present government and the Con@@ ver Fund that used to be very helpful is now being phased out .
We would have wished those words to have more of an effect than they already have , but that is often the case .
In relation to the election in January , I hope that the Government will pursue and continue to prepare for that election , and will make it possible for Ms Benazir Bhutto to campaign in a secure fashion .
I want to ask the Commissioner for information about exactly which NGOs he is referring to and I would also like to know whether any contact has been made with those NGOs during the last six months .
As an individual however , I must say that I believe that the functions set out by the committee should be fulfilled either by an existing suitable body or by a new organisation .
This is not the business of the EU .
I would therefore draw to her attention a report by the British Health and Safety Executive about the safety of the D@@ oun@@ re@@ ay nuclear installation where it says that the team ( Health and Safety Executive ) found many chronic safety problems and , in the fuel cycle area , conditions ran@@ ged from the good to the very bad .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - Madam President , as we all know and can read every day , the Arctic is increasing in importance , and it deserves greater attention from the European Union as well .
The rapporteur has worked hard and I am therefore particularly sorry to say that my Liberal Group cannot unfortunately support most of his amendments .
There is no doubt that the European Union is finally understanding that the problems faced by Malta and other Mediterranean countries affected by the immigration phenomenon will ultimately become a problem of Europe as a whole .
Roma have become partners !
I think it is very timely , and it will certainly be welcomed by everyone , because most people would welcome a reduction in inspection .
During this fighting , thousands of innocent people were killed and injured and much destruction to property , infrastructure and the environment has been caused .
As we know , binding agreement was reached in the form of the Doha Declaration , paragraph 6 of which highlighted the difficult issue of WTO members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector , who could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS agreement .
Nor do we have any competence to take any particular steps or to make a stand on an individual level in these particular cases .
However , we still need more progress if we are to begin a new era in our relationship and if we are also to confirm the suspension .
Once again , we see that the EU , as it seeks to take powers from Member States , even in matters of policing , has a very strange idea of democratic legitimacy .
Mr President , like many others , I want to thank Commissioner Byrne for his customary vigilance and also the French Minister for being here today .
The issue is of fundamental importance for the correct functioning of the European single market and I would like to thank colleagues for raising the subject this time given the number of cases the Commission has referred to the Court of Justice over recent years .
Their application should become a rule , not an object of political bargaining .
Thousands of cyber attacks are committed daily against European Union institutions and other public authorities .
We must ensure that it is properly targeted towards sustainable political and physical reconstruction .
The effort is of course led by my colleague , Commissioner Diamantopoulou , but it is an endeavour in which all of us as Commissioners wish to be fully involved .
As you know , the proposal was articul@@ ated on three main issues .
Wa@@ ys of strengthening the entrepreneurial , technical and vocational dimensions of second level curriculum must also receive particular attention in the context of assisting SMEs in the future .
One of the issues of importance you have raised today is how we will proceed with the Green Paper , which will be adopted by the Commission in September .
There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca , who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate .
S@@ mar@@ t C@@ ities are planned for the following year .
It is a treaty in form , but a constitution in substance .
Those who know me will be very much aware that I have vigorously supported collective agreements in the Member State I know best .
Like Mrs Ewing , I think that it should be peripheral airports because if we look at the question of the lower limit which the EPP voted for in committee this would mean that small airports like those which Mr Hume , Mrs Ewing , and Mr Ger@@ ry Collins use would each be covered by the legislation ; these are all very small airports and yet they are vital to the economy of their regions .
The proposals before us , passed after long deliber@@ ation by a large majority of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , have several ingredients .
Any self @-@ respecting democrat knows that you do not need a title , you do not need to be a human rights defender , and you do not need to be a member of M@@ em@@ orial or a Sakharov awar@@ de@@ e to have the democratic right to criticise any head of State or Government .
There are restrictions on freedom of expression , with widespread censorship of the internet and the press - even the former speaker of parliament and presidential candidate , Mr Kar@@ ro@@ ub@@ i , could not get authorisation to broadcast his new television channel from Dub@@ ai .
I have two specific questions to which perhaps you might reply .
The reality is that in Chechnya itself we are working with 170 000 internally displaced people , the same number in Ossetia and the small number of 20 000 in D@@ ag@@ hest@@ an .
I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to reply to Mr van den Bo@@ s on anti @-@ personnel mines today .
Please give us a free economy .
However , it does clarify the organic operator &apos; s responsibility for avoiding the presence of GMOs .
The price of pigs has continued to decrease for over a year and for several months now , has been clearly below the production cost .
We must develop the southern corridor and should consider the White Stream project , in addition to the Nabucco project , as a priority , but also with trans @-@ Caspian and even trans @-@ Saharan routes as exciting future prospects for the European Union .
Nevertheless , he remains popular , particularly in the rural areas and among the older generation no@@ stal@@ gic for the security of the US@@ SR in these uncertain economic times .
I would strongly urge the President to agree that we can vote on those amendments , and I encourage members to give their full support .
The answer is &quot; no &quot; .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the Kelly Report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning EU financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland ( IFI ) .
We welcome the Commission &apos; s proposal to remove this exclusion and to change this anomaly , and we hope that the Commission &apos; s proposal is ratified by the Council , not the one as amended here this morning .
I would like the Commissioner to reassure me that , when the campaign is decentralised , information offices in the Member States will involve Members of the European Parliament in the information campaign as a matter of course .
With regard to the developing countries , I agree about the importance of assisting developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change .
Why was the number of casualties so high ?
It has been revealed for what it is , which is an authoritarian conspi@@ racy against the people .
To take another example , port state control .
This is dict@@ ated by our firm conviction on the matter , the need to act quickly and the fact that some EU Member States have already proceeded with national bans .
Today , in the EU , they have no obligation whatsoever as regards either research or even mi@@ xing in some renewables with what they sell to motor@@ ists .
I should like you to ask the Bureau and the presidency to give us in this House , as soon as possible , a comparison of the proposed personnel reforms in this parliamentary institution with the reforms proposed in the Commission .
Y el men@@ sa@@ je que de@@ be@@ mo@@ s man@@ dar de est@@ a C@@ á@@ mar@@ a es sim@@ ple@@ mente a los terror@@ ist@@ as que no pas@@ ar@@ án nun@@ ca j@@ am@@ ás . &#91; This Spanish phrase is very well known in my country &quot; ¡ No pas@@ ar@@ án ! &quot;
We urge the Iranian authorities to respond positively to our appeals in order that we can proceed to a positive dialogue , which can only be to the benefit of Europe and Iran , and of peace and understanding between our peoples .
These are very much needed and have been a strengthening of the regulation .
Secondly , in my view as rapporteur , it is essential that the programme remains market @-@ driven .
It will be very difficult in any circumstances to launch massive new programmes in Iraq and in the neighbourhood of Iraq .
The Commission has expressed concerns about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan .
We can see , for example in the US , that we have bans for under @-@ thre@@ es on some toys and we have warnings for over @-@ six @-@ year @-@ olds ; they complain that they are importing our dangerous toys from the European market , so perhaps we need to follow the US model in this area .
That is the way that we will deliver the jobs and growth that this economy desperately needs .
This means doubling on a yearly basis regardless of the duration of FP7 .
I just wish to clarify something you said .
We received no reply to that letter .
Of course I think that attention should also be paid to the substance and questions which you underlined .
We ought to focus more on improving the quality of the proposals that we put forward , ensuring that they respond to the demands and needs of the peoples of Europe , and more importantly , ensure that they lay down a solid foundation for the future development of economic prosperity , of stability and of sustainability .
It took the church until 1992 to agree that Galileo had been right .
The people of Israel also live in a situation of insecurity .
The reason is often that the young teen@@ ager is discoura@@ ged from learning by the rigi@@ dities of an education system that sticks to established lines and tries to fit square pe@@ gs into round hol@@ es .
If an airport , for instance , is located in the centre of a city , then the limit values that should be acceptable there are completely different to those at an airport located out on a pen@@ insula in a quiet rural area .
He is absolutely right to reject the 10 % across the board crude reduction in development lines .
in writing . - In my opinion , a Single Market for Europeans should also mean a Single Market of quality .
I know the Commission is dealing a lot with this , but we also have to look at how we get the Sa@@ par@@ d funds into enlargement states to help them build up their infrastructure , including their education systems .
I do not want to see a repeat of the Can@@ cu@@ n round of WTO talks , which was a lost opportunity and , indeed , set progress back in this regard by at least two years .
I welcome Parliament &apos; s support for strengthening the Commission &apos; s enforcement powers in the future IGC .
I hope there is a chance , because - as I said earlier - there are journalists who have been admitted now , so hopefully our European Community will be there .

I have personally been involved in Europe &apos; s support for UNHCR for UN aids .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , it was a fascinating debate .
Mr President , maybe we should question whether or not we might have achieved more if this measure had been introduced to improve the fuel efficiency of commercial vehicles rather than to reduce CO2 .
I think after the very comprehensive and good report by Mrs G@@ y@@ ő@@ ri , representing the Hungarian Presidency , I will not now elaborate on the issues regarding Libya and the southern Mediterranean .

On 31 December 2009 , President Lul@@ a &apos; s last day in office , he refused to extradi@@ te Bat@@ ti@@ st@@ i to Italy .
In this context , education , agricultural development , visa facilitation or , ide@@ ally , liberalisation , must be at the top of the agenda .
While this report had some negative elements , such as its call for a delay of the Trade Defence Instrument Review and the un@@ precise nature of the language on liberalisation ( which has opened up the possibility that certain aspects of liberalisation may be negotiated upon which were controversial at the WTO level ) , I felt on balance it was a report to be supported .
I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4 .

The Court has said we do not have to pay the money back .
Instead of looking at the billion @-@ dollar projects and silver @-@ bul@@ let solutions , we need to get back to the nu@@ ts and bol@@ ts of what makes a successful economy .

Madam President , I want to draw the attention of the House in particular to paragraph 8 which calls for the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indi@@ genous Pe@@ oples at the level of the UN Commission on Human Rights as agreed by all parties involved , including indigenous peoples .
in writing . - Labour Euro MPs are fundamentally opposed to the current , austerity @-@ only , direction of the economic governance package .

Madam President , unlike Mr Perry , I have no problem whatsoever with people demonstrating for their rights .

I must say that the timing of Mo@@ o@@ dy &apos; s decision is both surprising and highly unfortunate , coming after the agreement on a macro @-@ economic adjustment programme between Greece and the Commission , the ECB and the IMF .
In conclusion , I would like to insist on the importance of ensuring high waste @-@ recycling rates and improved resource efficiency in the extraction sector .
There is an expectation and a hope that this support should rise in view of that situation .

Some people may say it is not important but most people feel , as we know ourselves in terms of civil rights and terminology , that language really does matter in this area .
I would observe that I was elected under a Labour ticket - not a New Labour ticket - when John Smith and Margaret Be@@ ck@@ ett were leaders of the party , and elected by two @-@ thirds of my party members locally , unlike the Labour MEPs for next year who will be selected by Mr Blair personally . So , I would claim to have a far stronger democratic mandate than they will have .

Many citizens will not accept this as the constitution of the EU and if referenda are held , as they must be in some states , I believe there will be no majority for a constitution promoting nuclear technology .
Our contacts with the national parliaments will also help .
The budget is not the appropriate instrument for such policy decisions , regardless of how one might feel about the issue .
I am therefore especially concerned about the massive deal struck between Guinea and Chinese companies , and I hope that the Commission and Council will express to Beijing our expectations that its business activities there should neither provoke internal stri@@ fe nor further undermine human rights in Guinea .
I know from your remarks that you agree with that .
Nevertheless , clearly Moldova is not the same as Morocco .
I agree totally with everything you have said - my congratulations ; just make sure that it is implemented .

I would also like to know why when Rule 126 with the request to suspend the sitting was raised , it was not immediately taken and put to the vote ; and why , when Rule 101 ( 3 ) was abused by the people in the gallery , not only disrup@@ ting the dignity of this House but then continuing to conduct television inter@@ views in the gallery and make telephone calls on mobile phones which are strictly illegal in this building , you did not immediately evi@@ ct them before the vote was taken under Rule 101 ( 3 ) .

I am convinced that , if this plan is fully respected , it represents a realistic chance for the gradual recovery of bluefin tuna .
Fine @-@ tun@@ ing the legislation will , of course , be a long process for us , but I still think that the compromise we have achieved will probably be adopted in a future document and is a great opening .

The Commission &apos; s proposal would have denied the less advantaged and lower@@ - income groups from access to credit .
So there is a real need for better cooperation , and to exchange information .

Our response has been to point out that whilst we recognise the need to ensure consistency with the social and economic policy on employment and ageing which we , in the Commission , advocate , we also empha@@ tically require proper account to be taken of some basic facts about the employment age profile of the European Union civil service , which are of great relevance to any consideration of pension parameters .

Turkey &apos; s application has to be judged on the basis of the following criteria : Turkey &apos; s strategic geographic and economic position and how this impacts on Europe ; Turkey &apos; s crucial role as a member of NATO and how this membership could be sustained if the door is permanently shut in its face ; Turkey , which as a future responsible member of the EU could be the fire ex@@ tingu@@ is@@ her for the fires of dis@@ content that burn in the Middle East and beyond .

Thirdly , it should aim to upgrade the combating of climate change to establish a good context for the reform of the common agricultural policy and the construction of a common energy policy .

As a result , over the last few years , we have witnessed a marked improvement .

The crisis in the financial sector has led to more collateral and higher @-@ risk premiums , which means it has become much more difficult to get start @-@ up credits and other financial resources .
I can therefore accept the following amendments without reservation : Amendments Nos 2 , 3 , 7 to 10 ; Amendment No 9 as corrected by Amendment No 50 ; Nos 18 to 30 , 35 , 36 , 40 and 42 . These are welcome rein@@ for@@ cements and real clarifications of the proposal .
