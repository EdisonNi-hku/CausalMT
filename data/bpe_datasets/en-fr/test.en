I believe my colleagues will also come forward with issues .
Therefore while the plurality of the media is obviously an important subject , it is not covered by the current Treaty .
I am personally committed to the objective of ensuring better regulation within the EU .
In this season of goodwill , I am prepared to go along with the proposals .
My additional question is : what is the position of the Council in this regard ?
I am sorry he is not here for the final session .
Now the Commission says that the farmers must re@@ pay this money which prevented cruelty to animals .
Mr President , that the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) is deplorable and that the effect of the conflict upon the people there is tragic goes without saying .
Mr President , I just think that it is important to ...
This was the underlying objective of the Commission Communication on Network and Information Security , which proposed a number of measures , such as awareness @-@ raising actions and improved exchange of information mechanisms .
Well , the British Government did not endorse or commend him .
Here , it is very clear that we need complete transparency in the market , which is why the third regulation package really addresses the separation of transmission activities from the supply activities .
Finally , on the Roma , whose condition was mentioned by several speakers , the Commission is seeking to bring more coherence to its support for Roma communities .
I bit@@ terly regret that .
The Commissioner touched on two points that I wanted to bring up : first of all , with regard to the Nu@@ tri@@ tion and Health Group that is meeting with regard to types of food and di@@ etary conditions , but also with regard to false advertising by many people involved in saying that sport is linked to certain types of products and additives , which can be very harmful to health .
One of these problems is how we dispose of our waste .
This action clearly in@@ furi@@ ated the Cu@@ bans .
But we can hear the e@@ gg@@ shells cra@@ cking as the Commission tries to edge forward on this and we urge the Commission to be really brave and really lead on this issue .
So I welcome the emphasis on removing the restrictions on the investment of pension fund portfolios and support the objective of removing barriers to labour mobility .
Or@@ din@@ arily , a paed@@ ophi@@ lia@@ c rap@@ ist would get life imprisonment in most countries , but a UN paed@@ ophi@@ lia@@ c rap@@ ist would probably merely be discipl@@ ined , or would just be excluded from again being hi@@ red by UN missions .
I do not think that we have reached such a situation in any of our Member States . But - and it is very interesting - the article states that the European Parliament itself has the possibility to activate Article 7 of the EU Treaty .
Above all , they should be targeted more effectively .
We will gather enough scientific evidence to be able to convince even those who are reluctant at this stage .
This is indeed disappointing , but not a surprising decision , given the situation in the country .
. Mr President , I thank the honourable Members for their comments on the Commission statement .
On a point of order , I interrupt the rapporteur to say that I am extremely pleased that you are the first Member to start using that procedure .
Mr Sil@@ ves@@ tr@@ is , are you applau@@ ding me or are you asking for a point of order during the explanations of votes ?
I trust the honourable Members have noticed the same strong focus on fundamental human rights and universal values in the recent Commission communication and in the Council conclusions on China .
They want help with new technology .
Perhaps they can find it out now .
However , we do not hold out too much hope of conver@@ ting this whole exercise into something which could be really positive in turning back the tide of legislative bureaucracy and over @-@ regulation , and genuinely protecting the human rights of the citizens of Europe .
There are several sources of tension in the Horn of Africa .
One of the ways to ensure that women are liber@@ ated , have rights and know their rights , is through a proper education system .
Prime Minister , thank you for your speech and for your presence .
In other words : add value and not take over as an excuse of competence .
Mr President , we should not turn a blind eye to blatant human rights violations taking place in the three countries .
The same is true of public health because we have this system in place .
They maintain that rules of national contract law are not a factor in influencing consumer attitudes to buying from another Member State ; in fact , there are other genuine barriers to cross @-@ border trade , such as administrative and cultural differences and a lack of effective means of redress for consumers .
While it is not possible to be in full agreement on all issues - friends very sel@@ dom are , and a sign of mature friendship is that they can differ even on significant issues - it is important that any differences that exist are managed in a way which avoids damaging the overall relationship .
It is then ship@@ ped back and sold below domestic prices .
The development of the single market will not be affected if we fail to link up the telecommunications , energy and transport networks .
But to do this they died a tragic and desperate death because as Europeans we failed to come up with common and workable procedures for asylum and immigration and that must be on all our consciences .
I am totally in favour of labelling of origin , but I think we have to be very clear about what we mean by labelling of origin .
I am sorry that we were unable to reach a full compromise agreement on the central issue here - the only one which I have time to address .
I also welcome the commitment to extend the scope of codecision .
Mr President , I have a similar , short question .
We were the first organisation to enter into a cooperation and assistance agreement with the Court in 2006 , and we give the ICC full political and diplomatic support with démarches , political dialogues and statements .
Key to it are digital tacho@@ grap@@ hs , and key to the success of that was having a much more realistic deadline than the original one .
This investigation tool is a serious instrument that should be deployed when the situation justifies it , but launching an investigation is not a step to be taken lightly as it may impact on our wider relationship with the partner countries .
I hope that the European Union Member State governments do not share that view but rather subscribe to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to the idea that there will be no bilateral negotiations with any of our neighbours .
First of all , Mr President I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary of State , M@@ o M@@ ow@@ la@@ m , and to Foreign Minister , David Andrews , for the very important personal contribution they both have made to the negotiations which have led to the peace agreement .
This debate should involve national parliaments and the European Parliament as well as the Member States in Council and the Commission .
I want to stress that our purpose in these negotiations is to boost commerce , because trade drives inter @-@ economic growth .
Others have turned to non @-@ state players .
Signifi@@ cantly reducing emissions will require a whole range of policies and measures .
The emergence of a multi @-@ polar world dicta@@ tes the need for a new definition of modalities for cooperation between the two sides on all existing bilateral and global issues .
Tradi@@ tionally , this policy has been focused on mitigation inside and outside the Union .
However , we need to be aware that the problem is very much harder for certain poor countries in the South , like Bangladesh and the Philippines , which have been in@@ duced by the World Bank and other donors to invest heavily in exporting clothing and appare@@ l products and now find themselves with shr@@ inking export opportunities , a continuous debt burden , no financial means for adjustment of the sector , and misery - especially for millions of women who work for almost nothing in night@@ shifts in order to undercut the cheapest offer on the market with an even cheaper one .
Subject : Partnership agreements with developing countries
But because we want to ensure that we are properly recycling electrical goods , we want to close the loophole which is leading to so many electrical goods ending up in developing nations , being taken apart by children on bon@@ fires and dum@@ ps .
It is also urgent to develop a regional protection programme encompassing Egypt , Libya and Tunisia .
The textile sector is likely to be only the first sector among many .
It is very easy in the external field , perhaps more than any other , to make grand@@ il@@ o@@ quent statements about Great Issues such as peace in the Middle East , a stable and productive relationship with Russia , international development .
We are holding meetings at all levels and our missions are very often to Greece .
Otherwise world prosperity will be seriously threatened in the longer term .
We are also aware that there are many areas where such consultation is already being advocated , in the temporary agency work directive for example , and in a whole range of other areas relating to family @-@ friendly work , quality of work , modernisation of work , organisation , active ageing policies and so on . So we are also hoping that this new approach will be able to look at the qualitative aspects of growth and employment , which are all too often forgotten , and the social repercussions as a whole .
This legislation is a fascinating case study for anyone interested in the institutional decision @-@ making processes of the European Parliament .
The fact is that we need legislation to implement what is called for in the motion put forward by the three main political groups tonight : high minimum standards for the safe and reliable design , construction and operation of nuclear and nuclear @-@ related installations , as well as for nuclear @-@ safety management systems .
Nigeria is one of the most gi@@ fted countries on earth in terms of natural and mineral resources , including oil .
If I choose to spend 10 hours on a be@@ ach on Saturday or Sunday , or 10 hours in the gar@@ den at 80 degrees exposed to the sun , or on the golf course in very hot sunshine , all the health authorities would say that it was far too long .
I voted against the joint resolution due to elements it contains which have been consistently opposed by the UK Conservative Party .
I congratulate the Commission , with Romania &apos; s people , the primary architects of the country &apos; s success , for bringing her to that level of integration today .
I have a freedom to work ; I have a freedom to use the national healthcare system or whatever .
The Commission launched its public health operations facility on 24 April and since then my services have been at permanent operational level .
Not since Camp David have I perceived us to be any closer than I feel we are today to the beginning of real , meaningful communication and exchange and therefore the beginning of a political horizon , and a debate and negotiations about that .
That is why I am pleased that the international community as a whole , through the UN Security Council , has made its position clear : that the violence is unacceptable ; it must stop and people should be held to account .
Djibouti is expected to be conges@@ ted with the arrival of 600 000 metric tonnes over the next three months .
We are talking about how we are going to work together .
We should not seek to stop those changes .
We have asked for this before .
Let us not interfere in any way with the principle of local self @-@ government .
That paves the way for an even more rigorous assessment , which will accompany the Commission &apos; s consideration and agreement on the proposals that it wishes to submit to Member States on the basis of the review .
One of the possible solutions to deal with the so @-@ called car@@ ou@@ sel fraud in this sector would be to apply the reverse charge mechanism .
All these factors along the production chain are involved .
Allow me to underline once again that the Commission counts on the support of the European Parliament in order to help the countries and populations in need .
While I appreciate that Britain will not be one of these countries , it is nonetheless important that all countries , even those not participating in the single currency from day one , should be actively involved in the preparatory and planning phases for the launch of the euro because of the potential impact of this currency on all our economies , whether inside or outside the single currency zone .
As the Committee of Independent Experts pointed out last year , most of the irregularities highlighted by the committee stem from decisions approved by the financial control@@ ler , that the supposed quality guarantee provided by the approval is a myth and put forward two strong arguments for changing the system .
We live in an age where terror seems to know no bounds .
I hope that all three will carry equal weight .
In my opinion , from the mid 1990s until 2000 the Equitable Life Assurance Society over @-@ bon@@ used its with @-@ profit policies , which showed on paper at least that Equitable Life had the best results of all major assurance companies , thus encouraging people to take Equitable Life policies out .
So it is urgent for us to show solidarity in the strongest possible way , in order to defend those people who help those who cannot help themselves .
I assure you that the report and today &quot; s debate will provide valuable input in shaping the strategic guidelines for cohesion .
I suggest to you that in 2008 by far the single most important thing you can do is to make sure that the Single Market for Services Directive is properly implemented in all Member States .
Our general policy however , is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society , something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America .
Indeed , such is his and our party &apos; s respect for democracy that we would like to see referenda in the 26 countries that have so far been denied them .
Consequently , it cannot support the amendment that would remove the derogation for small magne@@ si@@ um dy@@ e @-@ ca@@ sters using less than 500 kg per annum .
Nevertheless , we will try to coordinate the Member States and at least make sure that they take all the necessary steps for the sake of their individual citizens and European citizens in general .
Mr President , unlike some of the previous speakers , I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino .
I remember when we tried to change it before : Mrs D@@ ury put forward a long report from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities and there was a great deal of debate and discussion by Members .
In this framework , the Presidency would like to recall that Member States remain , in the first instance , responsible for designing and implementing the employment policies .
We have condemned the crackdown , the violence and the use of force that we have seen against peaceful demonstrations ; we condemn the crackdown against journalists , media outlets , communications and protestors .
We have identified a significant number of those obstacles , which , we must all agree is astonishing , given the fact that it is nearly 10 years since the internal market was established .
The substance of change , namely putting into action the reform programme of Commissioner Santer , is essential .
We now have legislation at European level and the framework decision on racism and xenophobia , which will be a key tool to tackle the racism that Roma people suffer from .
Sta@@ ging posts allow animals to be un@@ loaded , watered and res@@ ted , and also the essential cleaning and re@@ be@@ dding of trucks .
First , when the vote was being prepared in the AFET Committee , all political groups agreed to use in this report only one term for the state which calls itself the Republic of Macedonia .
If we succeeded , it is due in part to the unity of purpose demonstrated by the various institutions .
The agreement is one of the most ambitious partnership agreements that the EU has ever concluded with a third country .
I would like to say to him that it is not through lack of effort on our part that it has taken a long time to get this question on the agenda .
The Commission and the Council communication and conclusions on external action will build upon the external dimension of the EU strategy on the rights of the child .
Those people have distan@@ ced themselves from what you have written in your report and indeed would distance themselves from your statement today .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . - Madam President , the global economic recession changed the economic landscape in the EU dramatically : it increased unemployment , reduced economic growth and impaired the business environment .
I would draw the attention of both the Commission and the House to the fact that three Member State governments are clearly against the application of this directive .
We have to really work much more towards fulfilling those objectives .
Do not forget that it was passed in this Parliament by a simple majority , not by a qualified majority .
We are talking about better law @-@ making .
Like honourable Members , I welcome the United States &apos; efforts that have relaun@@ ched the Syrian / Israeli negotiations , despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today . There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future .
I am very glad that he is not as ill as he looked , but we must have re@@ suscit@@ ative equipment in the House , given not only the conditions but some of our ages and I include myself in that .
Furthermore , with regard to data retention , I am often dismayed at the way this House takes such an absolu@@ tist rather than a balanced approach to civil liberties .
As co @-@ legislator and the EU &apos; s only directly elected institution , Parliament needs to be kept informed about the developments of these systems , as it has requested many times in the past .
However , I should like to focus the Commission &apos; s mind on another issue .
By joining forces with Germany in the way it did , France has alien@@ ated America , undermined the UN , sent the wrong signals - signals of division - to Baghdad and exposed the im@@ possibility of ever achieving a single foreign and security policy .
This is a right that we give them - this extra right to have an informed choice and decide for themselves where they go for their health treatment .
It has worked well for the past 15 years and should continue to work well in the future .
A positive vote will be a vote for ending cruelty .
I hope that you and the College of Quaestors will take this seriously because it is an encro@@ ach@@ ment on the right of Members to come to this House and vote freely on issues that their electors have sent them here to debate .
In@@ side Iraq there is much solidarity with the Iranians in exile .
I asked why the Council waited for two years , until the very last moment , to decide on this deal , and I would also like to know - and we can get the answer in writing - why the national parliaments have been completely excluded from the whole procedure .
We are joined in our concerns by them as well .
Small budget lines with a very minor critical mass are actually impossible to execute in the way which would be efficient .
The Portuguese Presidency submitted a draft Council regulation at the end of June 2000 .
I have recently visited Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic where I have underlined the necessity to be vigilant in regard to the risk of BSE .
Mr President , I think this is the right day to reflect on the importance of elections and observation missions .
Everybody agrees on that and what I am doing now is following normal procedures , to the extent that we have such a thing in the Commission .
Under a bilateral agreement , the Commission sent a team of five EU experts , who were joined by representatives of the Commission and the UN Environment Programme .
There have been consistent improvements across the board with regard to respect for human rights .
My colleague has already mentioned this .
While both sides have cause for complaint , I am afraid that what we find in this question is naked anti @-@ Ameri@@ c@@ anism and a petty , little European mentality .
I believe the rapporteur would also like the floor .
This definition reflects too broad an understanding of the notion of circum@@ vention .
They allow monitoring of short @-@ term trends in the labour market and help to assess the business cycle .
I do not want the President @-@ in @-@ Office to think that I am alar@@ mist but the reality is that the EU has only two weeks to prepare an appropriate response which can ensure that the essential elements of the trade components of the negotiations are concluded and ready for discussion in Coreper the following week .
In addition , the European Group on E@@ thi@@ cs in Science and New Technolo@@ gies is working on an opinion on the ethics of nanom@@ e@@ dic@@ ine , which we expect to be delivered to President Barroso soon .
Quite the contrary : the European Council of June 2005 forcefully resta@@ ted its support for the Millennium Development Goals with ambitious commitments on both the quality and the quantity of aid .
The policy of concluding separate deals with separate countries has led to serious inconsistencies , and I can confirm to those who do not know the Joint Parliamentary Assembly ( JPA ) , and who do not have as much contact with parliamentarians in the ACP as I and others in this room have , that it has created really very difficult situations and severely damaged the cohesion that I perceived amongst the ACP in the past .
I should jol@@ ly well hope so !
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I very much welcome what the Minister has said this morning , and hope that much of it will be echoed by the Council , although the evidence so far does not give us great cause for confidence that it will .
We should also be concerned about the actions of some Europeans .
The total ban on mercury instruments destroys a long @-@ standing craft industry in the UK and is the product of obs@@ essive meddling by Brussels in matters far beyond what is necessary or sensible .
At this meeting the Council adopted a declaration on the European Union response to those terrible bombings .
I also welcome the fact that the WWF and Greenpeace are supporting and promoting the agreement on the International Dol@@ phin Conservation Programme because it is a legally binding instrument that consoli@@ dates the results of an effort of interested governments , the tuna industry and the environmental community that , in less than 20 years , has led to a dramatic reduction of the mortality of dolphins in the Eastern Pacific Ocean .
I will be very honest with you on this point .
Whereas condemnation has gre@@ eted Russia &apos; s effective annex@@ ation of parts of the sovereign state of Georgia , even the tone from within the EU has varied .
British Conservatives are abstaining on this resolution .
But even the British East India company had social corpo@@ ra@@ tive responsibility : they built schools ; they clean@@ ed up Beng@@ al ; they built railways ; they put infrastructure in and they created offset investments .
Member States will have some flexibility in choosing what information is required in each country , but I am glad to say that many of them are going for less data than originally planned .
Whether a report deals with tax structures - which is the case here - or tax levels , it is not a competence of the European Union and these discussions should not , in my opinion , be taking place here .
What we therefore have is a thoroughly unsatisfactory proposal .
We also need to ensure that there are adequate resources in place .
I am grateful to colleagues for their cooperation on this very important resolution .
Specifically , it is time for the seven European Union countries which have not yet done so , including the Belgian Presidency , to ratify and implement the UN Convention for the suppression of terrorist financing , so that the black money networks which sustain terrorist organisations can be closed down .
Mr President , in the light of the serious allegations concerning the rent and purchase by the European Parliament of two buildings in Strasbourg , this House must emphasise that it is taking immediate steps to investigate these allegations in a prompt , rigorous and transparent manner .
In addition the Commission has , in its recommendations , addressed concerns in Europe relating to Turkey &apos; s accession - for example concerns about the budgetary impact , or about the free movement of workers .
Due to the time constraints , I will leave it at that and not ask the Minister to give me a response in view of Mr Fitzsimons &apos; interest .
I think you have already noticed that there is always a strong voice from the Commission side highlighting the need to keep an adequate level of financing for research and innovation in the educational sectors , because we believe this is how we will preserve and improve our competitive edge and prepare our future researchers , our future workers in highly competitive areas for better performance in the future .
I continue to believe a negotiated solution is the way forward , and we will stay engaged and have another envoys meeting later this month .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Si@@ fun@@ akis and Mr Ber@@ lingu@@ er for this wonderful initiative .
Mr President , for many years prior to the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990 , development was held back by border wars between the two states and bitter internal strugg@@ les which periodi@@ cally fla@@ red into civil war .
For instance , if a cloned bu@@ ll is worth EUR 1 000 at the end of its life to go into the food chain , then the people who have bred that bu@@ ll have to put up a bond , which may be worth EUR 3 000 , and when they destroy that animal and make sure that it does not go into the food chain , they get the bond back .
It will be available for the Council on 3 and 4 June .
They have taken out the vehicle registration number which was there originally so that the card now relates to a person and not just one vehicle .
S@@ itting up there are brave people who have come to see us today and I hope I have the chance to meet them .
That would apply to the workplace , but it would be a first step .
Mr President , I speak in two capacities , first on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . Their rapporteur , Mr Ri@@ poll y Martínez de Be@@ do@@ ya , unfortunately cannot be with us this evening .
All of this is highly innovative and no EU proposal has ever pushed the boat out so far in favour of performers .
This legislation will ensure a level playing field for operators across the single market .
If you want to know just what we can contribute as a Community , look at the multitude of our operations in the Balkans .
Firstly , to remind all of us who are fit and active today that tomorrow we could find ourselves in a wheel@@ chair .
There was a joint statement at that time moving forward .
The fifth element is finalisation of the work on the future of the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) and on strengthening the European Financial Stability Facility ( EF@@ SF ) , building on the agreement in the Eurogroup Plus ministerial meeting on 21 March , and you all know that the terms of reference of the European Stability Mechanism mention the fact that information will be provided to Parliament . I was especially pleased about that .
The data protection authorities have the same view , but they are being ignored .
Many of the amendments contained in the committee &apos; s report are technical in nature .
I have real concerns regarding the way in which what actually happens in this House is being distorted by some sections of Pakistan &apos; s media in their reporting , particularly the news channel G@@ E@@ O .
The enlargement of the eurozone to include one of the new Member States is an extremely important and positive step in the European Union &quot; s economic and monetary integration .
Although it includes the call for all countries to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and underlines the need for greater efforts to combat climate change in the coming decades , we would have liked it to be stronger in other areas .
I was in Chad in March of this year three weeks after the rebel offensive .
Our choice was therefore limited , however regrettable .
When Greenland won significant home @-@ rule and decided to opt out of the EC , they had to negotiate their exit .
That is something which the Commission , particularly the internal market Commissioner , Mr Bolkestein , will be pleased to support .
However , the resolution refers to the demands adopted in the Bo@@ vé report and calls for measures to curb speculation and price volatility , as well as pointing out the key demand of the Hä@@ us@@ ling report for a crop protein plan to reduce dependence on protein crop imports ( mainly GM so@@ y ) and the specific needs of extensive grass@@ land beef production .
The current derogation ends on 31 December 2010 and the draft regulation extends the application of the derogation and proposes that the production / sales monopoly shall gradually decrease so that the monopoly will finally cease to exist as from 1 January 2018 .
That meant it went down the drain . That has resulted in blocked se@@ wers and other environmental problems as con@@ ge@@ aled fats and oils interfere with the infrastructure below our streets taking away the waste water .
According to the 2011 global climate risk index there are six Member States among the 35 countries in the world which are most at risk .
I believe that is where we will conclude on this important measure .
The MR@@ L regulation of 1990 came into force in 1992 , and there was a derogation for many countries until 1 January 2000 .
Therefore , I think that on these three items , the 2003 budget has been a success .
That is our challenge .
If people in fra@@ il boats are pushed back out to sea and never assessed for protection , none of those goals is achieved .
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading .
So , by doing , you learn something .
Does he not agree that would be a total misuse of public funds ?
in writing . - This future is di@@ m , especially now , on the eve of the Africa @-@ EU Summit .
However , is this really the answer to achieving the best communication possible between European citizens ?
I think Mr Farage was not far wrong when he said that it was due to the stupid@@ ity and greed of Irish politicians , who were part of the cron@@ y capitalism with the banks and regulators that brought a lot of this about .
recalls the pivotal role of the High Representative / Vice @-@ President in coordinating EU operations in third countries and regions ;
It is an issue of proportionality .
Secondly we must make sure that radioactive material should never be transported on ships carrying passengers .
This is destroying our inner cities , where drug dealers find a large market and sometimes even become role models for dis@@ enchan@@ ted young people .
It sadd@@ ens me as a proud Scottish European that the UK has represented Scotland so badly during the Presidency , and everything I have heard in this debate confirms my view that the UK has lost friends and influence on our behalf by this wron@@ gh@@ ea@@ ded stance on the budget .
If Brussels confined itself to cross @-@ border issues , then no one would have a problem .
One should not underestimate the importance of the situation , because some countries did feel an impact .
Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I wish to express our very strong support for this current programme of measures to combat unemployment in Europe &apos; s areas of industrial decline .
We still have to work hard to ensure the smooth integration of the new Member States .
Anything that impacts on the export of products from countries like my own would have a detrimental impact on the industry .
Commissioner , you said that quotas have out@@ lived their usefulness .
I would also like to pay tribute to Joseph Daul , whom I am replacing , for his hard work in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this Corbey report on fuel quality .
India , China and Brazil have caught the wave of opportunity and they are riding it high , while too much of Europe fears the wave cra@@ shing over it .
The Irish are the authors of their own mis@@ fortune : their government mis@@ managed their economy and fuelled a house @-@ building boom unrelated to reality .
In Amendment No 23 , the Commission supports the new paragraph 1 and paragraph 1 ( b ) , last sub@@ paragraph in full and paragraph 1 ( b ) , third and fourth sub@@ paragraphs , as well as paragraph 2 in principle .
While this falls short of the 100 % coverage which I know some colleagues would have preferred , I think it offers a realistic compromise given the technical and economic constraints that the industry is under .
Nor should the EU be in the business of signing military cooperation agreements with Russia and the CIS countries .
But I would like to remind you that most European Union humanitarian and development aid is not directed by the Commission but by the Member States .
Certainly from Israel &apos; s point of view - and I declare I am Vice @-@ President of the European Friends of Israel - the unpredictable situation in Egypt is diver@@ ting attention away from the peace process .
Finally , I would like to inform Parliament that the Commission intends to discuss with Member States a proposal for a large European consensus conference on n@@ euro @-@ degenerative diseases , including multiple sclerosis , to be held in 2009 or 2010 , and the Commission will be able ( on the basis of conclusions endorsed both by public and private stakeholders at that conference ) to propose a communication or other relevant policy initiative , including specific actions in all the fields of disease prevention , research and management of this group of diseases .
When there are 27 Member States represented in this Parliament , 27 Commissioners coming together from those Member States into the Commission , and Council Ministers going back to their Parliaments and coming here , it is very easy for the staff elected to serve us to actually take over the agenda .
As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ru@@ ination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union .
I would appeal through you , Mr President , to again ask our new Commissioner , An@@ toni@@ o Tajani , to sort this issue out and implement the regulation as quickly as possible .
Our concern is that the bees of Europe are doing essentially the same sort of service for us .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , I can only join in the concerns about the discovery of hundreds of graves in Jammu and Kashmir since 2006 , but I am particularly concerned about the armed attack on the respected human rights lawyer , Per@@ vez Im@@ ro@@ z , just 11 days ago in Sr@@ in@@ ag@@ ar , and the continuous harassment of numerous human rights activists .
Parliament particularly welcomes the inclusion of a new point in the proposed directive to prohibit all activities exposing workers to asbestos fibres , except dem@@ oli@@ tion work and disposal of waste products resulting from dem@@ oli@@ tion and removal work .
The role of citizens is particularly important with respect to our energy efficiency agenda .
You might as well equ@@ ate them with the city of Roma .
It is not good enough simply to have no impact - it must have a positive impact .
However , I believe that in a single market with a single currency , the distinction should disappear , but it may take some time .
Member of the Commission . - The Commission is of course concerned about the recent wholesale and retail price increases in food and food products .
Also , we should stress that the CEP@@ T , whilst it has made good progress in harmoni@@ zing the role of Member States to some degree , does not have all the answers .
I call on Parliament to support our amendments to reduce the initial step height to 24 c@@ m or to ensure a boarding aid .
Perhaps she could just tell us what her views are and whether she could convey the message to the Council on Friday .
That is why the question has been tabled in the terms it has .
I would like to repeat the call made by the presidency on 6 January asking for a public investigation into alleged electoral irregularities .
The Ecofin today came to a compromise .
The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 8 to 34 .
We , therefore , accept Amendments Nos 1 and 6 .
The report explicitly mentions the Internet and that account should be taken of future development of information and communication technologies .
You will notice that the date on this question is 30 March 2000 , which was two weeks before the last part @-@ session .
There really is not a difficulty with including the small further step which the rapporteur is asking for .
This Parliament passed an amendment to exempt baro@@ meter @-@ makers at first reading in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and in this Parliament .
For internal and external reasons I consider it absolutely necessary to reach an agreement on the sugar reform by November at the latest .
If Europe is not ambitious here , I am very much afraid that we will lose the growing markets of this century to our competitors .
The Commission will assist and monitor the Member States for the closure of the 2000 @-@ 2006 programmes and will make sure that the management and control systems under the new programming period will deliver their benefit .
It is crucial that a distinction should be made between commercial services and public services , and that public services such as water , sanitation and energy should not be dismantled or undermined in the GATS .
We showed it to the Belgian members and they did not like the look of that at all .
Rather , the agenda focused on how best to prioritise our existing resources and commitments , channelling our efforts into agreed national programmes that have been developed by the Afgh@@ an@@ is themselves .
The EU MDG Agenda should set a global example and we should be pushing for this example to be followed by the rest of the international community at the UN General Assembly in September .
I am appalled that the ECR Group , which contains the British Conservatives , has submitted an amendment to this proposal which reduces its coverage .
To conclude , just one sentence .
I am still not quite clear about your answer and would just like to ask whether you think that governments in neutral countries are being somewhat economical with the truth ?
If , as we say , we care about the poor and oppressed , if we believe in the right to life , then this House should support me in attempting to shine a light on this disgraceful situation .
We are all here aware of the importance of cooperation with the wider world , be it in liaison with the World Health Organization , UN agencies or third governments , particularly the United States .
I hope for a joint session of the European Parliament and the United States Congress , as I am sure that American parliamentarians are more subject to reason than the Bush Government .
Firstly , we can consider the 4@@ 35 % increase we have seen in the rates of children with au@@ tism in the last 15 years and the rates of AD@@ H@@ D , which currently affects 3 @-@ 5 % of children .
I wish us all a positive vote tomorrow , and I wish you all a better than expected New Year .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission welcomes the Got@@ tar@@ di report and the substance of the report fits well with that of the two earlier Commission reports on public finances in the EMU released in June 2007 and 2008 .
To conclude , we must believe in European manufacturing : it has potential for wealth and jobs .
As far as my own group is concerned , we have tabled a series of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage .
We need to support Al@@ sto@@ m .
I have not , but I have read various comments about it .
In areas where Muslim law is enforced men and women are not allowed to travel on the same public transport , and boys and girls have to be taught in separate schools .
We need to take account of different soil conditions across the European Union .
By and large , that has been a very good story in these reports and this is very clear from the reaction that we have from Parliament &apos; s own report .
Nevertheless , some of the unfinished business on international environmental governance will also need to be addressed , including matters such as UN@@ EP &apos; s funding , the reinforcement of its scientific basis and its role in enforcing international environmental agreements .
The only way of ensuring that we are properly able to police and quantify what is going on is to ensure that fins are landed attached to the shark &apos; s body .
At the same time campaigns are moving to re @-@ open long closed stations and lines to cope with demand and the need to reduce carbon emissions , such as the campaign in Rad@@ stock , Som@@ er@@ set .
Mr President , as I said when this regulation first came before this House , the concept of this proposal is in my view impractical , untenable and un@@ enforceable .
This is not an in@@ considerable issue .
in writing . - I wish to confirm my support for this report .
When it was first proposed that the extension of the programme was going to be aimed at direct taxation , there was a lot of concern , particularly in the UK , that this might lead to measures to introduce harmonisation of direct taxes .
We believe that light @-@ touch , principled @-@ based regulation is the best approach for the financial sector - it has proven its value .
Nevertheless , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has tabled this oral question to the Commission to ask it to play a more proactive role .
Many young people are also members of Cas@@ al J@@ aume I centres . The following day a press conference was held in the centre and the repor@@ ters could see the damage for themselves .

Today we express our deep concern at Peru &apos; s long @-@ standing failure to heed international protests against so @-@ called fac@@ eless courts , which remain totally unacceptable to the international community .
But two years ago I chaired our delegation for the elections of President Abbas , which were much welcomed by the international community .
Mr Chichester , as a fair and plain @-@ speaking English MEP , you got directly to the point when you asked what added value the directive has .
I am sorry , but you are speaking too fast for the interpreters .
The English text seems to have been transposed and now indicates that the Members have to pay more than the Parliament would contribute .
There are many questions about what actions to take now .
Recently I was at a nuclear power station where they have a battery the size of a building which provides the back @-@ up power in the event of a power cut .
Building capacity both in the public and private sectors , enhancing production and conform@@ ing with the WTO provisions should lead to increased investment in developing countries , in particular external investment and expanding economies .
But it really is important that we recognise that the whole world looks at these summits and looks at the moral leadership that we can offer , not only at EU level but also the US Administration .
in writing . - The Labour delegation will be voting in favour of the CAP and Global Food Security report , despite the strong reservations we have on the stance taken on the CAP .
( Hec@@ k@@ ling from the French non @-@ attached Members : &apos; Vous men@@ tez ! c &apos; est faux ! &apos; ) said that the Americans built the gas chambers in the Bu@@ ch@@ en@@ wal@@ d concentration camp after the War .
This has been important in facilitating private sector involvement in port service provision .
My Czech colleagues tell me that this has been very good for the qua@@ ils , but disastrous for the human beings who live and work there !
Will they run the same risk with cooked mea@@ ts ?
Citizens do not want less Europe .
A final decision concerning the number of MEPs to attend COP6 is expected by 31 October ; the Commission has proposed that the European Parliament be represented by eight Members .
On the contrary , what we want is just the possibility to facilitate the transposition of those decisions into European law .
B@@ ig@@ ger and bolder picture warnings are part of this awareness @-@ raising and , therefore , I cannot support Amendment 6 , which deletes paragraph 16 , which refers to these pictures .
European leaders , especially the British Government , can help to restore some balance in relations between Britain and the rest of Europe by agreeing on a framework for resolving the BSE problem at the summit .
As the Commissioner stated , the EU has ensured many improvements in animal welfare during transportation .
Indivi@@ du@@ ally and collectively , these three proposals will address major shortcomings brought to light by the dioxin crisis .
In this Parliament you have recently demonstrated the political importance of relations with India , both by setting up a new parliamentary delegation and also by inviting President Ab@@ du@@ l Kal@@ am to address the House last year , which was the first time an Indian Head of State had done so .
Personally , I consider that the time is now ripe for a substantive evaluation of transatlantic relations to give them the solid basis they deserve to withstand the current common challenges posed by the international environment - energy , climate change , emerging new powers , the financial and economic crisis , and terrorism .
In my opinion , this is the best option in the interests of both consumers and financial services providers .
We ought to focus on the basic points .
We have also been successful in presenting more focused , simpler and results @-@ oriented guidelines that concentrate on a limited number of major priorities and set out clearly the results we are aiming for .
This was found to constitute discrimination against EU carriers established in the territory of a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States , contrary to Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which guarantees nationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State .
We need to support the effort of the East Timorese to manage these oil activities better than what we have seen in many other developing countries .
Someone who once lived under the cloud of discrimination said : I have a dream .
For example , my country does not have as many small farms as in certain other European countries .
The hotlines have used a variety of methods to inform the public about how to contact them .
It is time to react !

Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission welcomes the report by Mr Schro@@ eder , which represents a balanced overview of the diversity of opinions surrounding the development impact of the Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) .
My question is that our current system for regulating the wild bird trade requires proof that it is harmful to wild populations before it can be suspended .
The European Union has taken a great stri@@ de towards political as well as economic integration today .
EU Heads of State have affir@@ med on a number of occasions that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people both collectively and individually must always be protected .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by thanking the Environment Committee and in particular , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Breyer , for her valuable report .
Why is it that it recommends these results should be improved on ?
President Khatami and his reformist allies are a symbol of that modernisation .
Ensuring a top @-@ class administration is a task that must be tackled in tandem with the EU institutions .
The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs said in a public interview in The Hague that Turkey will not ratify or implement the Ankara Protocol .
That was why we welcomed and supported the meeting held in July 2001 on this subject under the Belgian presidency of the Council .
One final word : I am sympathetic to what my friend , Mr Méndez de Vigo , has said , and will look closely at his suggestions , particularly as regards Amendment 15 , in order to try to meet the expectations expressed concerning a European strategy against poverty .
It used to be just ra@@ cing and sports , but now we have got a huge number of other areas , for example political pre@@ dictions .
The timescale set out in the report ( 2008 ) is thus completely unrealistic .
the status of religious organisations and
We still have to discuss the same measures to be taken , measures that should now be standard and routine in the European Union .
In fact , the raison d &apos; être of the directives is not in itself sufficient without the detailed procedural rules of the directives to guarantee uniform and legally certain application and to safeguard the rights of economic operators through efficient remedies .
Mr President , I would like to make a point of order based on Rules 166 and 16@@ 7 on the admissibility of part of a resolution .
On the southern neighbourhood : at its extraordinary meeting on 11 March , the European Council declared that democratic u@@ pris@@ ings are bringing dramatic changes to the southern neighbourhood , creating new hope and an opportunity to build a future based on democracy , pluralism , the rule of law , human rights and social justice .
It was clearer for me on the first vote than it was on the subsequent ones .
No more talk ; no more app@@ ea@@ sement .
Those ships are dry cargo ships , they are not war vessels .
I thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation and hard work .
In particular , my thanks go to the rapporteur , Mrs Ayuso , for her analysis of the proposal and efforts to understand its objectives .
At various meetings at both political and official level the EU has expressed its full support and its satisfaction with the steps taken by both countries .
There has been no solidarity among European Union countries and that is disgraceful .
Unfortunately , there are suicide bombers coming over the borders , a lot of funds are being smugg@@ led , so you always have the two sides of this conflict , but we think that it is important to have prolonged this mission at the Rafah crossing because only with the European Union is there a chance of there being an opening .
Most kin@@ ship carers are grand@@ parents and find themselves being the main ca@@ regi@@ vers for their grandchildren , normally because the parent either has a drug addiction or has died through that drug addiction .
It is remarkable and alarming that the future of work and the future of society are decided by the half of the population which does not take equal responsibility for raising the children and maintaining the household .
Mr President , I have an oral amendment to paragraph 38 , which will also replace Amendment 1 : &apos; Consid@@ ers that Member States have long and diverse traditions in consumer protection ; notes that the &#91; one word deleted &#93; call from part of the financial services industry is for minimum harmonisation , whereas certain practitioners , notably the banking industry , advocate targeted harmonisation in order to achieve a true level playing field ; therefore , urges the Commission to organise a discussion about the fundamental structure of the EU financial services market , bearing in mind consumer and practi@@ tioner interests and European global competitiveness ; &quot; .
We need to do something here .
We can bring the benefits of free trade to many of the citizens of poorer countries while recognising some of the transitional problems they will have to face in adjusting to increased competition .
One relates to the philosophy and markets .
We have relaun@@ ched &apos; Debate Europe &apos; to include the new Reform Treaty .
Governments , public institutions and the Commission should lead the way by example .
We would all welcome the setting of standards of quality for blood products .
Whilst Amendment 4 poses some difficulty , I recognise the important work of the report and I recognise the importance of producing trac@@ eable , high quality and safe products .
The question is : how can we make sure that these additional public financial flows will be predictable , be spent transparently and effectively , and that the contributions to those flows will be shared internationally ?
This was a worthwhile initiative that we welcome , value and appreciate .
Are we serious ?
Sav@@ ers deserve transparent information , which is easy to understand and available .
We should now use that stage as a spr@@ ing@@ board .
So I end as I began by saying that we do not lack ambition , we need the resources to do the job properly , we need to be able to be consistent , we need to develop and strengthen what we do , and that is what we will do , but we will do it by taking the 27 Members of the European Union on that journey with us , leading sometimes , pushing sometimes , working alongside sometimes , and your support will be invaluable to that .
In the words of the UK Health and Safety Executive , the body set up to give the UK Government the expert and impartial scientific advice so necessary when dealing with such issues , these amendments provide &quot; no benefit for health and safety and their sole effect will be to place unnecessary and unwelcome burdens on industry , particularly on small firms &quot; .
The European Union is a profoundly value @-@ based entity that makes respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms a key policy priority in its external actions .
I agree with those speakers who stressed the importance of this particular directive .
in writing . - I would ask fellow MEPs to imagine for a moment that they are in business .
Health in developing countries is , together with education , one of the six priorities for the Commission for 2002 .
This can take time .
99 % voted for independence .
But , as for the allocation of the rest of the 300 million , that will be in the final analysis for the budgetary authority to decide at the end of second reading .
This would not be healthy for the European Union now and into the future . It certainly would not be healthy in the context of the impending enlargement of the European Union itself .
We need you to design a comprehensive and decisive strategy .
I am delighted that the one Member State &apos; s objection has been lifted to the adoption of the framework decision .
We tried to see what could be done on the ground in order to make the situation move forward , not to have only negative experiences .
The other day we also discussed it with Richard Hol@@ bro@@ oke , the Special Envoy for both Afghanistan and Pakistan .
That , I think , is a factor of very great importance in trying to achieve this focus and this synthesis of ideas .
Can I ask this question to the Commissioner : are you going to receive any information from an inquiry that is supposed to be carried out by the police both sides of the border ?
By defining the &quot; public concerned &quot; , we are focusing the attention of the competent authorities on the need to take account of those citizens most directly affected .
This means that the Energy Community could bring much more stability - at least to prices - and could even reduce prices for consumers .
Other spirits like vodka are distil@@ led at a high strength and may then even be fil@@ tered through char@@ coal to remove the taste of the raw materials .
Let your forum take over this issue and go further with it .
On the same issue , it is not just in getting the honourable Member &apos; s name wrong that the administration have bo@@ ob@@ ed , in actual fact the question of restraint of trade is a question for Mr Monti because he is the one who has put the paper before the Commission and he is down for questions , so I do not see why it was tabled in the wrong section .
That is why I made the point that Europe is actually providing funding that does not increase the debt of our partner countries .
Please rest assured that you will receive detailed information on your observations when we send you the annual action programmes in the framework of your droit de regard under comitology .
I can also tell Parliament that negotiations with Syria are scheduled to start on 14 May .
They have come up with only a unilateral solution and a narrow list .
In general terms , I welcome the thrust of Mrs Fraga &apos; s paper which should help to encourage market stability .
How do we explain to all those who are losing their jobs that we , the MEPs , need more staff because of the Lisbon Treaty ?
In the second week of March , we are planning to have a comprehensive text , including a recommendation , which will be open to discussion and amendments and which will wind up with a debate in plenary with the participation of the High Representative , who , to our knowledge , is not available this week .
As regards other contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund , it may be worth noting that the draft budget by the US administration suggests a US contribution of USD 600 million which follows on from pledges made earlier and which corresponds to the share of HIPC calculated by the World Bank for the US .
However , that committee does not share the views of the Commission on the need and the means to reduce those distortions of competition .
This is just by way of a comment on the suspicion that the Commission is not equally strict with all the Member States , but I think it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to comment on this matter .
In particular we need a stronger buy @-@ in of sectors other than nature conservation , such as agriculture , fisheries and energy .
That is what we need in Durban .
What will our exit strategy from trade sanctions be ?
Will you , Mr Barroso , speak to the rest of the Commission and only introduce EID on a voluntary basis until the equipment used is 100 % accurate ?
Those amendments recognised the reality that in the conditions of the 21st century European agriculture will be much less labour @-@ intensive and more mechanis@@ ed in almost all sectors .
I believe that we have now reached a sensible conclusion and would hope that the amendments adopted in committee , which address those concerns , can be supported in the plenary vote .
As I explained to you only three weeks ago , the fisheries sector is facing a crisis which is structural and long lasting .
It is appropriate to allow Member States to intervene if and when it is appropriate to do so .
In 2015 , and no doubt in 2030 too , we will be back regret@@ ting lack of progress , extending deadlines , reducing targets , setting up working parties and failing to help the hungry nations to solve their needs .
I am extremely grateful to the House for the opportunity to comment on these extremely important matters .
My first point is about the terminology we are using today .
I was very much impressed by the explicit expression of appreciation and support for the work of the Customs Union ; I can assure you that it will continue .
The College had an extensive discussion yesterday on the Asian crisis and on how we should organise our follow @-@ up to the work done so far .
Together , I am confident we can meet the complex challenges of today and tomorrow and work in partnership to ensure the internal market delivers its full potential to all our citizens .
It is valuable work , which we must keep up in the coming months .
It will create an atmosphere , a situation in which it can work carefully , thoroughly and I hope successfully to make positive use of this very brave new technology that we should all welcome , with the appropriate safeguards .
Where would Europe &apos; s tourism industry be without the rich@@ ness of our culture ?
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .
Mr President , this is not a point of order , I just wanted to thank our colleagues who signed Written Declaration No 21 .
They should also stop exploiting them .
These derogations are called the 8 ( 4 ) derogations .
The very adjec@@ tive &apos; atypical &apos; in the name of this directive says it all .
The governments responsible should ensure that treatment is provided to bring some alleviation of the awful hurt and sorrow they bear .
In an environment of political , social and economic insecurity , issues of human rights are sadly taking back@@ stage , and the most recent detention of political activists is a case in point .
For instance , the FAO Code of Conduct provides that states should take measures to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity and should ensure that levels of fishing effort are in line with sustainable use of fisheries resources .
I support the call on the Commission to come forward with a green paper .
As I said earlier , some others have announced their intentions through press statements .
This is what we needed and this is what we have got .
In West L@@ oth@@ ian a project has been developed on street work with a partnership from Munich .
I have a couple of questions for the Commissioner .
Speaking purely personally , and off the top of my head , may I invite the Italian presidency to look at what happened in the early 1990s , before enlargement to Sweden , Finland and Austria ?
Can I first of all thank and congratulate Mrs Pack for leading us through this process , and also the Commission for standing by in what was a hard @-@ fought , long and , in Parliament &apos; s view , a responsible negotiation , following which we are very happy to vote for the programme .
We can only take general measures to push a government into caring for its population .
. I want to express my thanks to the Member who tabled this question , because it is a very relevant issue .
One of the distinctive advantages of the euro is that it will enable consumers in my country and elsewhere to compare the prices of goods and services , including tourism products .
As far as the environmental aspect of this report is concerned , this is something which concerns me very much as a representative of London , one of the major cities in the EU , obviously conten@@ ding with car pollution all the time and always looking for ways of dealing with it .
We must as a Parliament express our clear view that in a matter of years we simply will not allow them in .
The joint statement recognised the special autonomy law as the starting @-@ point for further negotiations in an all @-@ inclusive dialogue and confirmed the intention of both parties to work on an agreement for the cessation of hostilities .
That constitutional transition should be founded on substantive and consistent commitments which are properly followed through .
Mr President , although today was a good day for animal welfare in terms of seals , it was a less good day in terms of the way we have just voted on animal testing .
Apparently - though I saw him saying these things on television - he said that Turkey has no reason to make any concessions to the EU over Cyprus and that it is easy for Turkey to resolve this matter by sacrifi@@ cing 135 000 - he has even counted the number - of its soldiers in order to occupy both Cyprus and Greece .
I would ask the Commissioner to take that opportunity and run with it .
I shall convey to my colleague Mr Barrot all that they have said today .
If it can work with the democratic underpinning of this Parliament , the Council &apos; s connection with national administrations and the Commission &apos; s expertise and European vision , that service can truly become a powerful tool for the European Union to achieve its goals on the global stage .
However , babies do not know , nor are they able to consider what their mothers must , or want to , do .
I think there has to be a fair opportunity for Members to intervene in debate .
I believe that , in order to also have an emotional attachment to Europe , we need a social dimension .
Ten days of limited , focused , proportionate bomb@@ ard@@ ment stopped the aggression then .
Member States are responsible for determining the social requirements - such as death in service benefits - for their own pension funds and the tax reli@@ efs that they give , consistent with subsidiarity .
I urge the June Council to sort out this issue once and for all , and to make it quite clear that workers , not politicians , should choose their working time .
At the same time , not only through the funds but also in general , we have embarked on a process that would allow us to contribute to the European structure in such a way as to ensure that future structures , based on new factors of production and growth , would be more flexible .
Mr President , today we are discussing the last reports by this House on Bulgaria and Romania .
P@@ ush@@ ing for clear labelling is the only way to convince our customers that food safety is top of our list .
This is not the context to raise the civil liberties concerns , but there is an important economic dimension .
I hope the Commission notes that .
We now have a scheme that other countries can join and use to help drive down their emissions - if they limit the pre @-@ auction elements and set ambitious targets .
I think we should be cautious , before altering the definition of crimes against humanity included in the ICC Statute .
Most Member States , as you are aware , have specific procedural rules for competition @-@ related issues and these include , for example , referring these cases directly to higher courts , limiting the number or type of competent courts or using specialist courts .
Also , the importance of creation and innovation has to be viewed within the services framework .
They also discriminate against people and organisations who believe the Ho@@ ly S@@ crip@@ tures to be the W@@ ord of God , the only inf@@ alli@@ ble Rule of Fa@@ ith and Practi@@ ce , forcing such believers to employ those who propag@@ ate and practise acts of sex totally against the scrip@@ tural ethics .
On the contrary , the Commission proposal must be seen in the broader context of growing parliamentary oversight functions , in particular , with a view to existing and future Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) and EDF programmes .
That is why the Greens are supporting very strongly this resolution from the Environment Committee .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , Mr Potočnik , the Commissioner responsible for this file , is here with me , but unfortunately he has to remain silent because of a problem with his thro@@ at .
If we look at the history we see very rapid action following the oil shock in 1973 .
We must say to him that on the verge of the next millennium he cannot use events which took place in 13@@ 89 to justify mass murder today .
Do we take it for granted that we have overcome this problem , that there is no need for action or that it is a problem for others , for certain risk groups ?
Therefore , the final responsibility lies with Member States .
I welcome the opportunities we have for deep engagement with India and for India &quot; s wider regional role .
I am confident that the outcome of this process will ensure that standards respond to European needs and are easily acceptable and applicable by all stakeholders in the EU and also globally .
That is why the Commission has proposed a number of amendments concerning such matters as access to employment by asylum applicants , enhanced material reception conditions , better addressing of the needs of vulnerable persons and recourse to detention .
Our citizens must be reassured that cancer can be defeated and we , in the European Parliament , are determined to continue to support this fight until , and unless , this is accomplished .
Mr President , having been rapporteur on the Lisbon Treaty , I should like to support this proposal .
Can we deliver ?
I met one woman who will be a presidential candidate and who is determined to show that women have that role to play in Egypt .
I shall now comment on a few things that have come up in the discussion , and I think it is worthwhile taking them up .
But the background to this particular proposal has to be kept in mind and , since I appreciate your position , I would ask you to appreciate mine .
That right of public access to the documents of the institution is related to the democratic nature of those institutions . &apos;
The Member States may designate - as the rapporteur said - mixing zones , where concentrations of chemical substances may exceed the relevant environmental quality standards under certain circumstances , but of course they will have to reach and be monitored with great care .
Nevertheless , this is a step forward in terms of information and consultation rights for workers , and I welcome it .
. I and my British Conservative colleagues have voted against the Parliament &quot; s reports on the budgetary discharge because , for the eleventh year running , the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance of the overall EU accounts .
Things have changed over the last few decades , and those areas that were less @-@ favoured areas 20 or 25 years ago may no longer be fulfilling the same criteria .
It gives a clear signal to Saddam Hussein that Europe is united in its condemnation of Iraq &apos; s failure to comply with UN Security Council resolutions .
Information about quality and standards of care in other Member States is another important factor for those of us who may need to travel abroad for treatment .
Can anyone argue with any persu@@ asi@@ veness that women are treated equally and fairly , that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion , belief , gender , disability , age , sexual orientation , opinion , political affiliation etc ?
For us , it is important to draw the right line between what is right and what is abuse and to proceed in such a way as to show , and to prove , that for us the right ends where and when the abuse starts .
New people have appeared as leaders .
We should also note the growing numbers of attacks on religious minorities in Europe itself and equally condemn that .
Having read their report and listened to the debate here this morning , I ask myself : is the glass half empty , or is the glass half full ?
A slightly smaller reduction was applied to Afghanistan , which still allows the Community to meet its multiannual pledge for reconstruction assistance .
I hope that our Prime Minister will be straight with the British people on the issues that arise at Lisbon .
I should issue a word of caution to those of you who have a strong desire for , or who expect , the elimination of live animal transport .
The EU must not remain passive .
. I have voted for the Schmid report because I believe it supports and makes a contribution to the achievement of the three main goals of the &apos; European Employment Strategy &apos; , namely full employment , increased productivity and greater social inclusion within society of marginalised and disadvantaged groups .
Indeed , judging by Mr Casaca &apos; s tone , he is positively affron@@ ted to find that the law of a Member State should ever prevail over the Commission : heaven for@@ bid !
It states that only four per cent of overseas development aid is dedicated to agriculture .
This funding could then be doubled through co @-@ financing instruments up to € 50@@ m .
I am genuinely grateful for the insi@@ ghts that have been gar@@ ne@@ red in our debate that reflect the experience and expertise of Members of this House .
If you know these companies that have such a beautiful life ...
The extension to six months of the minimum period of outstanding pay claims to be guaranteed would also significantly increase public expenditure and go well beyond the social aims of the Directive .
The first edition of the consumer market scoreboard took place at the beginning of this year .
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on safety of toys by Andreas Schwab , An@@ ja Weisgerber , Mari@@ an@@ ne Thyssen , Anna Maria C@@ ora@@ z@@ za Bildt , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , Ev@@ el@@ y@@ ne Gebhardt , Chris@@ tel Schaldemose , Anna Hedh , Barbara Weiler , on behalf of the Group of the Pro@@ gressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , Cris@@ tian Silvi@@ u Bu@@ şoi , J@@ ür@@ gen Cre@@ ut@@ z@@ mann , Ant@@ ony@@ ia Par@@ van@@ o@@ va , N@@ ad@@ ja H@@ ir@@ sch , on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , Hei@@ de Rühle , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Malcolm Harbour , on behalf of the European Conservatives and Re@@ formis@@ ts - B7 @-@ 06@@ 58 / 2010 ) .
We do not think that having a capital adequacy regime for funds sol@@ ves the problem .
I know that is against the Jac@@ ob@@ inist language policy that is practised in some European states , but the EU will work to promote diversity , democracy and freedom and to maintain real equality between languages in the European Union .
First of all , I agree that women should be given and should take every opportunity to establish gender parity .
I am glad we have resisted that so far and we must resist it in the future .
In the light of the information collected by the Commission in cooperation with national authorities , the E@@ merg@@ ency Committee of the General Products Safety Directive reached on 16 May 2000 the conclusion that no specific danger relating to the associated product has been identified .
So , if there is a problem with regard to the Socialist Group , it is not our concern .
I have always believed that EU legislation in this area should be broadened to include offences other than drug offences .
We act because of who we are , and who we are is shaped by our actions .
That is why the Commission is considering raising this matter with the Member States and it is also exploring the possibility of financing the Court and its outreach activities through other financial instruments .
in writing . - We seriously regret that MEPs have un@@ question@@ ingly approved this problematic trade agreement .
It is perpetrated by criminals and murderers who det@@ est our liberal democracy and freedom .
This marks a significant step towards achieving freedom of association and allowing civil society a role in the development of the country .
To feed and look after three million people over the winter will be difficult .
I did not support amendments which failed to recognise the positive developments in relation to care for older people .
The Commission does not , and never has , side @-@ stepped its responsibilities in this field .
( The President cut the speaker off )
For how could Parliament &apos; s Committee on Budgets discharge the budget without exercising its function to scrutinise the financial management and allocation of funds ?
I therefore welcome the Commission &apos; s EU 2020 initiative , now endorsed by the European Council , and I congratulate particularly Mr Barroso for his part in this .
It must be led and it must be managed in a proper fashion but , above all else , it must set down a clear and deliver@@ able strategy to make Haiti the proud , independent and democratic entity that it should be , but which it is not and has not been up to now , thus leading to the present catastrophe .
Thank you for the reply , Commissioner , which sounds encouraging .
It can destroy the whole financing of smaller enterprises .
rapporteur . - Madam President , before you proceed to vote on Amendments 49 and 67 , could I ask that you reverse the order of the vote and vote first on 67 , which is a later compromise that emerged after the vote in the committee ?
Mr President , concerning item No 10 on page 16 of the Minutes , Mr Novo raised the matter of the use of the bridge over rue Bel@@ li@@ ard to film a demonstration . The President said that he would reply in writing .
Under certain conditions , it is also possible to increase the aid intensi@@ ties for regions already designated under the original regional aid map .
Last week &quot; s European Council referred the issue to the first General Affairs and External Relations Council under the Irish presidency .
So , too , can fisheries @-@ dependent communities , particularly when they are to be found in areas of the kind just mentioned .
We remain un@@ persuaded and we will vote against most of them .
If Mr Blokland says that is not very logical then I am afraid I cannot follow the logic of Mr Blokland .
My distinguished colleague , Professor Ti@@ m Con@@ g@@ don , has written a pa@@ mph@@ let on this .
That would be completely impossible without the European Union .
In other words our fishing communities could be much more prosperous than they are today if we can succeed in putting together an acceptable package providing effective management of the resource and maxim@@ i@@ zing yield .
Honourable Members , I developed and recently adopted a strategy to cover the whole period of my mandate .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , may I first say that I have sympathy with the workers in An@@ tw@@ er@@ p , but I would like to point out another couple of issues regarding the EU and General Motors .
Commissioner ...
I should like to finish .
RAPEX @-@ China gives the Chinese authorities access to details of risks found in Chinese products sold in Europe , and this is a very valuable source of information for them .
The Commission has been seeking more sufficient delegated powers for transposing future amendments to the scheme .
This was the reality before the current block exemption was adopted in 2002 , and it remains the reality eight years later , but then , as now , single bran@@ ding was the most common distribution model .
While many other countries still have fiscal space , they should not start consolidation before next year - this is to ensure that we do not suffo@@ cate the current ongoing economic recovery .
Quite often , if you are taken on as a live @-@ in employee , you can be seen as being on call 24 / 7 .
This morning I spoke with Mr Berenguer , the shadow rapporteur , who I believe can now confirm that he is content with what I am suggesting , i.e. that we should vote against the second half of Amendment No 3 and against Amendment No 6 .
Net@@ working can be useful in dissemin@@ ating ideas for best practice , but we must not delu@@ de ourselves that a Year of Lifelong Learning will make a real difference .
These people experience the worst elements of the Irish penal system and this is unacceptable in view of their legal status as innocent citizens .
However , in deciding what is unfair trade we must also take into account a wider Community interest than the present rules allow and we must avoid damage to European countries that set up global supply chains .
For example , I very strongly reject the notion that some of these agencies just do PR and work of a very superfi@@ cial nature .
I welcome the recent developments in Scotland , where changes in fishermen &apos; s safety training mean that an age exemption for older cat@@ chers will be a thing of the past and that basic sea survival , first aid and survival training will soon be mandatory for all fishermen .
Mr President , as chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , it gives me great pleasure first of all to say how much we all appreciate the fact that Commissioner Barnier and Commissioner Dalli are both here today , as a number of my colleagues have observed , and secondly also to remark that I think this is a remarkable occasion for Parliament .
The lack of information and consultation by this company is quite a disgrace , showing more clearly the importance of proper information and consultation legislation prior to such a decision being announced .
Since the information contained in the annual report is of a self @-@ explanatory nature , it might be more useful if I concentrate my remarks here and now on some of the issues addressed by the draft resolution prepared by your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . After that I shall be happy to answer any questions you might have .
If you do something about that , then you will be helping the rest of the world .
&apos; Reli@@ gious belief &apos; is guaranteed , but what about practice ?
This is a barbaric and hypocritical position .
Voluntary organisations at the grassroots level must be enabled to take part in our funding programmes .
On this occasion we formally launched the high @-@ level economic dialogue between India and the EU .
One thing I would highlight from the position of the Environment Committee is the need for the European Union to sort itself out when it comes to addressing the issue of genetically modified production in the countries of the third world .
Mr President , I wish to begin by compli@@ menting Mrs Cresson on containing her laugh@@ ter when she was reading the scrip@@ t .
What are the conditions under which services are provided ?
The report asks that workers representatives be allowed to scrutinise the information provided , that information be provided in good time before consultation , and that trade unions be involved in the process in order to consolidate social dialogue .
That report will address all aspects of these questions .
The Lisbon Summit last week set out ambitious targets to turn Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge @-@ based economy in the world .
President @-@ in @-@ Office , you take on the presidency of the European Council at a time when the Union faces its greatest @-@ ever challenge : the largest expansion of our Community in the history of European integration .
There is no threat to human health .
We know that wage @-@ ear@@ ners and workers are having losses connected to putting money into hedge @-@ fund specu@@ lating in this deriv@@ ative market .
What do we need in order to achieve this ?
I hope it will come up with fresh proposals where necessary , but in an open and transparent way .
By the way , it was very interesting to hear earlier from the Ear@@ l of Dartmouth , speaking as he was as an aris@@ to@@ cra@@ t , about competition policy .
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .
We are confident that we can deliver the impact assessment within the time foreseen by Parliament .
However , I think that the European Parliament has lost touch with reality .
So we need our own approval system to be in place and I think that progress is being made to cla@@ w back the applications that are not yet approved , speeding up the procedure in EFSA without losing the quality .
On the other hand , we have to be careful not to push Nigeria into the hands of religious extremists , including Muslim extremists .
Is it the case that the Council still attaches importance to the democratic inter@@ play between the three institutions and that closer cooperation will not inevitably mean greater decision making by one institution , by the Council , to the detriment of Parliament and Commission and , by implication , the people of Europe ?
I just wanted to say that listening to Mr Tomczak proves exactly why we need a debate on homophobia in this House .
This may be due to a number of factors .
My unease is heightened by the recognition that a driving motivation in this report is to bolster EU integration and the European security and defence policy , rather than prioritising tangible economic benefit .
Madam President , there has not been sufficient consistency in the EU dialogues with third countries and such a situation may undermine the very credibility of the EU &apos; s human rights policy .
This would be an incorrect step because of the different criminal legal systems operating in Europe .
We welcome the French Presidency &apos; s initiative aimed at improving cooperation between national authorities responsible for tackling money laundering and laying down uniform penalties .
Overall , this situation has undoubtedly led to disruption in the trade of these Member States with Russia , and it is not made easier by the fact that Russia is not a member of the WTO and does not therefore consider itself bound by the rules of the WTO .
This would benefit not only the banking industry but the whole EU economy .
However , in order for Venezuela to be a full member , that Treaty has to be ratified by the parliaments .
My area has 90 islands , and one can imagine some of the stress involved in getting the animals from the islands to the mainland , and th@@ ence on further long journeys .
Both sides have made compromises .
In 2005 @-@ 2006 the Commission has been funding an ILO pilot project aiming to develop decent work indicators in developing countries for examining the relationship between decent work and trade liberalisation .
Millions of healthy animals were needlessly slaughtered in an or@@ gy of killing and burning that shocked the world .
It would be an important political signal of continuing EU commitment to Afghanistan .
As you know , there is already a reduction @-@ suspension mechanism in Regulation 12@@ 90 / 2005 .
It would be geographically un@@ natural ; it would economically harmful ; it would be politically disastrous .
Indeed , it will have entirely the opposite effect .
As mentioned in the EP resolution , efforts should include support to producer efforts in diversification , organisational strengthening and ta@@ pping into niche markets .
To them , however , those 15 years will seem more than half as long again as the decade that Spain waited to come into our Union .
Is there any new evidence in the documentation provided by AF@@ S@@ SA ?
We have one issue to settle : should we have a minimum unit for each exempted Euro@@ bond of EUR 50 000 or of EUR 100 000 ?
EUR 6 billion has been provided for wind farm developments across the EU , according to Mr May@@ stadt , but the EIB simply accepts the applications for funding from the governments concerned without scrutiny .
Mob@@ ile c@@ ran@@ es and truck ji@@ bs are used for public han@@ g@@ ings and , as there is no drop , this subjects the person being executed to a slow , painful death by as@@ phy@@ xi@@ ation .
The separation of SMEs &apos; registered offices and headquarters is already general practice in half of the Member States , including those with very high standards of social policy safeguards .
I was the but@@ t of - as Mrs Pol@@ lack has said - some of the most fer@@ oci@@ ous lobbying ever seen in this Parliament .
There are three key elements that I see .
The discussions in the WTO leading up to the decision of 30 August were long and complex .
Thus , in Mr Coelho &apos; s otherwise admirable report , we have paragraph 2 , which in a somewhat brus@@ que tone calls on those two states to abolish their border controls .
Im@@ porters , not just manufacturers , will be responsible for ensuring the toys they bring into Europe meet our tough new standards .
Mr President , I was not intending to take the floor now under the catch @-@ the @-@ eye procedure , but was denied the right to raise the blue card .
This is why it is essential that Europol works in conjunction with third party states since only then will its full effectiveness be realised .
In this regard , it is highly regrettable that , at the very moment that he took over the Presidency , Mr Zapatero watered down considerably his earlier commitment to a fair accession process .
We will not prove the added value of the European Parliament to citizens by fighting for rights alone .
in writing . - The Europe 2020 Strategy should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger , through jobs and smart , sustainable and inclusive growth based on five EU headline targets as regards promoting employment .
However welcome and important the Commission &apos; s proposals are , they are clearly insufficient .
Thirdly , the Commission agrees with the preoccupation of the rapporteur as far as the famous RA@@ L , reste à liqui@@ der , the backlog , is concerned .
It is also extremely hypocritical in that it critic@@ ises the Echelon interception system , while at the same time we are planning to establish a European secret service .
Second , you will undoubtedly share the view that the complexity of the rules dis@@ coura@@ ges potential beneficiaries from applying for EU financial support .
There will be an amendment from the PPE @-@ DE and PSE Groups to Paragrap@@ hs 6 and 7 , to remove the figures , to delete Paragraph 7 , and to put in a statement which will mention our rights again , because this is what this debate is all about .
in writing . - I voted for this first reading report on Commission plans to protect soil .
I should like to inform Parliament that I have asked for the oral question and debates on the future of the Western Balkans , originally planned to coincide with the vote on the European Agency for Reconstruction &apos; s report , to be postponed until the December part @-@ session .
All the aspects that I have referred to are , I believe , a deterrent to small companies .
. Just today , we have approved a recommendation to the Council with draft negotiating directives for a new agreement with Russia .
One benefit of this system is that it enables the Commission to take action systematically against Member States which have not adopted national measures to implement directives before the time allowed for trans@@ pos@@ al is completed .
Recent figures show that the population could increase by up to 10 % over the next 10 @-@ 15 years .
Let me conclude by expressing my special thanks to the European Parliament for its continuous support , over the years , of the Commission &apos; s efforts to achieve better financial management of the European Union &apos; s budget .
Let us send a positive signal to the rest of the world that Europe is open for business and that , in the teeth of this recession , we are keen to keep our markets as open as possible .
But it kept being said Cuba had not been given any humanitarian aid until now .
As@@ k the people .
It is only since we joined the European Union that Ireland has become truly independent .
The European Union , through the experience of its Member States and experts and by virtue of this proposal , which has been greatly improved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , is rising to the challenge of assisting Member States in public health .
I look forward to listening to the views of Members in today &apos; s debate .
Both of these possess nuclear weapons and one of them at least has not dis@@ av@@ owed first use of those weapons .
This can largely be overcome by an EU @-@ wide standard training course including animal welfare and the ethics of experiments .
I look forward , however , to the day when France , and other EU nations , have direct control of their own fishing interests .
I can assure you that the Commission will make public all the relevant elements .
Finally , in response to the comment by Mr Clark , who suggests we should have &apos; trade not aid &apos; , I would say that in the EU we manage both - trade via the single market and targeted aid where needed .
I want a guarantee that when I go into my local health food shop the ech@@ in@@ ac@@ ea or g@@ insen@@ g I buy is of a high quality and standard .
The Commission and Parliament have challenged this before the Court of Justice , as they have done in other similar cases .
The F@@ ESCO agreement represents a first informal attempt to establish a collective European view on this concept and it should be welcomed as a valuable first step towards clarifying this important operational concept .
Finally , it is the right and duty of every citizen , elected or not , to use all peaceful avenues to try to uphold international law .
The report has many references to non @-@ trade clauses which I am pleased to say are consistent with the line that I took in my own report on Korea , and in particular I am pleased that the report emphasises strong social and environmental clauses .
I wonder , Commissioner , whether you have ever considered the possibility of reversing the burden of proof .
Mr President , there are two key reasons for action in this field .
In a globalised marketplace , the only way to stay competitive is to stay loose , ready to fill the gap , ready to exploit an opening , ready for anything .
As Mr MacCormick said - and I welcome him back to Strasbourg after our two meetings in Edinburgh - we all agree .
That is quite true . Nevertheless it is one of the few specific things where Europe as a whole can do something more .
We need to cut carbon emissions quickly and as cheaply as possible .
Mr President , I agree with many of the comments that have been made so far by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Maij @-@ Weggen on the situation in Burma .
Just like the cu@@ be , it should bear the symbols , it should have a message and be a ke@@ y@@ stone and a foundation for our joint European building , but , at the same time , it is made up of 27 pieces .
Both of our institutions are following closely developments in China .
Parliament should be discussing those proposals when we next meet in Strasbourg in December , not next June .
I find them un@@ seem@@ ly , ill @-@ advised , un@@ timely and inappropriate because these are amendments which use three words - &quot; genocide &quot; , &quot; Muslim &quot; and &quot; Asian &quot; - in a way that is racist , derog@@ atory and discriminatory and which causes im@@ penet@@ rable and false barriers to be erec@@ ted against Turkey &apos; s accession to the Union .
I am looking forward to a fruitful discussion with you .
In addition , the pace at which this directive has been adopted enables the timetable to stay on track , meaning action will not be delayed .
This agency would complement at European level the regulatory tasks performed by the N@@ RAs and do so by providing a framework for them to cooperate with each other by regulatory oversight of the cooperation between transmission system operators by giving the Agency individual decision powers and by giving it a general advisory role .
This was always going to be difficult to achieve but the Greek Government approached this political issue at all times with determination and with true sensitivity to all the parties involved .
I also have to say that in these negotiations we never targeted the market of the developing countries .
The tank was full and was paid for by the company .
I will come back to this .
The current energy negotiations with Russia have to be based on reciprocity , the rule of law and transparency .
However , we are entirely opposed to the proposal as it has now emerged from the committee .
Many of the compromises that have been negotiated I am happy now to support .
The Commission would equally welcome strong support from this House for a directive that gives all citizens a right to the same approach and level of ambition for flood risk protection , prevention and preparedness , regardless of where they live in the Community : in trans@@ boundary or national river bas@@ ins , or in the coastal areas of the Community .
For this reason I believe that , with the very good spirit coming from the Member States , we could look optimis@@ tically towards this target .
The Commission must continue to support our view that without aid and trade preferences to provide the social safety nets there will be never any possibility of delivering equitable growth to the poorest countries .
We must accept that responsibility .
They share a small cell with three other prisoners .
I am therefore confident that the proposal can be adopted soon and that the timely application of the EM@@ CS is ensured .
You mentioned pension scheme reforms , and I am pleased to hear that , because people who give up work , very often to care for children or older persons , do not pay adequate social security contributions , and it is often carers who do not have adequate pensions .
The EU will keep up the pressure to ensure that they are .
Therefore , I was determined from the outset to give the report a very tight structure so that people interested in different human rights issues and themes in different countries , could navig@@ ate it quickly and efficiently , as opposed to having a lengthy report with no headings , requiring people to read a third , half or indeed the whole report to find the area in which they were interested .
The Commission allows millions to be lost but has no consideration for those in the most desperate circumstances .
We need to get it right now , because we are not only negotiating with the US , Canada and Australia , but also setting a model and example for agreements with other countries .
The stock of AI@@ G has plun@@ ged more than 90 % , from USD 72 last year to USD 2.@@ 05 .
in writing . - This provides for visa @-@ free travel between the Seychelles and Member States of the EU .
We must preserve the six@@ - and t@@ wel@@ ve@@ - mile zones at least .
I greatly appreciate the opportunity this occasion has allowed me to ensure that the presidency is made aware of issues and concerns .
The proposal is structured around three main areas .
A general agreement has been reached in the Council on a proposal for a Council directive on the residence permits issued to third @-@ country nationals who have been victims of trafficking and who cooperate with the competent authorities .
What this means is that China will issue an export licence for all exports and , in parallel , the EU licensing offices in the Member States will issue an import licence .
In a way it has been a pre@@ lude to the debate to be held in the committee , because it has examined how best to ensure that the necessary investments are made in power and in the energy sector in general , and which are the best ways to guarantee that investments are made and the system functions properly .
Finally , I welcome what might be called the holistic approach of the Barcelona process - its multidimen@@ sional nature .
The Commission seems to be heading the other way , towards a freer structure .
To my mind , an EU framework would be better .
Thirdly , would the financial speculators be forced to take their own losses rather than cruci@@ fying the Irish people ?
I find it wrong that the agricultural community should be ring @-@ fenced in a way that no other section of society is .
Is this a matter which is being given serious and active consideration by the President @-@ in@@ Office , and have proposals along those lines been prepared ?
Many of you also mentioned better reporting and better sorting .
Mr President , I would like to thank my colleague , Der@@ k Jan E@@ pp@@ ink , for his excellent report , but particularly to make a comment about the energy market , which the Commission is going to look at this year .
That is what we had in our country before the European Union destroyed our democracy , so get used to listening to opposition in this place .
I was amazed to hear senior American politicians talk bli@@ th@@ ely about Turkey joining the European Union , as if it was a very simple matter .
Mr President , the maritime sector is an important industry and employer in Europe .
In the United Kingdom there is a saying which goes there are three great lies in the world : &apos; the cheque is in the post &apos; ; &apos; it was not my fault &apos; ; and &apos; I am from the European Union and I am here to help &apos; .
Last week the Greek Government , which can ill afford to do so , paid the second instal@@ ment of a fine , now totalling over EUR 2 million for failure to comply with a judgment of the Court of Justice over the dumping of waste in Cre@@ te .
I had an extremely good visit to Syria , albeit too brief , earlier in the year , at which we significantly moved forward our dialogue on economic issues and on the assistance we can provide .
On the price of food as well as the quality and the variety available to our consumers ?
I agree with you , Commissioner Lamy , that the agriculture negotiations will be very important in determining whether or not the meetings in Cancun are a success .
However , the Commission counts on the active support of this Parliament , which I am sure will be forthcoming , in obtaining both the remaining EUR 92 million for 1999 and the additional funding which will be required in the coming years .
In fact , it is critical at this sensitive phase of integration that all sorts of minority opinions can organise themselves professionally to express themselves in an articu@@ late fashion .
Countries need long @-@ term predictable aid from external donors .
Between 2000 and 2005 it accounted for two thirds of Objective 2 funding .
The current draft agreements between the EU and the US on extradition and legal cooperation must not escape the parliamentary scrutiny provided for in our Treaties .
the farmers whom I represent in Lin@@ col@@ n@@ shire and in the East Midlands unanimously asked me to resist the proposals , and being practical people who grow our food their opinions should be respected .
The core principles of the regulation remain valid and relevant .
We enjoy very active collaboration in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and , again as Mr Cornillet says , the parliamentary nature of our work has notic@@ ea@@ bly increased .
. The honourable Member &quot; s question can be split into two parts .
Succ@@ ess in the war on terror rests on balancing freedom and security , not sacrifi@@ cing our civil liberties .
I believe that the World Health Organisation has taken the correct approach on this issue .
What a position for any government to put its own Ministers in !
Mr President , on Monday I made a point of order about President Nicole Fontaine &apos; s reported comments in the British press regarding her recent visit with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II .
Mr President , my congratulations to Mr Perry and to the Commission for bringing forward this report which is , as we know , very important and it points the way forward for the future .
Today &apos; s debate has already started the next debate , because ambition concerning the revision of financial instruments has been rather humble until now .
The Commission will issue a Green Paper this year to facilitate further development towards a framework for corporate social responsibility practice at European level .
There seems to be discrimination against people according to the tri@@ bes they come from .
As to the implementing rules , progress has already been made because in July 2005 the Commission amended the detailed rules for the implementation of Financial Regulation No 1 , which led , among others , to the following improvements in terms of simplified procedures .
The Commission is very disappointed that the second round of peace talks has now been put back indefinitely and that there are no prospects for new talks at the moment .
The review of communication into a single regulatory framework to be carried out by the Commission next year is to be welcomed .
The market forces stemming from a supply and demand approach will themselves re @-@ establish the balance between high consumption devices and the natural and consumer @-@ friendly development of brand new products .
I call on our Taoiseach , who was here in Parliament today , to ratify immediately both the Council of Europe Convention on Trafficking in Human Be@@ ings and the United Nations Protocol on Trafficking in Persons .
The Commission was , therefore , all the more concerned to learn about Mr Hu Jia &apos; s arbitrary detention and recalls that he has been subjected to repeated acts of harassment in the past due to human rights activities .
We are , of course , following developments closely .
While implementing these reforms has not always been easy , I am confident that we will be able to see their positive effects in the years ahead .
Peace @-@ building is our common duty .
We need to show that the creative measures really protect citizens and that they are proportionate to the infringement in the personal sphere .
There are also particular criteria that we ask the successful candidates to meet : we want to raise the European significance of the sites chosen ; the successful candidates will be expected to organise education events , especially for young people ; there will be an exchange of ideas on initiating common projects with other sites awarded the label ; there will be artistic and cultural activities which will foster dialogue ; and there will be access , of course , for the widest numbers of the public to visit these sites .
We were not able to discuss it or to debate it either in committee or in plenary , which is why I am drawing it to your attention now .
I would like to stress the three most important pillars of our policy towards Kosovo .
Member of the Commission . Mr President , although one and a half years have passed , the mass killings at Andijan on 13 May 2005 remain fresh in all our memories .
Inter@@ connection is not just developed by one Member State : you need at least two for this .
In@@ spec@@ tions in third countries are important .
Are we going to increase that level of aid for 2008 now that we have a direct involvement in it over the next 12 months ?
If you succeed in ratification , your name will be forever linked to an EU which cannot be understood by the public .
Mr President , I should like to answer succinc@@ tly as many as possible of the concerns and issues raised .
This is done in line with the principles I mentioned earlier through streamlined and improved cooperation , through common technical guidance and through a systematic search for best practices .
In the Commission &apos; s view it makes no sense to have different minimum rates depending on the point in time one or the other Member State joined the European Union .
However , the whole report as it stood is still unacceptable .
This strategy may have to be reviewed in the light of recent events .
The political crisis following the June 2009 parliamentary elections is deplorable .
The events of 11 September were an ex@@ cruci@@ ating fla@@ sh of light and we had to react immediately .
When people try to gather or make any sort of protest , they are , as we have seen , brutally attacked by the regime &apos; s police .
I accept that , being an island , the United Kingdom is going to be particularly disadvantaged by the removal of du@@ ty@@ free .
You have managed to maintain a high @-@ quality debate , taking into account very short deadlines for rather complicated legislation .
Since we are now on the brink of central and eastern enlargement , it seems to me that this period should be one for reflection as we bring in new countries , although possibly not a united Cyprus .
In particular , the joint statement of the last European Union @-@ Russia Summit in Moscow states our common aim of strengthening society , based on respect for democratic principles and human rights .
Member States &apos; National Action Plans must focus more on implementation .
Since when have the specifications for such national systems been available ?
It is the responsibility of governments to address that .
Perhaps not all of us are aware that there is a sort of Coreper in the European Parliament that fil@@ ters reports before they come to the Conference of Presidents , before they come into plenary .
In summary , the Commission can accept Amendments 1 , 6 , 7 and 8 , but cannot accept Amendments 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 .
This concept relies on the Commission &apos; s long experience in the field of competition , which enables it to as@@ certain what a share@@ holder &apos; s real power and influence are , for example by analysing the rights atta@@ ching to the share@@ holding and the agreements made between shareholders .
Finally , the programme supports cooperation between civil society and local authorities and activities to strengthen their capacity .
I believe it is our right to look at issues involving the Structural Funds and I understand you have also written to Member States .
It will encourage the development of energy @-@ efficient vehicle technology globally , and this is an extremely positive step .
That , as we are already seeing , will drive forward the agenda very rapidly .
The Commission considers that Ms Saberi &apos; s trial , held behind closed doors , did not meet the minimum standards required for a fair and transparent trial .
Maybe you could tell us , Commissioner , what has happened between 10 March and today ?
All of them are already bil@@ in@@ gu@@ al .
Environmental legislation based on design criteria , I put it to you colleagues , is without precedent , and for good reason .
The WTO does still have a significant role to play in the world and still plays its role well , but it needs to be modernised and reformed .
I think that Ms Pil@@ lay , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , whom I met in Geneva , is giving exactly the right direction politically in order to make a difference on the ground .
This directive would of course not affect that , but it could potentially remove places where people could get those instruments re@@ paired and maintained .
Among most observers , there is a growing consensus that more needs to be done about the political and socioeconomic situation .
These duties are sometimes as high as 90 % in the case of Lesotho and this , of course , will affect these countries &apos; ability to spend on essential health and education and other social needs .
However , the rations remained adequate in view of the fact that many refugees have access to additional sources of food .
The situation is absolutely unacceptable and I am going to start by making a confession .
Where we do , too little of it is converted into market product and services .
Under the new rules all Burmese military officers of the rank of briga@@ dier @-@ general and above will be barred from entering the European Union .
We have a right to tell the Russians that we demand standards of them with regard to freedom of expression , freedom of accountability and the freedom and the security of human life when people question and challenge authority .
We adopted the proposal on the Statu@@ tes of the Agency in the spring of this year .
In order to achieve this we want more transparency , better regulation , a renov@@ ated and functioning grid , a European energy strategy , debate on self @-@ sufficiency and solidarity between Member States , and rules that enable consumers to decide on their own consumption in a workable way .
Within three years , and a dollar crash , the Mark was back to DEM 1.@@ 57 during December 1987 .
This will mean that the practice in certain countries , where you pay as much to transport energy for 200 metres from a co @-@ generation unit to a neighbour as you pay to transport energy for over 500 kilometres will change and this will give small gener@@ ators a real chance .
However , whilst we have agreed on the establishment plan , the Committee on Budgets voted for one third of those posts in reserve , albeit by a one @-@ vote majority .
However , in the report we published recently on the functioning of the transitional arrangements , the Commission pointed out that flows from the EU @-@ 10 , the new Member States , had been fairly limited in relation to the overall working @-@ age population and that they are balanced , at least in part , by mobility from the original 15 .
in writing . - I support the general approach of Klaus @-@ He@@ iner Lehne &apos; s report on the transparency of institutional investors .
I do not like the idea of introducing a ban which is introduced by a very narrow majority .
Parliament was expecting the Commission &apos; s implementing proposals on the directive at the end of last year .
Parliament should welcome the 14@@ th EU @-@ Russia Summit in the Hague while regret@@ ting , however , that it has been a failure as far as substantial progress on the establishment of the four common spaces is concerned .
Nevertheless , I am still concerned about the limited means at the disposal of the European Union to police such deals .
Faced with the enor@@ m@@ ity of problems concerning the environment , she once said that we cannot cry about everything all the time .
Can I ask you , Commissioner , to perhaps take this analysis that the Irish Farmers &apos; Association has completed - and I will raise it again , because it is in full colour - and come back to me and tell me , I hope , that they have got it wrong , although I fear that they have got it right .
This will also be an important theme at the World Food Summit in Rome .
ECHO services decided on funding once an initial evaluation of the hur@@ ricane damage had been carried out in Cuba .
The Commission , working closely with the Presidency , had identified three practical steps forward , and we received support for them all .
Indeed , I am happy to say that in most Member States I know this system already applies .
Beli@@ eve me , despite the fact that most members of my group are from non @-@ euro zone member countries , we do not want the euro to fail .
The Kyrgy@@ z Constitution was amended in a controversial referendum in 1996 , and in 2003 there was another referendum which approved further constitutional change .
But children in a school are the most innocent victims of all .
Please come and exercise the solidarity that has so often been mentioned today .
The Lisbon Treaty has therefore been a missed opportunity .
. Madam President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for his work .
Animal welfare is also a &apos; non @-@ trade concern &apos; that has to be defended and explained during the WTO negotiations .
Nevertheless , I regret that both the Council and the Commission rejected Parliament &apos; s amendments providing for the organisation of school competi@@ tions which would have allowed winning schools to attend the next Olympic Games in Greece .
Will the presidency recognise that there are certain forms of crime which are naturally cross @-@ border issues ?
This is to be done &apos; in the interests of a more joined @-@ up procedure &apos; , and the other vital reason quoted is to help reduce complexity .
We really hope that in the European Council next week you will come back to this question and that the prime ministers of the Member States will give some binding character to this Small Business Act .
The annual payment that some of the tobacco growers get is , in fact , more than the value of the land that tobacco is grown on .
We will identify areas for further work , to examine , and address clearly , evidenced shortcomings in existing regulatory protections .
The Union must play a role in the world that matches its economic weight , so we must ensure coherence in our external action .
I think we first need to do the analysis of what functions we need to perform .
I do not believe that this is a good way to proceed .
This exclusion is specified in essential safety requirements and will be taken up in a mandate which the Commission will give to the European Stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation Committee after the adoption of the directive .
It is not that we are not aware of the problem .
EU legislation in this field is necessary .
Is there proper fostering in place and are there pending cases still unresolved ?
The remaining closures by Israel are having devastating effects on the Palestinian economy and therefore , not surprisingly , on political stability .
Mr President , European citizens are gravely concerned about the effects of climate change and support a low @-@ carbon , clean energy provision for our future .
But those of us who advocate multilateralism also bear a responsibility : to ensure that it produces practical , effective and timely results .
Equally , Russia &apos; s reaction was disproportionate .
At present , we have more or less three options .
It is also participating in the main international efforts deployed , notably in the framework of the international contact group set up recently by the African Union .
Perhaps this debate on MS will lead to some wiser thinking and be the catalyst for changing this unsatisfactory and , in many respects , shameful state of affairs for the benefit of our citizens .
V@@ ot@@ ers cannot , therefore , be expected to make an informed choice between candidates of the same party .
I understand that there are regular checks carried out , but in this case there were clearly some gaps in the checks on that market .
It must be seen , and I want it acknowledged , as a departure from European law and practice .
We can contribute to the discussion about reducing the greenhouse effect more than anyone else and that is why we need to do it , but we need to do it wisely , securing the opportunities for growth and investment and high @-@ tech , because otherwise we will not be able to meet the challenges of climate change when it comes .
I wish you the best of luck in your efforts .
They are entitled to vote in European elections but they found that in the last elections they had all sorts of problems : a British citizen living in Germany said that there are 6 000 non @-@ German nationals entitled to vote in their district , but that only 40 did so because they had inadequate information ; a Dutch citizen made exactly the same point in a petition about the situation in France .
So I would rather hope that this policy , as some have said , is really supported by you .
When we signed this together and we held a press conference , I said that I had confidence in the signatories .
Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world .
If the EU did not exist we would need to invent one , but not under the draft constitution and not in its current form .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Madam President , several very serious and important issues have been raised .
After this crisis , I think there is now much more awareness of the need to have real coordination in the response to the crisis .
But EU legislation on TDI already goes beyond WTO requirements in many ways .
It demands , for example , that Kurdish women &apos; s groups be explicitly recognised as such : a deliberate provocation to Ankara , which has long maintained that all Turkish citizens are equal before the Constitution .
I have personally been involved in Europe &apos; s support for UNHCR for UN aids .
Having said that , I am delighted that Mr Spencer has been critical of Parliament .
It does not have to be the same standby group for each six months , it could change with the Presidency , but there should be a standby group so that we can deliver aid under a humanitarian EU flag .
We adopt legislation in the European Union .
There were only three or four people in the Chamber .
We are hopeful that progress can be extended to other tracks in due course .
I should have said that I want to congratulate Mr Miranda on his report .
Im@@ migrant women are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and social exclusion .
Life expectancy is now 35 years .
Their dreams are not complicated .
However , the people who have had their cars im@@ pou@@ nded have still not received any redress for the loss that they have suffered .
Both sides have to realise that there can be no military solution to this conflict .
Secondly , one of the most important tools at our disposal for raising human rights issues with third countries is the human rights dialogues .
Can we see legislative programmes directed towards that ?
The Association Agreement with Israel provides for exactly that .
However , we all know that the Bush Administration uses all sorts of exceptions and exemptions to the Priv@@ acy Act , which , incidentally , affects American citizens as it does European citizens .
In a way that presents us with a dilemma in Parliament .
Unfortunately , as we see the developing chaos and threats of famine and the destruction of the economy , we can but mour@@ n the fact that he did not fulfil the hopes we had of him .
When I was deputy chairman of the Sta@@ f@@ fordshire Development Association two key problems emerged in dealing with small businesses .
Following the adoption of this regulation , the Commission is resolved to work closely with the Member States to ensure and closely monitor the full implementation of the bluefin tuna recovery plan .
It is not easy but we should try and I hope in early December I will be able to tell you what we propose .
We are dealing here with three separate aspects : cruelty , consumer fraud and recently we discovered that these pel@@ ts are toxic as well .
If you are a relatively low @-@ paid parent of a young child , who has to buy new footwear regularly , this imposition is a serious one and I regret that we have taken this action .
Let us accept that , despite earlier assurances from Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia and others , there will be further financial failures in the European Union , and real economies in the EU will be affected by the credit crisis .
It is a Community @-@ wide measure . It applies to all Member States .
The Commission proposed general rules on impact assessment in its communication of 5 June 2002 .
President , the honourable Member will understand that it is difficult and probably inappropriate for the Commission to speculate on hypoth@@ es@@ es and possibilities .
I am not sure that the administration has actually raised it with the College of Quaestors , which would be the correct body to refer the matter to .
Any change to the entry price system and its current application mechanism could have a detrimental impact on the results achieved so far .
However , the persistence of a higher termination rate would not be justified after a period long enough for an operator to adapt to market conditions and become efficient , unless there are objective cost differences which are beyond the control of the operators concerned .
. Mr President , at last we have a compromise package on the table and this is of huge importance to climate policy within the European Union and across the world .
Your report considers several pro@@ s and cons of a system where legal expenses would be compul@@ sor@@ ily covered , EU @-@ wide , by the motor insurance policy of the liable party .
Therefore , I must reluctantly support Swedish , Dutch and Austrian workers being supported from it .
The limited extension of Annex H , proposed by the Commission , is intended to reduce the discrepancies between Member States rather than increase them , in line with the objectives of the internal market .
This poet is the symbol of Palestinian patrio@@ tism .
One of the Members gave the example of the woman who did not want to wear a bur@@ k@@ ha .
In particular the Commission must clarify how the rules relating to over@@ flying will be applied in practice .
What it should do , however , is protect and help people in circumstances where restructuring has made them redundant or left them facing difficulties within the labour market .
We will need to reflect further on this important subject .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report which will provide funding for person@@ alised measures to help workers who have been made redundant in the Czech Republic .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I would like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office and the Commissioner for their intervention but also in particular our rapporteur , Ms Martens , for her work on this issue , because the reality is that we are dealing with a new partnership , a new arrangement between the European Union and Africa .
What would stop migration of citizens to stronger economies in the Union under laws of the EU &apos; s own creation ?
in writing . - I could not vote in favour of the Car@@ ner@@ o report but did not wish to give support to a Eurosceptic point of view either .
On this dossier the Council not only failed to even consider compromise or indeed conciliation , but arrog@@ antly set about accu@@ sing Parliament of putting passenger security at risk .
When I questioned the nonsense of this procedure , I was assured that it was required under Schengen rules .
Secondly , we agreed to accelerate fiscal consolidation in those Member States where it is most urgently needed .
Of more immediate concern to my electors who are suffering from enlargement fatigue is the scale of organised crime and corruption in Croatia , which the Government must truly make it a national priority to eradicate .
I am sure other colleagues in the Commission will address these matters .
But this speech is not about me : this speech is about you and about your activity .
It means that e @-@ money must be re@@ deemed for cash on request minus any de@@ ductions for legitimate costs in carrying out the transactions .
Better safety and more environmentally sensitive and sensible proposals are always welcome .
in writing . - I welcome the European Court of Auditors &apos; 2006 Annual Report as it identifies welcome improvements , particularly in relation to agricultural spending .
Please take back to your colleagues the fact that this Parliament believes that it is utterly unacceptable that that legislative proposal is constantly delayed .
In return for this greater degree of autonomy , managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions .
Mr President , I think everybody in this Parliament supports the fight against terrorism .
Mr President , I would like to draw attention to the complete dis@@ array regarding free movement of citizens from the new Member States .
Does the Commission raise issues relating to investment protection , especially in the energy sector , in its negotiations with the Russian Federation on the new partnership and cooperation agreement ?
Xerox is one particular example of an all too common problem .
Their heartfelt but often conflicting demands and aspirations can only be tackled successfully by working together to generate consensus and unity .
The amendment , which has been put down in my name and others , calls for a negotiated settlement of this dispute , which is World Trade Organisation compatible .
The new countries have a right to criticise the European Union .
Belarus , as we know , is included as one of the six Eastern Partnership countries , a move aimed at creating positive development trends in our eastern European neighbourhood .
Lastly , I would direct a remark towards Mrs Kauppi .
This is also relevant to a number of different amendments which refer to conditional sentences .
Hea@@ ded &apos; Tal@@ k of emergencies misses the point &apos; , the article discussed the situation in Africa .
Despite all that money , the yards and the future of the workers remain vulnerable .
At their meeting 10 days ago , the Heads of State and Government were clear that we have to make the maximum possible use of the single market as the engine for recovery .
If , however , any serious shortcomings are observed in the fulfilment by Romania of its commitments and in particular any of the specific commitments listed in the EU position , this can form the basis for invoking the safeguard clause postponing Romania &apos; s accession by one year .
However , this is not necessary , as the same directive allows , under Article 3 ( 2 ) , for Member States to apply exemptions on national waterways and issue bo@@ at@@ master &apos; s certificates under their own conditions .
We kept in mind that this was only an own @-@ initiative report without legal consequences .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , Baroness Ashton , the elections will not be free and fair in Iraq .
Allow me to state , moreover , that the EU is not introducing a tax policy by means of this proposal .
The channels will be open for dialogue , if that is what both parties want .
And we must all work towards this goal .
The report expresses Europe &apos; s wish to reduce the Union &apos; s innovation deficit and achieve the goal set at Lisbon and , hence , does a great deal to help improve the EU &apos; s overall competitiveness .
I call on the Commission to be clear and decisive in its push for implementation of the necessary security measures to control money laundering and the financing of terrorism .
I support closer cooperation and coordination on justice within the EU , although I would caution governments to look very carefully at any conditions attached to future initiatives .
Over@@ laps and dupli@@ cations with other processes should be more limited , in particular , through coordination between the employment strategy and the broad economic policy guidelines .
The gun@@ men tied him and his wife to a chair and , as she plea@@ ded for their lives , the Bri@@ ga@@ de member told her : &apos; His time has come &apos; .
M@@ ention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation , reduced from three years to one year : Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges within that time .
I think it has highlighted the clear unanimity that we have when it comes to defending our values , but it has also highlighted some of the difficult choices and balancing acts that we have to engage in in the months and years ahead .
However , speaking as a British Member of the European Parliament there were enormous difficulties about these directives , particularly the Large Comb@@ us@@ tion Pl@@ ants Directive .
We simply want evidence that a partnership pact is going to be an operation with local authorities , with NGOs and , indeed , with the social partners .
However , I am not here to discuss what should be agreed among competent Members of the Commission and the International Monetary Fund with the participation of the Greek authorities .
As you know , this review is part of the global Europe framework policy that I launched last year , which is explicitly intended to put EU trade policy at the service of this growth and job strategy .
There was no need to create super @-@ systems , and this is clearly spelled out in the amendments .
Is that not a fair question , given the time we have been negotiating ?
And to all those who came from Eastern Europe in the hope of getting money , I am sorry , but the cheque is not in the post !
Subject : Great Britain , Sweden and the euro
I have already referred to the regular dialogue between European Parliament and the ECB , the trans@@ crip@@ ts of which are published on the websites of our institutions .
This Parliament &quot; s procedures leave us in a position of weakness .
It is very clear that the Union can intervene here .
Initi@@ ally , the Council was reluctant to provide this information which is why the text , as it stands at the moment , postpon@@ es discharge for the Council .
We are in very close contact with the Greek authorities and with the international community , and if there is a need and a request from Greece , then I am sure the whole eurozone and the Commission would mobilise and come to the rescue of that country .
I will say this quite bluntly : if the Commission cannot run the common fisheries policy properly , then send it back to the Member States and let them do it .
But why not take advantage of that straight away ?
I will open my blo@@ g with a warning to citizens not to use such kinds of mal@@ practices and be aware of European City Guide &apos; s mal@@ practices , but this is in the hands of the Member States to implement the possible protection .
This project receives a European Union contribution of EUR 12@@ .5 million .
On rural development , I would like to say to Mrs McGuinness that we share a common vision .
Should we be surprised that they wanted to do that on the grounds that they have only 0.@@ 4 % of the share of world trade ?
I was recently in Washington having meetings with the members of the Congress .
Surely it is desirable that the Union avoids putting itself inside such a strait@@ jacket .
Hopefully , there will be a big majority tomorrow in the plenary and that will send a signal to the people of these two countries that the elected Members of the European Parliament strongly support their wish to travel more freely in the European Union .
Training more health workers worldwide is only part of the solution .
Col@@ lec@@ tively we must defend our rights to choose when and how to engage , or isolate , regimes such as those in Cuba , Libya , Iran or elsewhere .
I brought this matter to the Commission &apos; s attention especially and gave the information needed on what has happened because I would like the Commission to take a position and to tell us , as Members of Parliament , if it agrees with this kind of state subsidy or not . If it does not it should take immediate measures .
The moratorium is clearly supported by the whole Hungarian scientific community , all political parties and Hungarian society .
In this way low standards become the norm .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , the massive fuel oil price increases we are talking about today may well be the straw that breaks the cam@@ el &apos; s back for many British fishermen .
Farm@@ ing is in transition as never before .
I had the opportunity to thank Minister Sán@@ dor P@@ inté@@ r , the Hungarian Minister of the Interior in charge of civil protection , for all the efforts of the various services involved and for the bra@@ very and dedication of the first respon@@ ders .
Their implementation to national policies , together with continuing structural reform , will help improve the situation of vulnerable groups in the labour market , which include the young , the elderly , the long @-@ term unemployed and people with low qualifications .
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States .
Member of the Commission . - I would be in the 35 % camp , because it is important that , if we put requirements that completely ban biofuels from the market and there is too high a risk of leverage , we will move to oil - and deeper - and perhaps to coal and liquid technology .
Can I ask Mr Prodi whether in principle , subject to Parliament and the Commission being able to formal@@ ise appropriate arrangements , it would be possible to do this regularly ?
Mr President , the floor is yours .
If only the hunger of this Chamber for new powers were matched by its interest in exercising properly the powers it already has - above all to hold the executive to account and to keep spending under control .
In early 2000 concrete information on specific imports from Israeli settlements was supplied to the Commission .
In ordinary language , the installations concerned are the cable cars , the fu@@ ni@@ cular railways and ski lifts used in mountain resor@@ ts , all used where access is difficult .
It would be interesting to know whether the Commission backs this idea or whether the Commission itself has it in mind to tackle the incidence not simply of lead pi@@ ping for the water suppliers but the lead pi@@ ping in homes .
Green taxes such as reduced VAT rates can also have a similar effect , by stimulating demand for low consumption vehicles and domestic appliances .
That said , despite good progress , much remains to be done .
They provide for conditions linked to the granting of Union assistance .
The joint action will focus on prevention - an area which Parliament underlines in this report - and also on improving knowledge and data and sharing good practices .
If we have a dynamic St Petersburg , then the Baltic itself will be dynamic and that even reflects on trade in the area I know best - the north @-@ east coast of the United Kingdom .
Thirdly , the problem of the size of the UK fleet .
There cannot be any immunity for anyone from such prosecution .
There is also the question of the composition of the expert groups .
In@@ ser@@ ting it into the proposal would mean that we would have to find another legal basis other than the CAP Articles 36 and 37 of the Treaty .
In this area , there is much to be done in terms of prevention .
It is clear that patients want this right , and that they deserve this right and are entitled to this right .
I indicated at the beginning of Question Time that I wanted to do so .
Only in this way will we get real change in the relationship with Turkey .
I have one final brief remark to make .
Furthermore , consumers may end up paying higher prices than would otherwise be the case in a situation of cost @-@ based sym@@ metric termination rates .
This new agreement , which I welcome , will introduce mandatory safety features , such as seals and seri@@ al numbers for prescription medicines . This will allow for their traceability .
Nobody but a fantas@@ ist would suggest such a thing .
It will have to ask loan promot@@ ers to consult local stakeholders before deciding on projects .
The same thing is happening in Ireland .
I hope that we can improve trade relations with Japan and I look forward to further progress in these relations .
Your view is absolutely right .
This is a matter on which the European Court of Human Rights has registered its protest and noted that this is a violation of Article 2 .
In light of what the Commissioner has said about the need for greater judicial and police cooperation , would the Commission consider taking an initiative to create a European @-@ wide sex offenders register , so that these people can be monitored ?
And that is the key point .
I did not hear anything about this from Mr Schulz earlier today .
As the Commissioner has said , there are lessons which the UN , NATO and Europe will have to learn for the future .
I hope I shall be able to respond to paragraphs 6 and 8 in particular , concerning governance and institution @-@ building in Somalia and protection of humanitarian relief and humanitarian relief workers , as he asked me to do .
Would the President @-@ in @-@ Office agree with me that if the Council were to set these clear benchmarks , which we have laid out in our resolution , then we would avoid ris@@ king acquies@@ cence in the process which Abacha is so clearly engaged in and that will result in a civilian g@@ love covering the military fist that Abacha has applied for so long ?
I also thank those that have made constructive critical remarks about the work of the Ombudsman .
We , for our part , will keep strongly to our opinion that the agreement will be signed only when Serbia shows results in cap@@ turing the remaining war criminals .
The response to such a dire situation should be prompt and effective .
Some people do not consider that to be a human right , but I believe in fact that it is and represents another step forward that we should welcome .
Still , money is needed regardless of the source , and we need to more or less mo@@ p up resources to do what needs to be done in Afghanistan .
I say to the Commission : questions will be asked and answers sought if this recovery programme is used as some form of co@@ vert operation to introduce a secondary decommissioning programme .
In other words , were Member States &quot; regulators in other countries informed as soon as possible ?
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans , Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation .
The European Union and the international community should strongly support economic , social and political reconstruction .
There is no reason for it : there is an adequate Parliament building in Brussels .
But we also see reports from the European Environment Agency that there are many instances of Member States still failing to enforce the legislation as effectively and as adequately as should be the case .
I fully endorse the focus given by the Rapporteur to the challenges posed to EU industry by the rapid growth of the Chinese economy in both un@@ skilled labour @-@ intensive industry as well as high @-@ tech dom@@ ains .
It is not an advers@@ arial situation where we are trying to score points off one another ; instead we are actually trying to get a budget which we can all agree to and this adjustment of the financial perspective .
The Commission plans to send a letter to all the Member States recalling their obligations under Community law and asking Member States to provide the details of any national measures that might be introduced for the first two years that follow the accession of Bulgaria and Romania .
I hope that , in this case , ASEAN will act rather more vigorously in the future than it has in the recent past .
It also takes account of the most important amendments at first reading .
There is plenty of basic research and knowledge about parasites and gen@@ om@@ es , but there needs to be more bridging research to translate basic research into tested and safe drugs and clinical applications .
This is a condition without which negotiations with non @-@ member countries are impossible .
The Commission has proposed a horizontal directive for several different reasons .
While we , the Greens / EFA , co @-@ signed a number of amendments with the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs , we were the only ones to try to introduce criticism of the current model of drug development based on patents , which leads to high prices for medical innovation and lack of access to affordable essential medicines .
We do have the rapporteur on the climate here , Mrs Doyle , who will be listening to all of this .
I doubt very much that they could .
The Commission is convinced that further work , in close cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council , will finally lead to a balanced solution within the context of conciliation .
The second thing I will pass on is that this is an exercise in consultation which is not the end of a process but the beginning .
The European Union has also made through your presidency a wise choice in insisting that the reform process in the Treaties must be over and operational by the year 2002 so that it will facilitate early accession because it is important to ensure that the reform process should not become the enemy of the enlargement process .
The changes we need , require fundamental cooperation across Member States of a kind that education ministers , vice @-@ chan@@ cel@@ lors of universities and national qualification agencies find enormously difficult .
Only 42 % of West Bank territory is controlled by the Palestinians , 58 % is either in military camps or settlements and too often the military camps lead to the settlements .
And finally , you can use national money in order to organise or to implement social policies in the area .
It is a point that is a very serious national problem for Ireland .
There are different stra@@ ta in both groupings .
They take a European law and when they transpose it into national law , they add things which have been sitting in a dra@@ wer in a ministry .
Neither this Parliament nor the Commission have any competence in this area .
I also agreed both with him and with Minister Roche when they spoke of the need to develop a modern interpretation of the Geneva Convention on refugees .
We were promised many things : the new Presidency was going to simplify the burdens on business , reduce red tape and provide leadership to make the EU more relevant to the people .
There have been many discussions in the Convention - which rol@@ ls on under its distinguished presidency - about the future of the common foreign and security policy , discussions in which I have taken part myself , discussions about the use of qualified majority voting , discussions about double @-@ hat@@ ting ; all this and much more : it has been an extremely exciting ride for all of us who have taken part .
This help can come from us in different shap@@ es and forms .
We can only work together on that .
As you said , the solution must be lasting , fair and legally viable .
It is about time that France obe@@ yed the rules .
We should learn from that experience .
Commissioner , would you agree that it is of paramount importance that we have a European solution to this problem and would you accept our congratulations that you have put your best efforts towards that in the events over the weekend .
By way of contrast , I have to express my regret at one or two wrec@@ king amendments , particularly Amendment 39 , which I think , rather mis@@ chiev@@ ously - but perhaps deliberately - goes in exactly the opposite direction from the intention and role of the Agency and the whole Euratom Treaty .
In addition , last June the Commission decision implementing the regulation establishing the anti @-@ fraud office , OLAF , explicitly made the provision that officials and servants of the Commission , and I quote , &quot; who become aware of evidence which gives rise to the presumption of the existence of possible cases of fraud , corruption or any other illegal activities detrimental to the interest of the Communities &quot; are obliged to inform their hierarchy or the Secretary @-@ General or the Director of the European anti @-@ fraud office , OLAF .
We did not want to give the wrong message and it was better to give no message following the debate that we had , very fully covering the various points , last time .
This is an area where Europe has so much to offer , but the whole engagement needs to be stepped up and integrated with an overall development policy .
The quality of monetary statistics has recently been further improved by identifying , as a separate item , non @-@ resident holdings of money market funds .
If you look at Paris Charles De Gaulle , Schi@@ pho@@ l , Frankfurt and London Heathrow all together , the conclusion might be , for instance , that there was no justification for a third run@@ way at Heathrow .
Finally , a very brief point on mutual recognition .
The second fight is much more continuous and shar@@ per .
Mr President , I must say that I am slightly disturbed by the lack of response on one or two of the issues there , but I will come to those in one moment .
I therefore join you today in supporting this initiative to recognise 11 July as the day of the commemoration of the Srebrenica genocide .
Without their help and work we would not have been able to bring this work to fruition .
in writing . - Mr President , I congratulate Ms Hall on this report , which contains a number of sold , sensible , achievable suggestions to encourage energy efficiency .
I agree with you on the need to take more decisive action in this field .
The st@@ alling of the talks in Seattle gives us an opportunity to do just that .
To others in this House , constructive criticism of Turkey is needed ; we ourselves are critical friends .
We now have interactive markets , and very young children - not only young adults - spend a large portion of their time online , sometimes even more than in front of the television .
I would like to pay tribute to his many achievements on behalf of European citizens .
Taking place at the same time was a meeting of the acquis group on the common frame of reference .
Frontex cannot be a substitute for a comprehensive migration system - which we still do not have - which covers illegal immigration and legal migration and which has proper legal migration channels , as well as preserving the asylum channel .
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme .
This is the stark reality of a market which is held back , not just by the slow evolution of debt @-@ raising , but also by the nature of the institutional and regulatory barriers which fence in any further development across the European Union .
We have failed them , failed to give them the proper tools of knowledge and information to be able to cooperate and deal with the new opportunities that are available .
Subject : Energy @-@ saving light bulbs
The Socialist Group and I voted against those proposals because the interests of consumers are vital to us .
- Mr Vondra , many colleagues have thanked the Czech Presidency for its contribution .
Further action needs to be based on the careful assessment of the benefits and the costs .
Every day , enormous amounts of personal data are captured , sorted and processed .
The EU voice must be heard .
You have all our good wishes .
Sus@@ pension of agreements with those countries would follow if the clause was contraven@@ ed .
Three times I have followed up with telephone calls and again received no reply .
We will have done our work in terms of contributing ideas and proposals to the Convention and that in itself is very important .
President Barroso has been frank ; it is time for EU leaders to back him .
Mr President , I also congratulate Mr Bösch on his report .
Currently , the joint aviation authorities seek to achieve cabin crew safety by placing responsibility for safety throughout an airline clearly on the operator .
Our main objective was , and is , to have a small , functional Board which , through the balance of its membership , can be seen to be independent , yet accountable to the Community institutions .
A good and credible monetary policy is certainly a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation , but not a sufficient condition by itself .
An early draft of the Council conclusions committed Member States to a 10 % reduction in energy use in government buildings and car fleets , yet now reads simply as &apos; substantial progress &apos; .
I wish we had more power , but at least we can use that little bit of pressure to bring about results for citizens .
. The article on which this question is based contains a number of in@@ accu@@ racies that could mislead the read@@ er .
Mr President , Commissioner , colleagues , if I may begin on a personal note it is now nearly two years since I was campaigning on an election platform that stressed the need for proper statutes for Members and their assistants .
I am increasingly of the view that to understand what Parliament &apos; s Bureau actually does and decides you have to be a K@@ rem@@ lin@@ olog@@ ist to read their minutes and get any meaning out of them .
The word &apos; historic &apos; might well be appropriate to describe this development .
Member States remain responsible for the conduct and supervision of intelligence operations , unless the Council decides otherwise .
Can the Commissioner inform the House of the volume of meat and meat products entering the Community from third countries and the health status of these products - it may be a question that he may not be in a position to answer straight away - and can he also inform the House of the position on the use of meat @-@ and @-@ bone meal in animal feed in those exporting countries and the extent to which this now international problem can be addressed in the context of world trade ?
I want Member States who are compliant to be able to protect their consumers and their producers by being able to ban imports of illegally produced eggs from those producers and countries which are not compliant .
I am aware of the creation of an association bringing together owners of vessels under 10 metres long in the UK fleet .
For this reason , the proposal provides for a standard level in the veterinary sector .
But that is not for next year .
This is not simply a re@@ heating or recycling of the 1996 budget debate .
Most importantly it invited Parliament and the Council , as well as all other interested stakeholders , to provide their views on forest protection and information and on the way forward so that the EU could provide added value to the work going on at Member State level and more widely across Europe .
By all means have your Treaty , but let the people decide on their future .
The participation in the election observation of a team of nine Members of the European Parliament , led by Mr Si@@ wi@@ ec , was an important contribution .
In European terms , we also need a European Union decision @-@ making process .
It will give confidence that , whatever the challenges ahead for economic and monetary union , the European Union can sur@@ mount them , and it shows that Parliament is a serious and responsible legislature and partner in economic reform .
Unfortunately , though this report contains some good points , it did not go far enough to cover this destruc@@ tural deficit we experienced by lagging so far behind the rest of Europe after over 30 years of terrorist violence .
Regional cooperation should help in this .
Subject : The EU &apos; s alcohol strategy
That is the only way to address such a complex and difficult issue .

In the European Parliament , the name Daphne stands for an important initiative .
The reason for the variation in distribution of the direct payments is connected with historical production .
We talk about the report , which is about sound financial management .
This will be a cartel , and to face this cartel we need stricter laws .

Since then , we have followed closely the efforts of the government to deal with new outbreaks of violence , including the arrest on 4 May of J@@ a &apos; far U@@ mar Th@@ ali@@ b on charges of incitement to violence .
I cannot see how it is possible to amend it now or to ask for more derogations .
The best hope for the future may be universal education , which will not change current attitudes but rather those of the next generation .
Regarding monitoring , the EU relies in its judgments , in particular with regard to the initiation of any withdrawal procedure , on the monitoring procedures and expertise of relevant specialised monitoring bodies , such as the ILO , for which the EU itself cannot be a substitute .
I wish the Presidency all the best for the next six months .
It seems to me that we have not learned our lesson from the experience of the weak delivery of the Lisbon Strategy .
But it is an issue that should be dealt with in a horizontal manner , at the proper level and in the proper context .
That will happen here if we do not take a progressive position .
It is my view that it is a false saving and a false protection of flexibility .
For example , some of the issues and challenges relating to fish diseases , dioxin levels and so forth are very specific and require regularly updated and verifiable scientific advice on which to base controls and tox@@ in levels .
It should also facilitate the preparations for the 1998 budget .
I abstained on some paragraphs in this report which were contradictory or whose implications have not been fully worked out .
I have to say to the House that this is a radical change from the original cod and hake recovery plan that we considered and I believe that , under Article 37 of the Treaty , we have a right to be consulted in this House on these revised proposals .
There may be various explanations of a technical sort and I should be interested if so , to hear them .
The idea and the reality of Europe is the idea of mobility , of freedom of movement for goods and for people .
I have said many times before that if the EU is the answer then the question must have been a stupid one .
For example , the outbreak is already being attributed to poor controls on imports and the intensive nature of agricultural production in the European Union .
This is very much due to the excellent work of Commissioner Rehn .
The sooner we take steps to make structural and substantive improvements to that text and address public concern , the better .
They must act to provide a Europe @-@ wide code of conduct for the advertising industry in order for this discrimination to be stopped .
So , needless to say , we have had a very short time , but we think it is an important debate ; afterwards , there will , of course , be a lot of details that we have to look at more closely .
At all costs we must avoid a restructuring that protects beet producers at the expense of cane producers and I would hope that the Commission will ensure that this does not happen , whilst still being fair to our own farmers .
In November last year , here in Strasbourg , when we were discussing the approval of four previous macro @-@ financial assistance proposals regarding other countries , the Commission promised us that , under the Lisbon Treaty and until the adoption of a framework regulation for macro @-@ financial assistance , all future individual proposals for such assistance would be subject to codecision by Parliament and the Council .
The first asks the Commission not to neglect the specific needs of mixed fisheries , whilst the second calls for measures to encourage environmentally @-@ friendly and smaller @-@ scale fisheries .
In the cases of France and Spain , the Commission decided last July to institute proceedings before the Court of Justice if no satisfactory solution was forthcoming in the near future .
Lastly , I say to Mr Corbett : yes , I have got a political point of interest in this matter .
It is fair to point out that the most recent report by the Court of Auditors for the year 1998 has not drawn attention to any single major failure of the Commission in this entire area .
The Egyptian portfolio is one of the largest in the EIB .
One point we have to stress is that we need to get over to the Council and , indeed , the wider community why this measure is so important .
And what hope can you hold out to an organization such as this in the future when the board of the organization itself is likely to say ; &apos; why bother to apply for something which is so badly handled ? &apos;
I do not think that is good enough given the appalling vis@@ ta we have before us of job losses in these areas .
In case I did not make myself clear , let me underline the fact that the Commission is exceptionally concerned by particular cases of the abuse of human rights , including the situation affecting women .
First stability or peace , then governance , then democratisation and then democracy itself .
The European Union is committed to the absolute prohibition of torture and of cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment .
The popular support of President Lukashenko dimin@@ ishes , and the regime - as a reaction - gets more and more oppressive .
As my esteemed colleague Mr Hughes has said , this is a matter for Council and we should not use it as a delaying or blocking tactic .
The second milestone is the authorisation by the Council , again last week , of the opening of the negotiations on association agreements with Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
So , too , will be the contribution of the European Council .
In the last two weeks the same laboratory has been the protagon@@ ist in what appears to be another fiasco .
The EU has very ambitious legislation in this field which needs now to be reviewed .
In fact , it is becoming an extremely difficult matter .
I wish to assure you that there is concern to ensure the maximum protection of consumers in respect of the consumption of all food , including beef .
Together with the Member States , the Commission has been conducting a mapping exercise on common principles and elements of healthcare in the European Union . Special attention was paid to patients &apos; rights .
I believe , as does the Committee on Fisheries , that it is important for Community fishermen that this agreement be renewed after 31 December of this year when the current prolongation expires .
The women who found work needed , after 30 years of service in this plant , to begin again at minimum wage , as they had not been given any continuous training and their previous experience went un@@ recognised .
How do we say &apos; abstention &apos; ?
But many of the people protesting throughout the European Union and throughout the world , and making their voice heard , consider that George W. Bush is a threat not to his own people but rather to the world at large .
It would otherwise have had a very distorting effect on the energy market across Europe .
Mr President , in 10 years in this Chamber I have listened to an awful lot of hum@@ bu@@ g , but I do not think I have ever heard such un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated pi@@ ff@@ le as I heard in the debate on this report yesterday from Pal@@ eo @-@ feder@@ alists such as Mr Brok and Mr Corbett , can@@ ting about the sovereignty of national parliaments as though they ca@@ red about it .
All are involved in the whole procedure and doing their utmost to make it a good proposal .
Why is the fear of a two @-@ state solution , of Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace , so dread@@ ed by some that they prefer to inflict pain and suffering on their own people ?
How is it possible that the voting list is so short ?
The report and motion for a resolution make several proposals on the role of Community development cooperation in respect of ICT .
In the longer term you are quite right that the growth of employment necessary to sustain our living standards and the European social model is critically dependent on an increase in the participation of women in the labour market .
We must end it both within and outside the institutions .
If you cannot see the role of the Commission as a body that can transc@@ end national politics and parties in a way that will give a lead to the hope expressed in the World Social Forum , then we are wasting our time here .
Madam President , what we have heard in this debate is the usual confusion between cooperation and integration .
I think this will address many of the issues of industrial development and the issue of location .
This should include a thorough analysis of the markets , including the advertising markets , and of the habits of the population , like the average time spent watching TV , distribution of the printed press and levels of literacy , etc .
We hear a lot about the Lisbon Process , but very little indeed about the Lisbon Treaty , which , as we all know , is in effect the failed Constitution .
Ste@@ fan Füle and I have started that work .
You are right , Mr Prime Minister , that we have now got to do some of our homework as well .
Another is that by changing the status of sectors , do we not distort the existing market ?
I hope that the Commission will respond positively to Mr Pex &apos; s call for the creation of an EU coastguard , and that the Irish Presidency of the Council will also heed that call , particularly since , in coming from an island , it will appreciate the value of such a body policing our high seas .
in writing . - British Conservatives do not wish to see British foreign policy sub@@ sum@@ ed by the EU .
That is why I welcome Commissioner Kinnock &apos; s statement that the Commission will monitor the transition in all its formats .
We are often tea@@ sed and criticised that we have no big idea .
He stood four@@ square for democracy : the people were entitled to have their views heard , but then , it would seem , ignored , as the people of France and Holland have been ignored .
This moment may indeed be a turning point in Greek fiscal history and economic development .
Finally , what impact , if any , would this have on guaranteeing on a Europe @-@ wide basis the car which may be bought in another state ?
On the point raised by Mrs Corbey , may I point out that all agreements are undertaken further to an assessment of the health of fish stocks .
In other countries that are not as pro@@ ficient as these , we have to go and see with our own eyes and touch with our own hands .
We report regularly on the situation in the annual progress reports .
If we are to develop a Europe in which our people have a share , we must give them a role in creating that Europe and sharing that Europe .
There are issues associated with the funding instruments for the education of children with a migrant background .
In conclusion it weakens our fight against poverty and weakens European integration .
This debate takes place against an extremely sombre background .
Member States are not authorised under EC law to propose or nominate their own nationals directly to the Board of Governors for the position of Vice @-@ President of the EIB , and to do so is a clear violation of the Statute of the European Investment Bank .
Na@@ tionally funded assistance to agriculture and forestry may be given following notification of a state aid scheme , and is subsequent to approval by the Commission .
Cl@@ ear strategies and plans need to be in place now if they are to have any effect .
This is why the information society for all is one of the Lisbon Strategy postu@@ lates for open and competitive markets .
Just five years ago , the EU set out to make itself a rival to the United States of America within ten years .
Besides , though I hoped for it , I did not dare to forecast progress on visa liberalisation five years ago .
I should add that this is an area to which the Commission is paying particular attention .
Not that we do so every week .
Mr President , on a point of order , I rise under Rule 166 , which says that the Member shall first specify to which rule he is referring .
Let us not kill the idea for the future , but concentrate at this stage on what can be the solution to achieve a consensus among Member States and can be done quickly and decisively .
This certainly did not do it a particular service in view of its own record on racism in its own country .
If this is true , it is not a statistic of which any country can be proud .
It would help the EU to act with greater unity and coherence on the world stage .
We are also working in the Commission .
But I would appeal to Member States to work closely with the Commission in helping to focus and target these actions to get better results .
I acknowledge our responsibility , as the Presidency , to do our level best to reach agreement .
I recognize it might be useful for instance for English pupils at long last to learn how , despite winning all the critical battles in the Hun@@ dred Y@@ ears War such as Ag@@ in@@ court and C@@ rec@@ y , somehow or other we managed to lose the war .
Ensuring adequate social cover for all women who work in agriculture is another indispensable factor in modern sustainable farming .
This is the way to create the kind of Europe which is truly relevant to our people and I hope that this is what will happen in the future .
If necessary , on the basis of the new report , the Commission will propose restrictions to currently authorised use patterns , in particular to ensure that intake by children is safe .
I have a weekly meeting with President Barroso .
The proposal envisages 2003 as a preparatory year , with some activities beginning to coincide with the academic year 2003 @-@ 2004 .
The list of examples is long and grim : an increased use of the death penalty and the occurrence of juvenile executions continue to be of grave concern ; ethnic and religious minorities continue to suffer from discrimination ; the status of women remains poor ; freedom of expression has been further curtailed ; and the closure of newspapers , intimidation and prosecution of journalists and the cla@@ mp@@ down on blo@@ ggers have all continued .
Something that would undoubtedly help Argentina is deeper integration of the Mercosur countries and the European Union is making an effort to accelerate its negotiations with Mercosur .
You have talked also about fac@@ toring in both the national dimension and the wider public debate .
Member of the Commission . - It is true that in some countries these copyright levies are really very high or the differences are striking .
They are the youth of today , on whom the future depends .
Firstly , I wish to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy for their cooperation in producing this report .
Mr President , our European Union exists because it is firmly based on strict adherence to our European principles and values .
In the matters referred to by the honourable Member , the Commission has been informed by OLAF that it is aware of on @-@ going cases in Germany and Greece but that , until now , OLAF &apos; s direct assistance in matters involving Si@@ em@@ ens in Germany and / or Greece in respect of structural funds has not been requested by the judicial authorities of either Member State .
Building a solid house is a long term investment .
The European Commission is a strong supporter of fiscal consolidation as a precondition for sustainable growth , but we are more than ever conscious of the sensitivity of the economic debate now being discussed as the &apos; relaunch versus austerity &apos; problem , and this was discussed even today in the College .
What are the European soldiers in the field going to think if the European Parliament condemns such an effective weapon in their fight against insurgency ?
As it happens , my judgement is that whilst the propaganda will not fall away and its deci@@ bel count will not go down , whilst those critical voices will maintain their shri@@ ll@@ ness in years to come , they are becoming less convincing and finding a weaker reception amongst many of the international comment@@ ariat who follow these negotiations in detail .
I do not believe it is helpful for any country to institution@@ alise minorities .
I welcome the decision of the Council to increase the safeguard clauses from two years to three years , although I am concerned by the wording which says that these could apply from day one of accession .
Moving this process forward is not an effort for one or two : it is an effort for everybody .
As a next step , it is our intention to develop a road map before the end of this year containing concrete actions with firm deadlines in order to start putting a European information security policy in place .
The consultants engaged to assist the Commission in setting the revised targets , RDC @-@ Environment and P@@ ira International , assumed a number of underlying principles which do not apply to some Member States , such as Greece , Portugal and Ireland .
I know that the Commissioner has a healthy scepticism of my interest in budget quotas , but the 15 % identified in his own programming guidelines should provide a firm bas@@ eline in the budget for non @-@ state actor participation - 85 % for governance seems not an unduly small amount .
In the long term we must aim to achieve the ultimate . This can only be achieved in cooperation with the industry .
We did not deny the plenary a discussion on it .
This is a very important report in terms of completing the internal market for motor vehicles .
I would inform colleagues that on this occasion it appears that New Labour coinci@@ des with O@@ ld Conserv@@ atis@@ m .
I would simply remark here that in trying to pe@@ g what is said in this report to previous pron@@ oun@@ cements from the Commission , we are not trying to hold to a ne@@ bul@@ ous and rather nervous definition , but rather to seek an indication from Commissioner Bangemann and his colleagues of when a proper and acceptable definition of universal service will come forward .
Had the UK come up with meaningful proposals then I believe this Chamber would have been a useful ally .
In this case , I think that the Commission should act .
The attitude of the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Gordon Brown , to this matter was described as if he were proposing marriage but putting off the event for five years and saying that there would be conditions but not saying what they would be .
Considering that you hear one side from the Commission about EPAs and then you hear a lot of criticism from NGOs about EPAs , it is very difficult to find out who is correct on this and who is really benefiting from it .
While some might say that no deal was better than a bad deal for developing countries , without the shield of the WTO - as you said , Commissioner - they will be left vulnerable to use and abuse in a unilateral scra@@ mble for trade domination .
Following the model of the Ber@@ gen Framework , setting up the EURO@@ P@@ ASS diplom@@ a and certificate supplements with the European credit transfer system will require a harmonised EQ@@ F level .
I am interested to hear the comments of the Commissioner and the Minister on this issue .
In summary : a Constitution , incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , legal status for the Union , a President , a Foreign Minister , the collapse of the second and third pillars , a common foreign security policy , the eventual framing of an EU defence policy , the requirement that both economic policies and taxation be harmonised and the establishment of a European public prosecutor .
If those &apos; limitrop@@ he &apos; tri@@ bes are not respected and their destiny remains marginal , we are all drawn into a sw@@ amp of neo @-@ colonialism inside the new Europe .
Fundamental research will be included in the R &amp; D programme , and that will increase the probability of achieving progress and success .
Our understanding is that such now is the level of discrimination - not only actual discrimination against the homo@@ genous Roma population but also infringements on their ability to move , i.e. infringements on the ability of long @-@ term @-@ resident Roma in particular countries to move freely in reality .
In December 2002 , the EU started a human rights dialogue with the Iranian authorities , with the participation of civil society representatives .
Ukraine now has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitments to free , fair and transparent elections as part of the European community of nations , where it truly belongs .
As my colleague , Marc Tarab@@ ella , put forward in his report , women &apos; s health and sexual rights are an equally important tool for women &apos; s socio @-@ economic empowerment as well .
First a summary of the responses to the consultation will be published on the Commission &apos; s website at the beginning of October .
The CFP has been an un@@ mitigated environmental disaster .
The whole point of trade is to swa@@ p on the back of differences .
. Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr van den Berg on an excellent and valuable report .
I am confident that our amendments have made the Commission proposal for the regulation better and that we have brought it closer to users .
Mr President , I will leave aside the most pertinent question this morning , and that is : how on earth are European taxpayers going to pay for all of the apparatus and secretariat that has been talked about and proposed in this House this morning ?
What is happening ?
Mr President , I recognise what the Commission is doing to prepare for the implementation of our programme to improve sanitation .
The fact that the very comprehensive report on transatlantic economic relations has the input of half a dozen committees of this Parliament , and that it would need at least the same number of Commissioners present to discuss all the issues that are covered in it , shows how deep and intri@@ cate the EU @-@ US economic relationship is .
Nearly ten years on from the very first EU communication on human rights , and with the establishment of the new service , I want to ensure our human rights policy is effective , innovative and targeted : the silver thread that runs through all of our external action and a gold standard for our foreign policy .
Yesterday one of our colleagues was named and asked to leave the Chamber . That action was not carried through .
The Royal Society in the UK emphasised that recently .
. As a member of Scotland &apos; s Party of Independence , the SNP , I congratulate the Irish Government for the exemplary manner in which it conducted its six @-@ month presidency .
My own view is that the accession of China to the WTO , whilst perhaps not quite as eye @-@ catching as a multilateral agreement , is just as important to the future global trade regime , and that a similarly political position might therefore be taken by both Parliament and the Commission .
I welcome the emphasis on promoting women &apos; s full integration into our labour markets and on fighting all forms of discrimination to ensure that everybody can acquire adequate social security and pension rights in particular .
We need to learn from this experience that the commitment needs to be full , well @-@ planned and consistent and not half @-@ hear@@ ted and under @-@ funded .
in writing . - On behalf of the British Labour Members I wish to explain the reasons why we voted as we did on this report .
Nonetheless , at the same time we must urge all states to continue to support the work of the International Criminal Tribun@@ als for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia .
The amount of discussion on designation in Ireland at present reinforces the importance of this action and I look forward to Ireland completing its designation very soon .
This report deals with the period July 2008 to December 2009 , just before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty .
The 290 million citizens within the existing 11 EMU countries have the right to know what the European Central Bank intends to do to maintain and enhance the value of the euro now and into the future .
Firstly , if there is genuine confusion about what is or is not before the House to vote on , we cannot possibly vote this afternoon ; and there is confusion .
If we do not rapidly change from our almost total dependence on fossil fuels , it will , as our peer review climate scientists repeatedly and with increasing urgency point out , do just that : cost the earth through global warming .
So I may not put a question to the President @-@ in @-@ Office ?
But the system , as Lord Inglewood has said , has to be attractive to industry and business otherwise it will simply be an ir@@ relevance .
They will strengthen the incentives to invest efficiently in new infrastructure by taking account of the investment risks , while ensuring that competition is not sti@@ fled .
We have to have patience to see the truth , to analyse properly and objectively , to design help , to prepare tailored projects , to invest money , to teach and to lead .
I would again make the point that a list of priorities longer than five is not a list of priorities at all .
Madam President , I would like to refer to the mechanism to assess corruption in the Member States - the mechanism that is provided for in the action plan .
As regards Mr V@@ isser &apos; s report , I have indicated before that the Commission cannot accept Parliament &apos; s amendments but we have taken note of the recommendations contained in the report .
It seems to me that it should be up to the President to ask the Council to give a reply .
L@@ ari@@ ve report ( A4 @-@ 0@@ 50@@ 3 / 98 )
N@@ in@@ ete@@ en soldiers who were trying to keep the peace were abducted and murdered .
Ultimately , I think we should be following the line of President Barroso .
Member of the Commission . - We all agree with that , of course .
I want to make it quite clear that the position of the Liberal Group is that we shall vote for the joint resolution and we shall not vote for any amendments .
In particular , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Wojciechowski , for his commitment to this cause .
Regulation No 9@@ 99 / 2001 on TSEs was finally agreed and entered into force on 1 July 2001 .
Beh@@ ind those principles there is also a very clear statement of priorities from Mr Viola .
It needs the Member States and the Prime Ministers at their summit in March , when they will look at this document , really to take advantage of that .
The next item is the debate on the Statement by the Vice @-@ President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the Situ@@ ation of Christians in the context of freedom of religion .
Secondly , I would like to mention Amendment No 5 which Mrs Dybkjær has already discussed briefly , that is , the use of be@@ es@@ wa@@ x as a preser@@ v@@ ative for surface treatment of pe@@ aches and pin@@ ea@@ p@@ ples .
At a late stage , the Czech President came with new conditions before he would sign .
Finally , with regard to the formation of a formal trade and gender desk within DG Trade , I must underline again that within the Commission DG RELEX leads on the monitoring of human rights in third countries .
I have been seriously lobbied by the British banks about Amendment No 17 , which they do not like because it tries to prevent people they do not know from paying in huge amounts of cash .
Access to documents regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to hold the EU governing bodies accountable , stimu@@ lates greater efficiency and enhances democracy .
I think this really is an innovation .
It is an island off the west coast of Europe .
To put it simply , we have the same person performing the task of Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero @-@ Waldner .
I would like to know if there is any indication that markets themselves are responding to what is an increasing number of single people perhaps just looking for &apos; the bless@@ ed peace of the single bed &apos; , to quote George Bernard Sha@@ w .
The European Union is the largest donor to multilateral debt relief .
The Government of the Prime Minister came in with a considerable majority .
I was appalled to learn this evening that a planned performance in Romania in April had been cancelled because of pressure from the Chinese Government .
There is no place for cherry @-@ picking .
Before we begin , I should like to say that I have exchanged views with President H@@ avel , and I can assure you that we could not have imagined something like this 25 years ago !
I would echo the concern that SMEs could fall victim , especially if they trade overseas , in which case these costs may well be more than they can bear .
Three thousand people have lost their lives .
Well , there is no press freedom , there is no free access for NGOs , and , while the UN inspec@@ tor on religious tolerance may have been allowed in , Turkmenistan has the longest queue of UN @-@ requested visits of any country in the world .
Regarding the state of play , the South African side has always been very much concerned about its neighbours .
Other Member States have enacted only a few amendments , and the number of changes made of course depends on several factors including the existing regulatory framework and also the internal organisation of Member States : in federal states , it is more complicated than for others .
I would like the Commissioner here tonight to confirm that this cooperation is working to the maximum and as well as he would wish .
I am going to be tough but fair with Member States regarding the national allocation plans and am very glad for the support for this approach that has been obvious from your contributions today .
President Obama has yet to deliver on his promise and to close Guantánamo - an area where EU Member States could and should have assisted him more .
We want a statement and an action plan .
Many people in the European Union are trying to tackle the issue of landfill sites situated near homes or the fact that incinerators are being planned in some countries , including my own to try to deal with the waste problem .
In order to address this issue , I am exploring the possibility of establishing a strict segregation of the production of fats and oils intended for feed and food purposes from the production of fats and oils for technical uses , and I am considering the possibility of legal requirements on reinforced controls on dioxins at different stages of the feed chains .
We must try to reduce the number of vehicles on our roads , but there is no guarantee that this directive would do that .
What kind of statements are these ?
The rapporteur highlights the weakness of the EU &apos; s policy towards the Burmese junta , a weakness that is tantamount to app@@ ea@@ sement .
Of course , what we were voting on was utter nonsense , because it does not address the problem of the three different parliaments : Strasbourg , Brussels and , of course , Luxembourg , which everybody forg@@ ets about .
I can assure you that I am listening to all stakeholders at this stage .
This is the only rule that can apply .
This is , frankly , nonsense .
It is clear that Greece will shortly join the existing 11 Member States who are participating in the economic and monetary union , and I wish to congratulate Greece on its economic recovery and wish it well in the future .
This is not the problem , the problem we are facing here is simply one of financial management .
But sadly , others in the College did not share that realisation and so , while there are good elements in this communication , as my colleagues have said , we do not think that at the moment , it forms the basis for that consensus .
In the light of this advice we will then decide the content of a proposal for a directive based on Article 141 .
So we should have voted also on Amendment 4 .
I would like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his very detailed answer .
Thank you for the invitation to speak and also for recognizing me as Pau@@ line Green .
Madam President , I thank the honourable Members of Parliament for their comments on this significant area which touches upon many important fac@@ ets over and above trade issues .
It is also saying that this is the way to encourage - and it is encouraging - a black market in these tickets .
I think that these two changes would slightly broaden the chance for parliamentary debate and exchange while not destroying the purpose of the working group which is , of course , to streamline and to vit@@ alise the proceedings of the Assembly .
Hugo Chávez got to where he is today partly because we have helped him through our foreign policy omissions and commissions .
Fair Trade has made enormous progress in getting labelled products onto supermarket shelves and into mainstream buying habits and practices .
The amendments proposed here are appropriate and necessary .
The Treaty also states that , without prejudice to its primary objective of price stability , the Eurosystem shall support the general economic policies in the Community .
We all hope that the energy star scheme is a success and we look forward to watching computers throughout Europe going to sleep at the correct time .
It is in the spirit of Amsterdam , Commissioner , that we are all addressing you today .
Moreover , agreement has also been reached to have a benchmark that 35 % of spending should be allocated in support of social infrastructure .
President of the European Commission . - Mr President , my answer is yes , but this also applies to candidate countries .
We must look at that particular aspect of legislation .
Currently , some 180 developing countries and dependent territories are granted GSP .
Very few people know the reality of the scale of poverty and unemployment in Wales .
We reached broad agreement on the establishment of a European Syst@@ em@@ ic Risk Board .
We must address those very real issues .
Rel@@ ying on industry @-@ led initiatives is quite insufficient , for such initiatives frequently serve vested interests .
The presidential elections on 9 September will be the next test of the democratic credentials of the country and we are in close touch with the OSCE @-@ ODIHR discussions over the desirability of an international election monitoring mission .
It is that that has bothered me throughout the most , and I hope that you will do your best , Commissioner , to make sure that those small and fragile communities are protected .
On internal decisions and the opening of the labour market , this is , of course , the right of Member States .
I am aware of what a terrible min@@ e@@ field this proposal is going to be .
Firstly , it is very important that the Commission comes forward with a robust cost @-@ optimal methodology for renovation .
Whilst I and my Group recognise that this has had a considerable effect on aviation &apos; s growth , other factors have also contributed .
As I indicated before , the Commission &apos; s financial management is only part of the overall management of Community funds .
We in the international community must tough@@ en our resolve against this tyran@@ ni@@ cal Mugabe regime .
But , also , the western Balkans and , of course , the negotiations with Turkey need to be considered .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I should like to inform you that I will be making use of all my time .
In this respect I welcome the proposal to increase the multiannual budget from EUR 200 million to EUR 300 million .
The current international financial liquidity crisis and the economic backdrop has allowed many to grow cautious of setting long @-@ term CO2 targets or of committing industry to achieving the necessary greenhouse gas reductions and thus driving Europe &apos; s economy forward towards the low @-@ carbon , sustainable economy which we so desperately need and which , I agree , will spar@@ k a third industrial revolution with exciting first @-@ mo@@ ver advantage for Europe in the whole area of new technologies .
A few minutes later , the ste@@ ward@@ ess returned .
I hope that this approach will meet your concerns .
Now we have to have a fool@@ proof method of measuring all the ingredients .
It is not a satisfactory way of working .
On the phasing @-@ out of the Agency , the Commission is committed to ensuring an efficient phasing @-@ out and at the same time a phasing @-@ in of the EU delegation &apos; s liaison office in order to deliver aid without disruption and in a cost @-@ effective manner .
Secondly , there is no discer@@ ni@@ ble link between those three vague priorities and the lengthy annexes containing legislative and non @-@ legislative proposals .
The question of the share that should be allocated to the Community budget is dependent on the solution that is found to the division of funds between the Member States .
I am impressed at the respect you have shown your people in acknowledging that they , like the Irish , would , if given a chance , probably reject the Treaty of Lisbon as well .
Mrs McKenna in her im@@ passion@@ ed speech a few moments ago said that we must ensure that asylum seekers and others are not treated as criminals .
Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating Commissioner Bangemann on being a champion of the information society that is so critically important for the future of Europe and our competitiveness .
Whilst this appears on the agenda as the Wynn report , it has only just become the Wynn report .
Hungary had a Green ...
We need that strategy ; we need that strategy because the European Union is also losing credibility at international level .
We want to see progress on patient mobility and cross @-@ border health .
State assistance to that end should be encouraged most strongly .
Total unemployment in the European Union in 1990 was 7.@@ 7 % ; in 2000 it was 8.@@ 4 % .
Let us all work together to ensure that the Cardiff Summit is the people &apos; s summit .
Even worse , hundreds of villages were cor@@ don@@ ed off by the Red Army .
A complete study of eu@@ trop@@ hi@@ cation and groundwater problems and vulnerable zones designation by Member States has already been achieved by the Commission .
On the other hand , could not the revenue from the sale of the 100 euro coins be transferred to the budget ?
This will again increase the democratic legitimacy of the important decisions to be taken on justice and home affairs issues .
I therefore welcome the steps taken by Council towards an integrated approach to asylum policy and look forward to further constructive proposals in this sensitive area .
I welcome the fact that we are building a worldwide alliance against terrorism , but I would argue very strongly that we also need to build a worldwide alliance against poverty , exploitation and oppression .
In that connection , I do not want to see us use the ideas about tourism - and certainly , as Mrs Torres Marques has said , it employs a lot of people - to call for centralis@@ ing measures , for new tax centralis@@ ing measures or for new measures that might engage regions directly instead of Member States .
It is surely indefensible for the Commission and the Council to continue with any idea of holding this meeting .
The German surveillance scheme on 18 @-@ 40 @-@ year @-@ old Muslim men in Germany was not efficient .
That has to be balanced against the possible consequences for the energy strategies and the energy industries of the European Union .
It did so in relation to Directive 2001 / 44 / EC , dealing with mutual assistance on the recovery of tax claims .
Is it not time that you understood the Rules ?
The Commission pursues this approach in the European platform for Roma inclusion and with its internal procedures .
And if the &apos; rotating Presidency &apos; steps back in to restore the balance , we end up with more bureaucracy , rather than less bureaucracy .
We were able to put a figure on the table - EUR 2.4 billion annually - between 2010 and 2012 .
If I am angry - and people like me are angry - over Iraq and now Lebanon , what sort of ammunition does it give to people intent on the in@@ doctr@@ ination of alien@@ ated young Muslims ?
You have mentioned the Peace @-@ building Commission - which is very important - and peace @-@ making , peace @-@ keeping and peace @-@ building .
Incidentally , it is not unusual to repeat referenda : that has been done previously on domestic issues , and in certain Member States you can come back several times on a domestic issue too , so let us be intellectu@@ ally honest about this whole procedure .
It is just the degree of damage that differs .
On balance , we believe it will damage rather than enhance Europe &apos; s economy and the position of its working artists .
I simply cannot accept that the existence of seven groups inside Parliament creates a particular problem of efficiency .
Northern Ireland relies greatly on the maintenance of a competitive and efficient port infrastructure .
Consequently , the Commission considers that all the preconditions listed in the road map are met , and on this basis we propose to grant the visa @-@ free regime .
We have provided continual follow @-@ up since then , with a successful outcome .
Although a larger budget than the € 9@@ 0@@ m en@@ visi@@ oned by the Commission would be welcome - as the Parliament has pointed out in its Report through its request for an increase in the budget to € 5@@ 00@@ m - the creation of this scheme will give children regular access to free fruit and its attendant health benefits , such as a lower chance of developing obesity , diabetes , and other serious diseases in later life .
I again congratulate the rapporteur and ask that we all vote for what was originally a cod and hake report - and make sure that we do have a cod and hake report .
It should remain our common objective to make the best use of it .
I am going to ask you , President Sarkozy : what kind of European Union do you want ?
The Socialist Group will support the approach to global MEDA funding .
in writing . - I congratulate Mr Karas .
I do not think we will be supporting that .
There are also important data protection provisions that consumers feel concerned about in terms of giving up their data and going online , which also come under his area .
We in this House should show a little more gratitude and a little less criticism .
Even today , the Commissioner lacks the authorisation to turn the work of the high @-@ level trade groups into a concrete deal .
So for heaven &apos; s sake , let us start listening to the fishermen as well as the scientists .
The topic is WikiLeaks and cyber security .
However we view , as a Parliament , the proposed attack on Saddam Hussein , we cannot look at it in isolation .
There is no point in Europe being tough if it just means production shifting to countries allowing a free @-@ for @-@ all on emissions .
While this report had some negative elements , such as its call for a delay of the Trade Defence Instrument Review and the un@@ precise nature of the language on liberalisation ( which has opened up the possibility that certain aspects of liberalisation may be negotiated upon which were controversial at the WTO level ) , I felt on balance it was a report to be supported .
It is understandable why the Member States do this .
On behalf of my group , I also want to record our support on the issue of returning tax revenues to the Palestinians .
Finally on structures : we have already done the training programme for new heads of delegations , and one session was about human rights .
To say that is a non @-@ economic cost is simply an odd kind of economics .
So while it is the nature of politics to focus on today &apos; s problems today , we must not be distracted from legislating now for the longer term , for the post @-@ 2012 scenario , on this most important of issues , or history will not judge us kindly .
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his report and for the excellent cooperation .
Products will not be stam@@ ped &apos; This is foreign - do not buy it &quot; !
That was true before the incidents in Japan and it remains true now .
Within this , it is very important that we maintain adequate levels of state funding for universities - something which I know in some Member States is becoming more and more of an issue .
I have been in contact with the Irish Minister responsible for language matters and I believe that it would be very difficult to sustain the same level of interest in the Bureau among Irish government circles , should the Bureau be forced to close its Dublin office .
This ageing population will have severe implications for a number of policy areas : social , employment , housing , education , training , health care and social support .
For example , we have to learn the lesson that inappropriate regulation can sometimes cause a problem , as the Community Investment Act in the United States did . It encouraged banks to lend to customers who were not credit@@ worthy .
I think it is pretty obvious , when you see reactions like that , there is not much accountability going on within the Economic and Social Committee .
There are as yet no firm conclusions , but one loophole has been exposed .
author . - Madam President , my group proposes to delete paragraphs 2 and 6 .
I should like to thank Members for their contributions .
Today &apos; s report seeks to agree a legal base for decentra@@ lized cooperation for the budget heading specifically created by Parliament as far back as 1992 .
The action plan also specifies intensified dialogue on all these issues and there should be a second summit next year within the Spanish Presidency .
In particular , it is not a member of the exchange rate mechanism tool , and some elements of its central bank legislation would have to be made compatible with euro area membership .
Pati@@ ent health and safety must be paramount , but it must not be an excuse to block the free movement of professionals .
If this were to be done as a project between the Member States , of course according to their choice , these kinds of peripheral , lesser @-@ known but exciting areas would be better marketed .
There are environmental problems in China , of course , and these should be addressed .
If the Commission and the Council claim these are favourable economic fundamentals I would like to see the statistics they are basing this on .
Accep@@ tance of this package in the vote tomorrow will enable a highly ambitious and innovative policy to come into force .
My goal is to achieve a new agreement with very ambitious safeguards for privacy and data protection .
I would recommend to colleagues that the change should be from positive to negative .
The status quo is no longer an option .
That is what came through my head@@ phones .
Any reform , however , must retain the principle of relative stability which will best serve the interests of fishermen and the marine environment alike .
If we do not vote the EUR 500 million , and EUR 200 million is the final figure that the Commission sett@@ les upon , Commissioner Patten has also said that should that funding be spent rapidly and efficiently , then the Commission would come back with a supplementary and amending budget .
Firstly , the improvement in skill levels will be useless unless it matches the needs of a labour market .
The positive outcome for the EU resolution at the Third Committee shows that the international community shares our concerns .
He , like myself , has been given the great problem of trying to deal with a highly technical report and trying to find a way through .
How is cross @-@ border police cooperation developing between the EU and its most important neighbour to the east , Ukraine , and what measures is the Commission planning to take to step up cooperation ?
Regarding trafficking in human beings , in the Thessaloniki agenda the EU also urges the countries of the region to act both domestically and regionally in line with the principles of the EU and proposals contained in the Brussels Declaration of September 2002 .
Indeed I believe that is what the Commissioner feels too .
He also killed a polic@@ eman .
I would like to start with Mrs Klamt &apos; s report .
The more of it that is spent at the rate of up to 50 % , the further the money goes and the greater the impact .
In terms of the issues about fundamental rights , we are deeply concerned that one of the issues which does not seem to have been resolved in the Council is the question of procedural safeguards .
I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to all the courageous colleagues still working in Gaza , to those from UN@@ W@@ RA and ICRC , with whom we are working and who receive a lot of our funding , but also to many others .
With regard to price and quota cuts , I am convinced that there is a future for sugar production within the European Union , but that it must be based on competitiveness .
We supported the Palestinian elections and we also , I have to say , respect the outcome .
Until we look seriously into this matter , nobody will think that anything we do in the human rights fields is credible .
There are aspects of social services which support the educational sector , forms of housing which serve a general public interest even if not expressly dealing with a deprived social sector etc . - a sectoral approach is not enough .
There are reports of head@@ aches , sleep disruption and a number of other effects , which are not referred to by the Commission .
The Commission is carefully studying the types of information that should be provided in addressing this problem .
It is an increasing problem .
If fishermen want to make their boats safer they are prevented from doing so because it is suggested by the Irish authorities and by the Commission that they are adding to the capacity . This is totally untrue .
The Don@@ ors &apos; Conference did not produce as satisfactory an outcome as we would have liked , and there are some concerns about whether the EPA can be fully agreed or worked upon as long as Haiti is not involved .
We need to be able to issue broader and more stringent recommendations to the Member States to take corrective measures .
Maybe we really have to wait for a solid legal background for data protection before we start using SIS II .
in writing . - We have supported this resolution based on the fact that the Commission proposes to mobilise the European Solidarity Fund in favour of Ireland on the basis of point 26 of the interinstitutional agreement ( IIA ) of 17 May 2006 .
There are still tens of millions of living victims of communist regimes , as well as their descend@@ ents .
A joint programme , U@@ NA@@ ID@@ S , was established a few years ago .
Since we are upgrading , we should also have more comfortable seats so that every passenger feels at home and comfortable in this bus .
Our methodology will be flexible .
So we all , whether we live in rural or urban areas , have a common interest in ensuring a successful conclusion to the World Trade talks .
It concerns electronic guidance , computer work@@ stations and directions to rooms .
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want , but we need to be careful about the approach we take , so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve .
If there are problems then , we and the Council must have the courage of our convictions to act effectively in those circumstances .
I listened carefully to Mr Van Orden &apos; s report on Bulgaria , having met with Me@@ gl@@ ena Kuneva last week to discuss the position .
So this is the overall picture , and I must just repeat that the Commission &apos; s attitude is that we must bring clarity to the financial issues and clearly share the burden , have clear responsibilities , clear obligations , and then we can also find better solutions to the infrastructure questions , but we cannot have any kind of reduction in the quality of education .
The criteria for inclusion on the EMAS register are very stringent .
But Member States should concentrate on structural reforms , particularly in their labour markets , as the way ahead .
The quality of the school environment and teaching are prerequisites to efficiency .
I ask this Parliament to support those amendments to ensure that we safeguard our fish stocks and fishing communities for the future .
In December 1997 the Agricultural Council adopted conclusions on the Commission &apos; s study on the impact of concessions to the Mediterranean countries .
Commissioner , if I am here at 11.@@ 00 p.m. and ask you questions , I hope you will answer my questions and not only answer people who have the same view as you on this .
The Commission further stresses the need to attract young people to choose these professions .
Jour@@ n@@ alists have the right to expose wrong@@ do@@ ings , human rights lawyers have the right enshrined in international law to represent people in courts .
Not only have they had no problems , but their health and well @-@ being have benefited .
It was not until 1996 that Taiwan had its first democratic presidential election .
I wish it were , as it would mean that I was in control .
In particular , a situation where , as a result of market design , allowance prices significantly exceeded the long @-@ run marginal cost of ab@@ atement within the EU and approached the penalty price would be unsustainable .
An@@ s@@ wer that and this process will be successful .
They can and will vote as they please and they have the right to vote &apos; no &apos; .
Mo@@ stly they were concerned with issues such as sex tourism and general abuse in countries all over the world .
Further attention now needs to be given to updating the 1989 Council recommendation on the subject to take account of the evidence from research that passive smoking is a preventable danger .
However , there are some governments who think that this can be achieved only if Russia becomes a full member of the WTO .
The case for the project is over@@ stated and I do not think it is financially credible .
This is a toxic mix and I ask you to look at the contrasts and contradictions in this area .
Will it then be suggested that we must produce much more carbon dioxide to try and offset the cooling ?
The LTTE has to be stopped .
Although the Commission is willing to consider some advancement in the final date from 1 January 2011 , the Commission does not favour Parliament &apos; s approach linked to possible prolongation .
The proposal that there should be a full @-@ time President of the European Council has the potential to undermine both the role of both the President of the Commission and the Foreign Minister .
Then your neighbour decides to tear up that international agreement and unilaterally declare that they are massively extending their share of the natural resource that your business depends upon .
One of the arguments that was always put against British membership of the European Union was that it would mean that we would be turning our backs on the Commonwealth and that Europe was an inward @-@ looking small club of rich nations that did not care about the rest of the world .
I wonder what affin@@ ity there is between the British Conservatives and the bulk of the PPE on this fundamental question .
We hope you will not be limited by dog@@ matic demands to cap the Union &apos; s budget at 1 % for the next decade .
Of course we will try to do that as quickly as possible , not as part of the campaign .
The practice of artificially increasing the weight of meat by the addition of protein and water - in some cases up to 40 % or 50 % water in the final product - in order to mislead the purchas@@ er is despicable .
I can only say how thankful I am that Britain has not joined the euro ...
I join my colleagues in supporting calls for Europe to make a real offer of financing to the developing world to help it fight climate change in order to break the deadlock in the current negotiations .
He could be here and his report could be voted then as anybody else &apos; s would be if it could not be dealt with earlier .
My view is that this annex should be drawn up in such a way that no further interpretation guideline would be needed .
This clearly expresses our joint concerns about the executions of women and , more rarely , men by the cruel and barbaric practice of stoning and about the sharp rise in the use of the death penalty in Iran over the past two years .
Mr President , I wish to thank Mr Gro@@ ote , and more particularly my colleague Ms Weisgerber , who acted as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
Mr President , let me do a rather unusual thing in the European Parliament and respond to the previous four speakers , not a thing that people often do .
The Palestinian Authority is currently preparing an operational plan which could then be a useful tool for identifying development activities , particularly in Gaza , that we could support .
Commissioner , I ask that you make sure that the EU representatives at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod will give recognition and support to the civil society organisations .
I suspect that you , President @-@ in @-@ Office , through your passionate commitment to the European cause , which I welcome , were unable to stand back and look objectively at the impact on your presidency of the week of 29 May 2005 .
Please think it over .
To sum up , it is the view of the Commission that the Solidarity Fund is already a very useful instrument but , of course , there is scope for improvement , and we shall continue our efforts to that end .
Therefore , we cannot be satisfied with the fact that an investigation into the beating of Mr Kozlo@@ v has produced no results in two years and now there is a new incident .
I am pleased to hear the Commissioner &quot; s assurances on codecision here today .
We are re@@ designing , and while there is good news about what is happening in the South , the importance of this re@@ design and re@@ thinking goes beyond the South .
We are not saying that the specialist committees should not be involved in this , nor that there should not be a dialogue .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , on behalf of the Commission and of Commissioner Barnier in particular , I will answer by saying that improving transparency in financial markets and ensuring that all relevant market actors are subject to appropriate levels of regulation are key aims of this Commission and of the G20 .
But helping farmers is not just about agricultural policy .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Mr President , I completely agree with all the other speakers that this is an excellent initiative and I am very pleased that the Committee on Culture and Education and Mrs Paliadeli are putting this forward .
In this context , I have already recommended to the Council to modify the proposed date of entry into force of the directive , in order to allow its application as quickly as possible after a positive decision is taken by the Council .
Can we in Europe work with China to try to perfect what is happening , to try to improve the situation rather than simply to dec@@ ry what China does or the shortcomings that China has ?
Both the Council and the Commission still claim that the massive - not ad hoc - collection and storage of PNR data is necessary and proportional in view of the fight against terrorism .
We have heard that it is the biggest killer , that 5 million people die a year , 95 % of them in poor countries .
As you know , one of the great successes of opening up markets in Europe in recent years has been the airline industry .
We are going to weaken you in front of the Member States &apos; .
It has been technically feasible for more than a year and the Americans have simply refused to do it .
I am satisfied that the new part III of the IIA on sound financial management is , and will be , effectively and fully implemented .
We must try to make the effort .
Therefore , we have to accept the Commission &apos; s recommendations that we should proceed with five countries in addition to Cyprus .
The fact is that the Internet now provides new routes for these crimes , and I therefore think it is incumbent on us to urge that the acts of using the Internet for child pornography and for gro@@ oming children be made a criminal offence .
It affects 14 million women across Europe .
There are always choices to be made by different countries and negotiators as to what form of negotiation they prioritise - the multilateral or the bilateral .
I would say to both of them that the biggest threat to all markets will be if we get overtaken by pollution .
They picked up 48 offenders right across the EU - offenders in positions of trust ( teachers and s@@ cou@@ t@@ masters , a foster parent in Germany and a Swedish army ser@@ geant ) ; babies as young as three months had been an@@ ally raped .
Despite these reservations , I hope the general thrust of the report will receive strong support from Parliament .
Finally , I believe that the Commission should do far more to share its vision for the Galileo project and particularly the post @-@ development phase of the project and the on @-@ going situation .
U@@ pon recalling the last 15 months , for example , we have witnessed the tsunami disaster in Asia ; the strong tropical cyclone in Lou@@ isi@@ ana and M@@ iss@@ is@@ si@@ ppi ; the devastating floods in Romania , Bulgaria , Switzerland , Austria , Germany and France ; the serious drought in Spain and Portugal and the fires that have destroyed nearly 180 000 hectares of forest in Portugal .
Finally , I should like to come back to you on the results of the last Ecofin meeting , which invited the Commission to extend Annex K for two further years .
Nevertheless I believe in free trade .
We do not believe that it is business as usual .
In particular , I would like to refer to the obvious but important fact that support for regional economic integration amongst developing countries needs to be based on the realities facing developing countries in the individual regions in question .
The only certain aspect seems to be the consistent pre@@ diction that fusion will come good as a major source of renewable energy in 50 years time .
I look forward to the Commission taking this point on board .
The research also highlighted high levels of competition on and between Irish Sea routes .
What pressures can be applied , particularly to Mr Den@@ k@@ tas@@ h , to make a deal with Mr Cler@@ ides to enable a united Cyprus to join the Union in 2004 , as , I am sure , we would all wish in this House ?
Sadly all they see is their land and their homes blown to pieces by the tanks and planes our governments supply to the Ethiopian and Eritre@@ an politicians .
This is a crime against humanity of such a scale that it can never be forgiven and we must invoke justice and the rule of law .
This is something we want to do .
The site has a paragraph called &apos; positive aspects of ACTA &apos; , but there are also some questions that might be labelled otherwise .
I would like to make one more remark about liberalisation and public services : these are two different things .
I also hope there will be continued support for our stability instrument to enable us to make real progress in crisis response and coherence .
This means that fully harmonised rules will be in place from 1 January 2012 .
The buildings do not belong to a propaganda ministry ; this is a parliament .
It is my argument - and indeed that was expressed in my report and supported by colleagues - that if the appraisal and development system works properly there are no obstacles to achieving the linear career structure - and that is the whole thrust of what you are trying to do .
There is huge scope for savings on energy costs .
When you consider that there are people living in complete deprivation in some of the new Member States , like Romania , and many of these people , by the way , are subsis@@ tence farmers , they are the people who the poorest .
The ECB , as the guardian of the single currency , will continue to pursue its stability @-@ oriented monetary policy in order to fulfil its mandate and to deliver the policy results that European citizens rightly expect .
Father L@@ y has called publicly for the United States not to ratify its bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam , linking this action to human rights issues .
I hope this will be extended to all Central Asian countries .
Of course we look at the current developments in inflation also as one of the indicators of what we think is going to happen in the future , but it is certainly not true that we only look at the current inflation rate , as implied in the draft resolution .
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people &apos; s non @-@ disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision @-@ making .
I agree with the rapporteur that this interim report is something of a distraction , but an important one just the same , because it will awa@@ ken Members of this House to the importance of detail .
The Israeli authorities must seek to show restraint in response to these awful attacks and the Palestinian leaders too must press forward with their efforts to put an end to such atrocities .
A total of two ministers out of a government of fifty @-@ six ministers does not make the government Islamist .
However , we also know that , even if we are don@@ ating a lot of humanitarian aid , in the end we also have to find a political solution .
I would like to draw your attention to a specific situation in Nicaragua .
Let us also champion it for freedom and rights for people , including British people .
The Commission has a good record on this matter .
Before concluding on this point , I would like to underline that the work on the Stability Pact is not simply about being punitive to Member States or about recti@@ fying past mistakes .
In addition , this funding has specifically covered support for ampu@@ tees and refugees and internally displaced populations .
I hope you will support ours .
We also agreed a new partnership with India .
Mr President , there is no military solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people .
However , the significant increase in the level of arri@@ vals underlines the need for this policy to be strengthened and further developed .
We look forward to Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner - perhaps in a field that is not so familiar to her - giving us some comprehensive answers .
The path has been set and the objectives are well known , yet it is up to Serbia to walk down that path , fulfil the required criteria , and , once ready , engage in the negotiation process with the European Union .
It proved - if anybody needed further proof - that collectively and with strong leadership we can achieve an awful lot more than mere military might or economic wealth can bring to us , simply by the example that we give and the tactics that we employ .
Yes , the S@@ tran@@ ra@@ er @-@ Car@@ lis@@ le road is an absolute disgrace .
The great game of rugby league went metric years ago .
I welcome Parliament maintaining its position to exclude health services from the scope of the Services Directive .
As coordinator of the Socialist Group I should like to thank him for his help and advice over the time I have been coordinator , and for the quality of his work in committee .
I want to say a special thank you to Mr Gutiérrez Díaz for the commitment he has shown on this issue , both as a former chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , a Vice @-@ President of our Parliament and someone who has keenly followed these issues from the beginning of the peace process .
We will not and cannot tolerate this continuing .
Training doctors is a lengthy and expensive business , we are told .
I was astonished by his opening political statement .
For transparency in EU agencies to be improved , all 21 A@@ gencies and the Commission must publish a list of all contracts awarded over the last three years as well as a report of the staff members changing jobs from one agency to another , and they must enact stricter rules regarding conflicts of interest as soon as possible .
The first is democratic control . That means that the Council should not ignore and sid@@ eline the European Parliament , but should take its recommendations on board , even if it is not yet obliged to .
France has recently introduced a ban on beef on the bone and many French provinces have stopped school children from consuming home @-@ grown beef .
in writing . - The British Conservative delegation has traditionally given a free vote to all its Members on the issue of the death penalty .
As I said , we need to support Mediterranean food , and it is a very good idea for culture and diversity .
How is it that we maintain this relationship with one side , while that party ignores our interests and treats our words with such contempt ? &apos;
The real audience are our citizens and the countries of the European Union need to bring governments closer to the citizens .
I do not know whether you have seen the letter we received this week from the European Sustainable Use specialist group .
The truth is - and we have to face up to this , and you , Commissioner , have to face up to this - there were tonnes of pigmeat that were un@@ trac@@ eable .
It already produces the largest amount of electricity , but , as we switch to and develop alternative and new technologies , we will need base @-@ load electricity to keep the lights on and , for example , to power electric vehicles .
Apart from that I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the declared aim of the policy , namely to liberalise the electricity sector , is entirely shared by the Commission .
What steps does the Council propose to take during its Presidency to support informal carers throughout the EU , many of whom already provide long @-@ term care and indeed save our health services millions of euros in healthcare provision ?
I am pleased to say that we have the multiple @-@ entry visas .
In this regard I would like to quote N@@ out Wel@@ link , the President of the Dutch national bank , who published his annual report a few days ago .
The whole idea therefore origin@@ ates from the Council .
You know what is needed - to encourage investment , attract capital and bol@@ dly cut bureaucratic expenses .
She may have misunderstood what I said earlier , or I may not have expressed myself very well .
I am not saying that people who live in cities should get a better service than people in rural areas .
This is possibly our last opportunity to rally behind Nabucco .
Member of the Commission . - I definitely think that European farmers can be proud of their standards and the Commission favours any initiative that helps farmers , not least in the livestock sector , to communicate with consumers about the origin of products .
A single scheme has advantages for business : for example , only one registration fee and inspection , standardised packaging , and advantages for consumers who will not be confused by a ple@@ thor@@ a of labels .
In particular , the European Council endorsed the Commission &quot; s proposal for a fundamental review of the single market and the programme on sustainable development .
I hope the Commission will build upon this goodwill and not dissi@@ pa@@ te it .
The disciplinary procedure as it has been conducted has been undertaken in scrupulous observance of the rules and with scrupulous defence of Mrs Andreasen &apos; s rights of natural justice .
Thus they will provide greater financial diversity while keeping the original concept , namely risk diversification with the highest standards of investor protection .
These are the order of the day and this is what our people have to face .
Then appropriate decisions can be made in the light of that situation .
Fourthly , although the cow &apos; s milk collected this year is slightly higher than last year , it does not fully meet the increase in demand .
Furthermore , when the channels of communication between the services of the Commission and the national authorities , are improved they will be better placed to trace breaches of Community law at as early a stage as possible and to call a halt to them .
In it you reflected the seriousness of the challenge that we face , as the Roma are now the biggest homo@@ gene@@ ous minority in the enlarged European Union .
in writing . - Given that late payment is a phenomenon with numerous and interlinked causes , it can only be comb@@ ated with a wide range of complementary measures .
The UN has now announced a review of the IPCC &apos; s do@@ dg@@ y dossiers and fi@@ ddled statistics .
To explain why I feel so strongly about biofuel policy , what we have in transport is : firstly , more efficient cars - and in this House there have been some very tough debates on cars ; secondly , there is modal shift , but people still prefer in a lot of cases to use the car ; and the third is replacement with alternative fuels - one of the alternative fuels is biofuel , but we should take into account that it is produced on the land that could also produce food products , so that is why I believe that although this measure is positive - and it is very clearly positive - all the necessary precautions need to be taken .
How can they do that and the NGOs do that if the way we work and who does what within all of the different units remains a well @-@ kept secret , open only to those lobbyists and those lawyers who know ?
There are many things which must be done and I think that , during this Commission &apos; s term in office , we can move this forward a little .
We do not have a network of toll roads , nor do we lay additional charges on heavy goods vehicles after road tax .
This report states that the main goal of the directive is to remove obstacles to information , consultation and communication with the workforce to enable dialogue to take place .
There are also financial , legal and trade implications for the various stakeholders involved , whilst the lack of medicines may have negative effects on rural economies and agriculture generally .
We have been told by two of our own senior people that they do not have the right to pursue such issues .
It is all too rare that we get a very specific response from Commissioners to questions in an oral question .
So on this note of agreement across the House about the nature of this legislation and the positive direction in which Europe is going when it comes to water quality , let us also look to the Commission to say , &apos; You have the powers to investigate , to act and to enforce - please use them &apos; .
