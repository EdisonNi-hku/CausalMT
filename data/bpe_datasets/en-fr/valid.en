Last week , I led an official European Parliament delegation to the occupied Palestinian territories where , once again , I saw with my own eyes the apartheid system being implemented by Israel against Palestinians , along with the dispos@@ session and destruction of their homes , their lands , their water and their places of worship .
The third key message in the Annual Growth Survey is to front@@ load and speed up measures that are growth enhancing .
Mr President , I think what Mrs Palacio says depends on the vote that we are about to have on the second part of this text .
Both provide very important commitments to the way forward .
The rapporteur lists many sectors where improvements can be made : by public authorities , industry , business and individual consumers .
Mr President , my group attaches the highest priority to this report and to the work done by our colleague Mr Rothley .
If voting against this report has an effect on them , that is unfortunate and is not something that we would wish to see .
in writing . - The ECR Group strongly believes that in the 21st century , it is simply abominable that slavery still exists on our Contin@@ ent , and believes that people @-@ trafficking will only be comb@@ ated if all nations work together at the highest levels to prevent it .
We should remember that by concentrating on the problem that is there .
The creation of a European area of freedom , security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialised agency under the sole control of national governments .
The European Union very much welcomes that agreement .
Mr President , I should like to begin with the disturbing problem of the lack of consensus which has re @-@ emerged on the question of fiscal policy at the heart of the EMU debate .
Concerning the possible substance of dialogue , there is also a fundamental question to be answered : Should the participants also ask about their respective religions and the@@ ological approaches , or would this be dangerous ?
I agree with the aims of this report .
In the offshore sector , Amendment No 6 - we have looked long and hard to try to come up with a formulation that will make sure that we get a collective agreement leading to the maximum flexibility available under the directive , that is annu@@ alisation of working time .
I understand Mr Lehne &apos; s desire to get the thing taken into conciliation and further clarified .
We hope this will set a precedent for many of the other Islamic countries who do not feel , due to the type of legislation they have - Sharia law - that they can sign the 1980 Convention .
The Council will also discuss positive action , including the support the EU can offer to the recently approved extension of the African Union &apos; s mission in Darfur .
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf asked me about compensation .
Is the EU position to support this ?
But the proposals put forward by both the Commission and the rapporteur make far too little distinction between the most environmentally harmful and the better classes - from Euro , Euro 0 , Euro I to Euro II - providing absolutely no incentive to change to an improved version .
This is the difficult situation we are in at the moment .
I will not go into the detail because the points have been raised by the two previous speakers .
In August , Europe kept the tanks out of Tbil@@ isi .
It is not a product for sale .
It has also destroyed what the Palestinian National Authority has established over 15 years .
We have got to make it easier for the public to dispose of their electrical goods , and particularly small electrical goods .
Lin@@ gu@@ istic diversity is a pillar of this proposal and the main education and culture programme .
On patients &apos; rights to quality and safe health care , many of you have confirmed the fundamental importance of securing clarity and assurances .
We must have the full separation of transmission from other parts of the energy network .
You can also improve and add to openness and transparency .
Ireland is a nuclear @-@ free country and must remain so .
If nothing is done about the poverty and discrimination , these clashes will continue .
Madam President , I know you , like me , will share the concern that this week offers no opportunity to express our interest at what is occurring in Burma and , in particular , the sacrifice and suffering of Aung San Suu Kyi who is our Sakharov Prize winner .
Time and time again I have heard Members here talk of CO2 as a pollu@@ tant .
Mr President , we face many myths and red her@@ rings as we try to promote the debate on the EU Constitution .
People with relatives and friends on the other side want to help .
Even before the event , orders are being cut down and people are being put out of jobs .
The clear focus of our action on fighting poverty as part of our overhaul of the policy framework and concentration on a limited number of sectors will be key elements in improving the impact of our cooperation .
This new feature , familiar in many national parliaments , merely reflects information which is in any case published in detail in the &apos; Res@@ ul@@ ts of V@@ otes &apos; annex to the Minutes of the proceedings .
On the positive side , compared with the old extradition process , the time delay has reduced dramatically .
The other issue is access to confidential documents .
Mr President , I would like to give the following explanation of the vote that I cast in the debate concerning additionality .
We all seem to be quite s@@ mu@@ g about this and seem to be wanting to sit back and say what a good job we have done , but we must not be too complacent .
My congratulations to the rapporteurs and to the Commission .
Finally , there should be comprehensive national lists of registered private clini@@ cs and trained plastic sur@@ geons .
We know that imports into the Community have tariff concessions which have been agreed by the Council of Ministers .
That is not to forgive the atrocities that were committed or to say that the wrongs did not take place ; it is to say that you cannot go on living in the past , you cannot remain bitter .
Even if some of you heard this during the plenary debate on the question of the financing of FP7 two weeks ago , the context is clear .
Mr Pasty questioned whether there could be a conditional discharge .
We need clarification , we need certainty , and we need protection for the consumer .
I am therefore fairly optimistic that the vote due to take place later this week will preserve our chances of closing this file in a way that is satisfactory to all three institutions , indeed , in my view quite a number of amendments are already incorporated in one form or another in the common positions .
Many of us in this House know as well as anyone that getting a visa can be a time @-@ consuming and expensive business .
On renewable energy , I am very grateful for the support of this House for the recovery plan , and I am quite positive regarding what I have heard about the applications for offshore wind energy .
The rest of the world will follow what the EU @-@ 25 does at the Conference of the Parties .
It was supported by 95 % of the elected representatives in the Irish Parliament .
It is damaging through its stri@@ dency .
We welcome that but it is not good enough that it is based on unanimity . It must be based on qualified majority voting and co @-@ decision with this House .
We are closely monitoring developments in Guinea @-@ Bissau and are aware of the tremendous difficulties faced by the civilian population .
This is what I ask the European Parliament to take on as a duty : monitor the working of this treaty .
Sadly , one of the characteristics which does seem to be common in these projects is the tendency for them to drag on without recourse to re@@ assessment if Member States do not provide the where@@ with@@ al to implement them .
The full extent of the EUROPOL convention cannot be enforced unless this procedure is completed and it is a poor example to the applicant states if we ourselves cannot complete the ratification process .
It is they who will deliver the positive news from our institution .
To those sceptics who , in spite of all these accompl@@ ish@@ ments , continue to question the state of transatlantic relationships or my country &apos; s attitude toward a United Europe , my answer is this : even if the United States and the nations all of you represent were not united by shared values and common heritage of many millions of our citizens , myself included , our global interests alone would inex@@ ora@@ bly bind us together .
She said you cannot expect her to condemn human rights abuses in other parts of the world and let the United Nations itself be responsible for what is happening in Iraq following the sanctions .
These included my own constituency of London , yet I live in a part of London which ranks among some of the poorest areas in Western Europe in terms of child poverty and so on .
The new Commission is heading in the right direction and we hope that we will see an end to these kinds of reports .
The Commission will present a communication on conflict prevention this spring .
The process is used to retain a large quantity of water , up to 40 % or indeed , even as high as 50 % .
To conclude , I can only repeat that in my view , going through the conciliation procedure would not help us reach a better compromise than the one you have on the table today .
What is true , of course , is that Parliament &apos; s view - consistently taken - is a source of great strength , so far as the Commission is concerned .
Perhaps we could come back to this at a later stage .
Commissioner Ci@@ olo@@ ş has outlined our position on this , but let me state very clearly that the clearance of accounts procedure is an administrative one .
in writing . - I supported this resolution as trafficking in human beings is a modern form of slavery , a serious crime and a severe violation of fundamental human rights .
The consequences of this will be devastating . It will mean goodbye Council of Europe , goodbye Partnership for Peace , fa@@ re@@ well Tacis and a warm welcome to a new arms race .
EU action , as well as international commitment , is necessary for the protection of human health and the environment .
It also prescri@@ bes sanctions and appropriate remedies in the event of breaches and establishes enforcement mechanisms to make them effective .
This is another interesting story .
This is legislation which we are simply executing concerning the way we implement on our standards .
You must stick to that .
I do not know whether it is symbolic , but it is blank !
I welcome the establishment of a think @-@ tank to provide guidelines to the Commission on the social , cultural and political context as regards the selection of projects and complementary actions which will aid the Daphne II programme significantly .
It is only right and proper where there is a system of wholesale freedom of movement of persons and cross @-@ border traffic that a streamlined and structured procedure is in operation so that recourse is available to injured parties in the case of accidents .
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for that very insi@@ ghtful analysis of what has been going on .
It is immoral - immoral ! - to ask ordinary taxpayers of any country to pick up the ta@@ b for failed politicians and failed banks .
Mr Takkula &apos; s report rightly calls upon us to commemorate the victims of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes .
If , after long and difficult negotiations , we achieve a situation where the rule of law genuinely prevails in Turkey , and where European democracy meets a predominantly Muslim population , then that would certainly be an asset for Europe and a very important crossroads of civilisations .
I hope that the convention set up by Laeken will look at invoking Article 42 of the T@@ EU to bring these policy areas fully within the core competences of the Union .
Therefore , I welcome the new agreement to supply further food aid of something over ECU 30@@ m and to target children under 12 and lac@@ ta@@ ting mothers .
Just a few years ago the debate on ESDP revol@@ ved around the location and staffing of a small planning cell in a su@@ bur@@ b of Brussels .
However , it would be good to have the decision on the budget under the British Presidency .
The common fisheries policy is a bit of a mess at the moment .
We have looked very carefully at that third point . The Commission finds that there is not sufficient evidence to justify a finding that there would be damage which would justify not intervening , even though the initial dumping case , both with regard to the fact of dumping and its injury appears to have been established .
We published 14 days ago the so @-@ called waste report .
That is as an answer to those who say that , if we bring down the cost of roaming , national prices go up .
They will make the EU more complicated and further removed from ordinary people .
By completing the single European market it will give Europe &apos; s consumers more choice of goods and services , of higher quality and at lower prices and will , therefore , spur greater increases in living standards .
We should ask ourselves would we want to be receiving an injection from a doctor at the end of an 18 @-@ hour working day , which is not unusual .
We must look at that very closely .
The European Coal and Steel Community has served energy well and the Euratom Treaty , although anachron@@ istic and definitely a 1957 Treaty , has been a very powerful impetus to one form of energy - nuclear energy .
When we set out the Fourth Framework , the Third Framework , the Second Framework , the First Framework , society was poorer than it is now .
I am looking forward to working with you to conclude them as soon as possible .
For years , we have talked about the need to unlock , to mobilise , the development potential of all European regions and cities .
I do not think that anybody is ignorant of the fact that this is one of our major priorities , has been from the very beginning , and will continue to be one of our most important priorities .
Otherwise , Cambodia risks being bra@@ ck@@ eted with the pari@@ ah state Burma in the eyes of the international community .
As far as the free movement of capital is concerned they may be justified on the basis of requisite measures in the field of taxation , prudential supervision , or the use of declaration procedures , or by considerations in relation to public policy or public security - Article 58 .
Thanks to the rapporteur &quot; s open , transparent and inclusive approach , the report does just that .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , today and tomorrow are one of those very rare occasions when politicians can write history .
These included the ban on meat and bone meal and the testing of all animals over 30 months destined for the food chain .
The crisis of confidence has provoked a fall in asset prices , compou@@ n@@ ding the strain on banks &apos; balance sheets .
For this reason , and with reservations as above , I have voted against the report .
It is deplorable that the Council has not seen fit to designate Hizbollah as a terrorist organisation .
So I would call on the Commission to prioritise that view of the future restrictions so that we can further clean up this very important waste stream , which still creates so many problems for human health and the environment .
It may well be that , whatever draconian measures we take , we will fail to re @-@ establish the cod .
I have said to Mr Gollnisch that he can have the floor the next time the President is in the Chair .
Madam President , I want to refer to your expression of sympathy with the people of France who are affected by severe flooding .
Member of the Commission . I would like to inform honourable Members that on 8 September 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal to adapt the minimum rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages to take account of inflation since 1993 , when the current rates were established .
The rapporteur &apos; s proposal that there should be very clear definitions as to when such products should be allowed for use , should be supported .
The citizens &apos; initiative is like a new@@ born baby .
I also have a positive attitude towards this .
It is totally unacceptable that 78 million people in Europe are currently living at risk of poverty .
The Commission further encourages people to use the possibility of HIV testing and reiterates to Member States the need to establish testing centres that meet international standards and operate according to agreed principles .
Unless the security situation is secured , we are putting money from the poorest people in the world into an area which is quite rich .
I ask for the indulgence of the House for the re@@ arrangement of my group &apos; s speaking list .
I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes .
Many of us are anxious that experience should not be squ@@ an@@ dered or put on one side , but should be built on .
If military equipment is increased in accordance with what Plan Colombia is proposing , it will clearly reach the paramilitaries .
So when we return to discussion of Chechnya , we should continue to make clear our support for a political solution to the conflict , which fully respects Russia &apos; s territorial integrity .
There are other amendments we cannot accept because they go beyond the scope of the Commission &apos; s proposed changes , but in some cases , such amendments nevertheless point to important issues that may well be addressed in another context .
Sinn Féin will support any measures which contribute to the support of such islands .
Amendments Nos 3 , 4 and 5 reduce the scope of the waiver .
You have also underlined that more attention needs to be given to the role of the UN in this area .
The eurozone is a po@@ le of stability , and it is important that its capacity to provide stability is further enhanced .
Finally , I would like to remind the Commission of the first command@@ ment , which is that the Commission should now take the initiative on the basis of this report .
Some Member States have already made efforts towards consolidation .
Obviously , once the Court has given its judgment the Commission is at the disposal of all parties to analyse the situation and possible solutions as required .
So we are quite pleased .
We need to look at that issue .
It is true that we have to complement the policy of the Member States , as is stated in Article 152 , but that does not mean that we do nothing .
It certainly does not reach the highest standards set by some of our Member States , but we are moving in the right direction , although of course it is still not perfect .
I should like to welcome the President @-@ in @-@ Office to this other place and ask him if he shares my concern that the informal Council of Environment and Transport Ministers have indicated their desire to introduce a k@@ ero@@ sen@@ e tax which would have dramatic effects on air travel ?
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars .
There is a clear danger that the EU could be de@@ fl@@ ec@@ ted from its course if the public does not see concrete and swift reform being carried out on a significant scale .
In light of the amendment tabled by Mr Davies and myself at the end of last year to the common foreign and security policy report and adopted by Parliament , calling on the EU to act as an honest broker between India and Pakistan over the dispute in Kashmir , could we have a Council declaration or an oral question on this matter at the next part @-@ session ?
I am very happy to hear him say that cooperation with the national courts of auditors has improved .
See@@ king to include barometers ep@@ it@@ om@@ ises in a way the fan@@ atical and irrational dogma that all too often drives and brings ridicule to otherwise sensible Commission proposals .
Mr President , my group welcomed the report by Mr Papayannakis and salu@@ tes him for his persistence .
They also find that their intellectual property rights are still too poorly protected , and the general transparency of some markets is fairly low .
If we stop to think about it we could panic , but we must not .
Two weeks ago the European Parliament had a different composition from what it will have tomorrow .
The Commissioner claims India as his destination of choice - and of course I mean Commissioner Mandelson here - yet has fuelled EU obsession with China .
Though their opponents are still grasp@@ ing at stra@@ ws , it is clear from experience in America and elsewhere that the environment benefits .
On GMOs , nuclear and marine pollution : we can see that this is an area in which we would also like to be more ambitious .
In line with your suggestion , the Commission will involve consumer organisations representing traffic accident victims in the process of assessing the effectiveness of the systems existing in the Member States .
in writing . - I followed my group in voting in favour of this resolution , although our amendment on speeding up a review of type @-@ approval legislation was not adopted .
The second concerns police information which is intended to assist in the gathering of data relating to counterfeiting at both strategic and operational levels .
However , gru@@ bbing @-@ up allows those wine producers who are never going to be able to be competitive and who are not able to respond to consumer demand to leave with dignity and compensation .
When I started my insurance career a long time ago - practically 30 years ago - I remember the first week I was in the company , and the bo@@ ss told me : &apos; The big challenge facing us is that we are going to have to deal with competition from Europe ! &apos;
Once again we have an opportunity to help ensure work / life balance for Europe &apos; s citizens .
Parliament will take on an ever @-@ growing role in designing and driving such policy , in particular once the Lisbon Treaty enters into force .
This would involve much fuller participation in decision making by all those with a direct interest in each of the ICES divisions , whether engaged in fishing , fish processing , science or conservation .
I would remind you that the Commission has 27 veterinary inspectors for 15 Member States , to deal with all the legislation , third countries &apos; imports and so on . This is the reason why the Commission has been asking for a total of at least 200 veterinary inspectors and I am pleased to hear that apparently Parliament will permit the Commission 35 more inspectors by the end of the year .
On the continuous and possible increase of flows of refugees coming from the Libyan territory , the following actions will be considered : an adequate level of funds needs to remain available to support the provision of humanitarian assistance .
This is a view which I believe is shared by the vast majority of the Irish people .
It is important , when we make regulations , that we make sure that they are applied properly .
Would she not admit that this is actually true ?
I would like once again to thank Parliament for our many inspiring debates on this issue .
Dialogue by definition involves two parties .
Firstly , with regard to sustainable tourism , obviously tourism is best dealt with where you have human populations .
. Mr President , hundreds of thousands of European citizens fall ill every year as a result of entering contaminated bathing waters .
You need to draw a graph showing how CO2 perhaps causes warming .
These fair trial provisions are defined by all of Europe and are the rights of every European citizen .
Explo@@ iting the potential of mountainous areas is key to their sustainable development , not simply throwing more public money at them .
I would refer her to the comments of her colleague , the Austrian Foreign Minister , earlier on today in Parliament , when he said that job creation would be the top priority of the presidency and that under the Amsterdam Treaty the EU now had the necessary instruments available via national employment plans in specific and binding areas .
Po@@ stal services are performed by a necessary network of such people .
However , we must also recognise that it is still not enough : EUR 50 billion is not enough for a seven @-@ year programme for 27 countries .
I am very disappointed by that approach .
On the issue of scientific exchanges and visas , I would like to point out that these will also be covered by the FTA .
I think it has been a fruitful and constructive discussion , and thanks for all your contributions .
I believe it is time , under the new Lisbon Treaty , to look at having , on a rolling basis , a six @-@ month standby team including large and small Member States that will be able to deliver humanitarian aid where it is needed , on agreement between the institutions .
Over the past three years , the Commission has found it important to keep you involved in the implementation process and informed about our work with the Member States and , as was mentioned earlier , this will remain a key action to making the internal market work better , to deliver the growth and jobs we need .
The tobacco industry needs new recru@@ its to replace those whose consumption of the deadly product has caused their early deaths .
The Prime Minister of Macedonia wondered who would invest , build and hire new people in a country with constant shoo@@ tings , a country in one third of whose territory travel after dark is not recommended .
Unless we are seen to defend the char@@ ters and treaties which we have designed ourselves , such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and legislation on human rights , then we run the risk of becoming a laugh@@ ing stock within the international community .
I am pleased to be able to say that we expect the event to be well prepared , and we have already done a great deal of work .
On the issue of the claims made and the approvals mentioned by Mr Davies , I must state that , under Article 13 , we did have about 44 000 claims by Member States .
As we move into the next century let it be the first century in our island history in which we will have no killing on our streets and no emigration of our young people to other lands to earn a living .
Green Members of this House have argued that the package has been watered down .
The European Union has condemned the use of anti @-@ personnel landmines and we are supporting de @-@ mining operations through an international NGO .
Burma should be excluded .
That is really a prize worth having and worth having as quickly as possible .
I understand that a delegation will be sent to the second hearing on 25 April 2003 , and I hope that arguments will not be found to cancel that as well .
The Slovenian Presidency is aware of the fact that some Member States have still not been included in the Visa Wai@@ ver Programme , which enables visa @-@ free travel to the United States .
I would like to ask for a roll @-@ call vote on these two texts : the second part of paragraph 36 and paragraph 37 .

In this regard , I support Amendment 2 tabled by the Greens group , which calls for substantial reinforcement of the European Regulatory and Supervisory Framework in order to maintain financial stability .
Lab@@ els should be effective and strong , and at the same time the right incentives should be provided to producers to develop more efficient products .
I can only say at the moment that I am favourably disposed in that regard , but I need to study it further before I can give any commitment .
However , the rules in my view have not been effective .
Obviously , tourism and terrorism do not mix and as an area meant to be emerging for good from the dark shadow of terrorism , we in Northern Ireland are beginning , I am glad to say , to see a steady gain from increased tourism .
Despite that , unfortunately , our view has not changed .
The Commission views this amendment as a sign of support for the efforts it is already making , within the appropriate legal framework , to ensure proper application of the procedures for the granting of visas and to evaluate the adequacy of these measures , a matter it will subsequently report on to Parliament .
We already properly criminalise incitement to commit terrorism .
On the other hand , the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of the climate of confidence that appears indispensable , if a solution is to be reached .
. The Commission would like to recall that the public procurement directive applicable to public works was transposed into Greek law in the mid @-@ n@@ ine@@ ties and constitutes the appropriate framework for the award of public works contracts in Greece .
In Amendment No 99 , it is .
In my judgment , the only way this crisis can be resolved is through diplomacy , through expecting more of the DPRK , on this occasion in relation to nuclear promises in response to a greater commitment by the international community to welcome North Korea into the real world .
in writing . - Conservatives are fully in support of the principles of consultation and the engagement of employees in the running of successful enterprises .

She said the changes were those required by the British Government and they involved changes in names and symbols .
Of course , as you quite rightly say , excessive alcohol in pregnancy is a very serious matter .
All these pressures , often exacerbated by weak responses by governments and public bodies , are threatening our ability in Europe to realise the great potential which biotechnology offers us .
In fact , when we decided in 2003 to set up those relationships within the framework of a comprehensive strategic partnership , we were committing ourselves to an extremely ambitious enterprise , and this is very much reflected in the broad and wide @-@ ranging relationship which we have with China today .
Unfortunately , development of the implementing measure linked to the greenhouse gas intensity reduction target contained in the Fuel Quality Directive has taken longer than anticipated .
The EU has been following the rapidly unfolding events in the entire region very atten@@ tively , as confirmed by numerous high @-@ level meetings , formal statements and Council conclusions .
I agree with Mrs van den Burg that we need to take experience into account .
Refer@@ ences to the struggle against fascism fall particularly ill from the li@@ ps of a President , one of whose predecessors expressed condolences upon the death of Hitler .
If we want to keep the lights on , we need a nuclear renaissance , and it we need it fast .
If you want to conserve fuel , the way to do it is through fuel duty , not other forms of taxation .
However , I will look at ways and means to improve this communication and discussion process with the European Parliament .
I was in the Grand National Assembly last year when I heard a debate about the customs union . I heard Mr Er@@ ba@@ kan speak very forcibly against the customs union .
This in itself is a great success and worthy of support .
One of the changes or important phenomena , which one can see in the press conferences on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ days , is that there is the possibility of using all the official languages .
But time does not permit it and I shall simply content myself by thanking those who sent me here for doing so and saying that I will try and serve their interests as best I can .
Some of the European Union &apos; s neighbouring states are not considered developing countries and yet their epidemiological situations and possible solutions are similar in nature to those in the developing world .
Mr President , this directive underlines the seriousness of our intent to come to terms with greenhouse gases .
Madam President , like so many areas of activity , gambling has benefited from advanced technology .
Let us listen to sound scientific advice and trust in our own food safety system , which I believe is second to none .
Mr President , first of all I would like to pay tribute to all who served on the recent EU election observation mission to Pakistan , particularly the members of my core team and also the European Parliament delegation led by Miss Grö@@ n@@ fel@@ dt Ber@@ g@@ man .
Mr President , the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council may find it strange that I should be welcoming the Irish Republic &apos; s presidency today , but I know that he will understand my intention because he is going to be so busy over the next six months that we will not have to tolerate his presence at meetings in Northern Ireland .
We have all been impressed by your mach@@ o image , clearly learned from watching too many World W@@ res@@ tling Federation bou@@ ts .
We must go ahead with it and push it forward .
It may be important to the Greens not to be happy , because Greens are eternal campaigners , but they should take some account of what the Commission has said in that statement .
If two countries &apos; governments have accused each other of turning off the tap of the gas pipelines , then the only conclusion that I can draw - because I trust the countries and governments - is that somebody tam@@ pered with the pipelines , and that is very difficult to believe .
We also have a whole legal framework based on non @-@ discrimination , free movement of people and the enlargement strategy .
Furthermore , in these conclusions , Council agreed to urgently develop the strengthened medium- and long @-@ term measures relating inter alia to transparency regarding the physical flow of gas , demand and storage volumes , regional or bilateral solidarity arrangements , to address the issue of missing energy infrastructure interconnections ( which is a huge problem ) , to continue to diversify the transport route and sources , and to address the financing aspects of this , also by speeding up the revision of the Security of Gas Sup@@ ply Directive .
As the Vice @-@ President of this House responsible for transparency , I have not always found it an easy subject , but I do believe that now we have the chance to do better and to reach out even further to our citizens .
It is a financial assistance programme set up , together with the Irish Government , to restore domestic and external confidence and remove the harmful feedback lo@@ ops between the fiscal and financial crisis .
Mugabe did not like the result of an election and has since fixed it ; he now arrests parliamentarians to try and achieve a new balance , and does worse .
Everybody around the table shared the basic analysis .
That will be for another day as far as I am concerned .
I would like to say yet again that we have a fundamental need to examine discharge procedures .
I hope that the House will continue to give its support to this process of externalisation .
I welcome it because it takes an - albeit small - step towards completing that single market .
This package of European support covers contributions both from EU Member States and the EU itself .
These include Iran &quot; s nuclear and ball@@ istic missile programmes , its approach to terrorism and the Middle East peace process , and human rights .
A satisfactory outcome can only be achieved with the full cooperation and efficient administration of the individual governments of all Member States .
It was appalling - a community that exported gang@@ ster@@ ism .
With regard to intellectual property rights , the FTA contains ambitious commitments going beyond WTO rules .
It is a matter for Europe as a whole .
Perhaps we will not have this project ready before the elections and there is a risk perhaps that the Commission will withdraw the proposal .
Its capital requirements will make it difficult for private equity funds , and it is venture capital start @-@ ups that will suffer the consequences .
This is related to the fact that many people think that quantity is quality , namely , the bigger the spending , the better its impact on the European economy and society .
Mr Wurtz , I do not know who your interlocutors were in the UK , but I will give you some new ones when you come next time , if you do not mind !

Ten per cent of the world &apos; s biom@@ edi@@ cal research funds are dedicated to addressing the problems that are responsible for 90 % of the world &apos; s burden of disease ; that is the imbalance .
Madam President , as the economic crisis deep@@ ens , major issues leading to industrial action are emerging in the United Kingdom , flowing from the compul@@ sion for unrestricted free movement of labour within the EU and the procurement requirements in regard to major public contracts , whereby contracts won by foreign companies are resulting in a significant influx of foreign workers , putting local workers and local unemployed at a disadvantage and depriving them of opportunities .
The undertakings given by Mauritania have , in the Commission &quot; s opinion , addressed all the main problems that the country is facing .
We would find out how well the controls were working not only across the Union as a whole but between Member States .
We were brought into the transatlantic community several years before becoming members of the EU .
This is unacceptable - it is just shifting our problem to other parts of the world , and the marine environment has no borders so anything that happens in one area eventually comes back to roo@@ st here .
On Amendment No 12
I welcome this new Member ...
Mr President , the launch of the notes and coins has finally made the euro a political reality for the 300 million people of Euro@@ land .
I would ask the Commission to watch this space very carefully .
I have one particular difficulty with the Pirker report : it is far too optimistic , far too ambitious to think that we can , at this stage , harmonize or integrate in any way the drugs legislation in the Member States .
I trust that I have answered the questions satisfactorily .
With regard to agriculture and fishing , some of your recommendations are already part of our legislative proposals , as some of you must know .
In line with the cav@@ eats that I have already spelled out , you should anticipate important reservations on several points - as well as wholehearted agreement on others .
But we should not be somehow misled by this .
There is also a need for a new directive on disability rights which would guarantee that people who suffer from conditions of this kind are not discriminated against in accessing jobs .
With regard to the application of Community rules regarding occurrence reporting , the Commission is satisfied that all Member States have set up a mandatory reporting system and collect the information in national databases .
A clear and continued commitment to the full implementation of the Security Council resolutions relevant to Lebanon also remains essential , indeed crucial .
Indeed this gave us in the West of Scotland a particular problem .
Secondly , Council gave particular attention to complying with the annual expenditure ceiling set by the current Financial Perspective and to leaving adequate margins below the ceilings - where possible - so that there is some room to finance unforeseen events during 2006 .
The fact is that the Council did not will the resources , or the means , to the Court to do all this extra work .
I could have referred to the EU statement in the UN Commission on Human Rights as well .
In conclusion , we have just concluded a long referendum campaign in Ireland , with a successful outcome for the Nice Treaty , and one of the major issues throughout the campaign was the sense of power@@ lessness and distance .
I thank the rapporteur and others who have spoken for their words , because , after all , in a debate like this , you are speaking for women who cannot speak for themselves .
But it is also an industry which requires , as Mr Ó Neachtain said earlier , to adhere to the stric@@ test standards of compliance with best practice in the fields of the environment , welfare , health and food safety , particularly if consumer confidence in its products is to be increased .
We are right to recognize the opportunities and the Council &apos; s difficulties .
The dissemination of information about the range of marine pollution threats - hydrocarbons , radioactive substances and other harmful substances - will serve to ensure that the best possible mitigation measures are in place and have the full public trust and confidence of the public .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , let me first thank Mr Karas , Ms Bowles and others for raising these very important issues concerning the quality of statistical data and Eurostat .
It is also being expected to take on new responsibilities , not least in terms of health claims with regard to nutri@@ ent profiling and so on . We are not funding that adequately either .
So what happens to family life , despite the claims to humanitarian protection ?
I also believe in this sense that the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is a beautiful text which should be read by every child in the European schools and which should be worked on by every student in our universities , really makes the right point : there is no difference between men and women .
During the Lisbon Treaty debate in Ireland , people came up to me and said : &apos; you are urging us to vote &apos; yes &apos; and you are going to lose your job &apos; .
In Parliament &apos; s Committee on Industry , Energy and Research there was a huge majority in favour of this compromise .
The EU needs to engage with Libya across a broad range of issues .
For example , I have already accepted the setting up of a round table , which will bring together the relevant actors .
It would therefore have been inappropriate to introduce under this action plan another policy framework concerning corporate social responsibility .
I can fully understand why money must go into the reserve and I can fully understand why there is increasing concern about the way the agencies operate , but we need to give them the appropriate resources to do their job and that particularly applies in the case of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Therefore the Commission cannot agree to deleting the words &apos; chemical and thermal &apos; as proposed in Amendments Nos 1 and 2 .
It therefore supports the designation of 2005 as the UN International Year of Sport and P@@ hysi@@ cal Education and welcomes the efforts made to promote the use of sport as a tool for development .
It is one part of the process and we are definitely continuing to negotiate with the United States but I would like to underline that the United States is a very difficult partner .
We would not like to see a larger Health Fund board . That would not be efficient .
The Eco @-@ design Directive represents a big opportunity for industry to build more competitive businesses based on green technologies .
When we receive a petition about abducted children we immediately make contact with the petitioner .
The regime is coming apart at the sea@@ ms , and the Iranian people have coura@@ geously shown , since last June , that they do not trust and do not support this dece@@ it@@ ful and aggressive dictatorship .
I would just ask , because I was involved yesterday , that you bear in mind the most vulnerable when we are doing trade agreements and having conversations .
As you know , I am vice @-@ chairman of the J@@ PC with Slovenia .
Of course they have a bearing on competition and smuggling , as we all know , but why should this be illegal , as he maintains ?
Not one can be used to generate nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
Like Mrs Pack , I also noted the tense situation in the country over the summer and the parliamentary boycott by the opposition .
This is for the better@@ ment of the economy as a whole and of conditions in our areas .
The Commission takes note that Member States will provide yearly updates for some aggreg@@ ated data sets . These aggreg@@ ated data refer , for example , to some of the structural indicators requested for the annual spring report of the Commission , which was agreed at the Göteborg European Council of June 2001 .
We cannot ignore this fact .
It will avoid conflicts of jurisdiction and the unequal treatment of insurance creditors .
I appreciate that you also share that concern , judging from your resolution on Cambodia in March and the briefing Sam Rainsy , the Cambodian opposition leader , delivered to the public hearing here on 12 September .
Again , in relation to Equitable Life , it was very important for us not to promise more to people than we could actually deliver .
I draw colleagues &apos; attention in particular to paragraphs 24 and 25 , which call for a set of comprehensive guidelines for hotels that are sensitive to the needs of consumers .
. I cannot add very much .
Yes , the methodology of the Au@@ to / Oil Programme was innovative but it had two problems : firstly , it took a long time , so that recent worries about , for example , particu@@ lates were not covered ; secondly , the European Parliament was involved at a very late stage .
President @-@ in @-@ Office , in Ireland you caused something of a sti@@ r : you were reported in the media as saying that it is important not to launch some discussions that might cause problems in our country .
However , in seeking to achieve these goals he is calling for the suppression of minority views and is almost single @-@ han@@ de@@ dly destroying the principle of freedom of speech .
That is one thing we cannot do .
This was sold when he was not looking .
The time is right to step up with measures to prevent negative developments in the region and the escalation of tensions .
We have already reserved EUR 14 million for promotion for the rest of this year .
Important work is under way in that respect .
On Amendment 7 the multiannual framework is designed to regulate obligations on European Institutions and / or the Member States to monitor compliance with all international human rights conventions to which the Member States are party .
in writing . - I voted yes to these reports , as agreed also with the rapporteurs during our debates in the Committee on Civil Liberties .
The Commission has looked into a number of options for encouraging the development of risk crisis management tools and providing an improved response in the event of a crisis .
Since the East Timor referendum , up to 10 000 people have been slaughtered for voting for independence .
Today the CAP is not the biggest item of spending in the EU budget .
The fact remains that if the Republic of Ireland and border counties achieve Objective 1 status and Northern Ireland does not , that will be unacceptable .
I am sorry , I do understand frustration , but my thoughts were : have you gone mad ?
People consider that mass culling for disease @-@ control purposes should be performed in the most humane way possible .
One could say in its favour that unlike some of its neighbours it remains free of inter @-@ ethnic strife .
Therefore , we must give greater priority to bringing in and gaining the support of nations elsewhere , to getting emissions trading up and running , and to taking real action to reduce global warming gases in this Union .
Ap@@ propri@@ ate messages about the health effects of AIDS must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate .
That in itself is something of a simplification , because it is a lot more than that and , as the Commissioner himself just said , it brings together a very complex network of existing measures .
For example , rural development supports the funding of day @-@ care centres for children in the countryside so that women have the possibility to stay out there but still to take upon themselves the possibilities of a job .
On the very specific and important issue of shoes , let me say that on 30 August 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal to impose anti @-@ dumping duties on certain leather shoes from China and Vietnam .
Let us go forward and actually reform the agricultural policy .
The Council also shares Parliament &apos; s view on the need for a swift and effective implementation of the new Eurojust and Europol decisions .
From October 2005 - that is , two months before the launch of the sun@@ rise period - the registry published on its website and in all the official languages a detailed description of all technical and administrative measures concerning the registration procedures .
If you look at the density of vehicles we are up at 500 per 100 , 000 population and when you look at the countries that we are talking about in this report you need a ma@@ gni@@ fying glass to try and work out what the vehicle density is .
Refer@@ ring to it in bibli@@ cal terms does not help because it continues to put the various arguments into com@@ part@@ ments .
I know Members would wish to discuss the issue , even if not to decide on it .
International aviation is not yet covered by the Kyoto Protocol .
Vi@@ ews are deeply divided as to whether matters are improving or deteriorating in terms of meeting Copenhagen criteria .
This must be taken into account in considering the beneficial impact of ICT used .
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today &apos; s agenda .
Let us pass over the suspicious timing of the grant to Dell in Ireland that was announced with questionable procedural propri@@ ety in the run @-@ up to the Irish referendum on the European Constitution or Lisbon Treaty .
Those are the kind of important things that the European Union can do .
I understand that off @-@ road vehicles account for about 8@@ .5 % of the diesel vehicles in the European Union .
I thank Mrs Fourtou very much for supporting the N@@ E@@ RA study .
Mr President , that is wrong .
I call on colleagues from all political parties and groups to vote this report through unanimously .
This would certainly redress the population balance .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - Mr President , this debate has been extremely interesting , and it seems that we are very close to reaching a first @-@ reading agreement on the proposal in the area of applicable law .
The Commission can accept this compromise package , consisting of Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 22 , 23 and 29 up to and including 59 .
Obviously , the environment is the major area where complaints come to us from citizens of the European Union .
An information technology revolution is certainly upon us .
I am particularly concerned here as a woman and a public representative of a small country that up to 30 years ago had prohibi@@ tions on women &apos; s rights in many areas ; women were not even allowed to work once they got married .
Cyprus has one of the largest bone mar@@ row transplant banks in Europe .
Commissioner , if you ask them what sort of things they want us to do , they say &apos; the things that protect us , the things that help us &apos; .
Do not over@@ sell the result .
Now we can mobilise and coordinate the help and assistance of all Member States .
Many of the amendments are seeking to strike the correct balance between them .
I have to say that sometimes he gets it right and sometimes he gets it wrong ; he is wrong on this occasion .
Turkey is welcome to join our Union and I very much hope that it does , but it must accept and abide by our European principles and values .
The issue of Bulgarian and Romanian membership of the Union will also feature on the agenda and the objective there must be to affir@@ m the accession of both countries whilst recognising that a great amount of work remains to be done - in particular in the case of Romania - to ensure they remain on track .
I am looking forward to cooperating with the European Parliament .
The EU is a solution in search of a problem , but surely the day is coming when we can no longer impose ourselves both on the markets and on public opinion .
Mr Poettering &apos; s analysis , for example , was very interesting and he is quite correct that it is critically important to keep the momentum going .
As I said , what we wanted to create with the Euromed Partnership is exactly that : a partnership , which means both sides will have to do their utmost to get things moving and quite a lot of reforms are still necessary .
I do not want to see a delay to the implementation of these proposals over relatively minor issues .
I am glad that we have today sent the Commission home to think again , and hope that the Commission will now accept our view on this matter .
I stated this in Brussels and in Budapest when I had the honour to be received there by Prime Minister Orbán .
Org@@ an@@ ise the police forces so we can deal with the growth in crime . &quot;
Fishing is now a global industry . F@@ le@@ ets from the EU cover all the oceans of the world , as do those of several other distant water @-@ nations .
It gives a huge amount of information and I would like to congratulate them on that .
Finally , let me once again thank the Women &apos; s Rights Committee and Mrs Lulling for their work on this important issue .
We call on the government to ratify the International Criminal Court .
Nonetheless , there is much to be recommended in the Commission &apos; s proposals and there is a clear way forward for harmonising criminal sanctions by means of a third @-@ pillar instrument .
Madam President , most ordinary people see crises as tragedies .
We therefore propose that Member States can immediately grant temporary cessation aid as a lead @-@ in measure to restructuring and that they can then set up F@@ le@@ et Ad@@ ap@@ tation Schem@@ es under which limitations on access to permanent cessation - scrapping - premiums will be lifted .
However , it is rather complacent and patron@@ ising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high @-@ tech solutions , while China simply does the manufacturing .
At any rate not such ty@@ po@@ lo@@ gy has been conveyed to us by way of complaints , unlike in the case of DVD , which is the subject on which we are conducting the inquiry and to which your question is addressed .
One consists of support for the country &apos; s media and journalists and the other one relates to modernisation and edu@@ cating the police force , making it able to work as a police force should in a democracy .
I think that some people have a fairly naive understanding of democracy and the way things work .
She did try this morning to get the report voted as you know but many other of our colleagues walked out and would not stay on to vote .
That is the picture today .
With some 14 % of all public investment in met@@ ro@@ polit@@ an France represented in this programme , it demonstrates , beyond doubt , the value of the safety net , which we argued for in the next programming period , to avoid a sudden disappearance of this very significant level of support .
So thank you for your comment .
I too am pleased to see that certain amendments that were put forward by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - but not accepted by the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs - have been tabled by a variety of the political groups in the House .
So we are taking this issue into account as well .
We fear that many valuable projects will be lost .
There is huge potential in new green technologies such as solar thermal from the Sahara and wind farms from the North Sea , not to mention carbon capture and storage and basic improvements in energy efficiency , where - at least on that point - I agree with my Green colleague across the floor , but all of this requires massive investment , and that is the fundamental point about these questions today .
Until now , Member States have been ren@@ eg@@ ing on their pledge to reduce energy consumption by 20 % by 2020 , by making insufficient progress .
We are down to 38 Members present , and I am sure that some of those Members will have to leave within the next half hour , during the course of this debate .
It is time to move forward , away from the hurt and the anger which have bli@@ ghted Kosovo &quot; s politics for so long .
It considers that this proposal should be brought into line with Directive 1999 / 30 by inser@@ ting the words &apos; where there is more than one measurement station within the zone or agglom@@ eration at least one should be placed close to traffic and at least one should be oriented to the urban background &apos; .
What are the best conditions for carrying out elections ?
If I read between the lines of what he has said , and forgive me if I mis@@ interpreting him , I certainly got the impression from his reference to the compromised amendments that he was not speaking with great enthusiasm but was identifying the fact that this House was divided .
In this respect I am glad to see that the Commission supports the historical cost formula for pricing .
A number of questions could be clarified and debated and I hope to be able to take the important and useful suggestions into consideration during negotiations in the Council next week .
Obviously , the FTA also opens the EU market to Korean products .
From the perspective of power , the European Union and European integration are inexplicable , meaningless processes for Russia .
These incinerators have to adhere to higher standards than the co@@ incineration plants .
They do not have the tools and equipment .
After all , access to documentation is a fundamental civil right and no documentation is more important to a candidate than documentation in relation to examin@@ ations .
We said &apos; never again &quot; in 1994 after Rwanda , and what we face now is the first genocide of the 21st century , unless we end this complacency and do something .
The only reason why I did not go into detail with regard to the humanitarian situation was because I had already gone three minutes over my time .
We have heard a great deal .
I congratulate Mr Watson and all concerned in putting together this report .
However , it is relevant to note that in this case the master of the vessel and the Portuguese authorities did not oppose the prolonged stay of the Canadian inspectors on the vessel and the fishing activities of the Santa M@@ af@@ al@@ da were not obstruc@@ ted .
Mr President , I welcome this debate and report on social reality and , though we must of course welcome stocktaking and exchanges of best practice and the open method of coordination , the reality that we have to understand is that these devices have not yet stopped : women having 24 % less pay compared to men in Germany ; nearly one in three children living in poverty in Poland ; and wealth inequality in my own country , the United Kingdom , at a 40 @-@ year high .
We need to move from a pure administration aspect of staff matters to a more modern , strategic and forward @-@ looking staff management and also recognise that information technology has changed the way we work and look at our administration .
Secondly - and this appears in the Liberal Group &apos; s resolution and also in the compromise resolution - the anth@@ ra@@ x problem in the United States has drawn all our attention to the need to react quickly and to analyse what is happening .
Dep@@ ending on the vote on Wednesday , either I have taken up much too much of Parliament &apos; s time already in putting forward a point of view or we are at the start of something big .
Lastly , there is a current complaint with the Commission about the application of Irish planning law .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I think the European Parliament has started off well towards the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Th@@ ought to the impressive Mr S@@ ali@@ h Mahmoud O@@ sman .
We have seen some interesting Euro@@ bond proposals .
Mr President , yesterday I was in this House addressing the issue of the European Aviation Safety Agency when I noted that the means by which it was being achieved was through the gradual integration of the national systems .
At the same time , the revision should provide a more level playing field for EU economic operators and reduce unnecessary administrative costs .
She said we all need to stand up and be counted and to strive for equality .
I trust , therefore , that the European Council this week will confirm its commitment to the accession date of 1 January 2007 for those countries .
The majority of those amendments have my support . However , I could not agree on some .
We were misled as to the instructions .
Firstly , comitology .
We are bound to call on the Ukrainian authorities to cancel the second round of the presidential elections and to organise a re@@ run of the second round , but not new elections that would eliminate current candidates .
We condemn terrorism and support Turkey in its fight against terrorism .
There is no demand from our citizens for transnational politicians .
I welcome the swift response from the wider international community , including from governments within the Middle East region itself .
The report has not only looked at contracting industries in the building sector but looked across a wide spectrum of people working at heights .
It is only through discussing the challenges that lie between us in a spirit of mutual respect that we can hope to overcome them .
Each Europe Direct information rela@@ y benefits from an operating grant of a maximum of EUR 24 000 while the maximum grant for former I@@ PE@@ s and Car@@ ref@@ ours was EUR 20 000 .
I thought you were asking a question on the general procedure , which I tried to clarify .
We are all well aware of the scare stories and food mountain stories .
There is , firstly , a proposal from the Group and today there are the recommendations from the Commission .
I have listened to all of this debate with increasing sadness at the way in which the impressive , ambitious rhetoric of the UK Presidency is just not matched by reality .
These artists should have been able to recla@@ im their property that they alone were responsible for creating .
Will it set up a crisis management mechanism at Community and national level ?
I appreciate that Mr Andri@@ a has moved on this and has compromised and added the facility for allowing the services to make proper investments , but we should not prescribe a non @-@ profit status and compe@@ l the markets to adopt this model .
But I hope we will be able to maintain a frequent dialogue on human rights issues .
I believe the amendments that Parliament has approved will make the instrument more appropriate and effective in promoting the interests and values of the EU in these 17 heter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous countries .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , nobody can underestimate the importance of water and the need to manage our water sources well .
Let me say that the provisions that are contained in this particular legislative document relating to food will operate for such time until the general food law comes into operation .
As regards standards of food safety , all food and feed placed on the market in the EU must be safe , irrespective of where it comes from .
The crisis has also once again brought the role of credit rating agencies to the fore .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like to reply and answer the oral question on behalf of Commissioner Mandelson , who was not able to attend today because he is in the process of deep bilateral negotiations on the Doha Round .
That has also produced some kind of my@@ th@@ ological view of the famous declaration of assurance , saying that the underlying transactions of all accounts have errors .
Did they stop and consider the viability of the underlying assets , the fraud risks , the track records of the origin@@ ators and the trends in the markets ?
SMEs are the cornerstone of the economy and it is our duty to ensure that they are supported to the best of our collective ability .
As explained in its opening pages , strenuous efforts have been made to improve its user @-@ friend@@ lin@@ ess so that read@@ ers can easily obtain a clear and comprehensive account of the Ombudsman &apos; s work .
The vertical divisions in society and the domination of tribal loy@@ alties over personal judgment would make that impossible .
I doubt whether the Commission actually has enough staff to build up the controlling bodies with the knowledge required .
Are you aware that there were dam@@ ning reports on the state of those immigration centres by the Council of Europe ?
That seems to me to be an entirely unrealistic thing to do .
It is an interesting point .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - I think , as the real political negotiations will start tomorrow with , as you say , Prime Ministers and Presidents coming from all over the world , we should not talk about a Plan &apos; B &apos; already .
What had they been voting against ? she asked .
We could do it at little more than the cost of business as usual .
It is evidence of the fact that young people are extremely interested in politics .
Through this motion for a resolution we are sending the message that the wish of the people of Zimbabwe , expressed through the electoral process , must be respected .
We see an unfortunate boom in aspects of e @-@ commerce , in the growth of pornography , paed@@ ophilia and race @-@ hate material .
in writing . - When this House considers budget priorities , it does so in the context of massive public sector cuts in EU Member States , rising unemployment , increasing household bills and overall economic uncertainty , both nationally and in many families .
There is no reason why a tightly regulated but open market will not provide an equivalent , if not a higher , level of protection to citizens as any tightly controlled state monopoly .
We are also working with the Member States on recover@@ ies , and we submitted a lot of information to the rapporteur about the situation in relation to recover@@ ies .
I do not put it any more strongly than that , but the High Representative and I have worked as hard as we could make these structures work as effectively as is possible .
However that is not the normal way we carry out our business .
The Minister is flying to India today .
She continues : &apos; There are those who say my father &apos; s death was the final nail in the coff@@ in for a tolerant Pakistan .
Secondly , in its role as EU executive , the Commission should take a rigorous approach to enforcement .
As part of the assessment , public participation will take place in line with the Aarhus Convention .
In deciding on the import regime for bananas there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account and , most importantly , as I said previously , our responsibility to all the different stakeholders .
Nevertheless , the triumph of &apos; communau@@ tari@@ anism &apos; requires that each and every national of each and every Member State feels fairly treated on the basis of their merits .
EU financial cooperation amounts to some EUR 75 million to EUR 80 million per year , for which Tunisia has proved to have a good absorption capacity .
If my memory serves me correctly , Article 42 in the new Treaty makes a specific cross @-@ reference to that .
Now we turn to the other deep @-@ water co@@ ral re@@ efs off the Canary Islands and around Madeira and the Azores , and I hope there will be continuation of protection to those areas on a permanent basis .
As EU legislators we must bring forward proposals which will help to protect the health of our citizens and I believe that the dangers for our health from cigarette smoking must be vigorously highlighted at every opportunity .
The advisory forum is the place for the director to seek advice from his or her pe@@ ers - and the forum would ensure the shared ownership of this venture with the Member States .
More so , in our Union of 25 it will collapse under the weight of its own contradictions .
He stressed that point several times in his contribution .
I particularly welcome his resolution because it resta@@ tes our commitment to the principles of special and differential treatment of developing countries , to the importance of food security and to enhancing the accountability and social responsibility of corporations .
This is a clear case of unfair competition .
While welcoming the statement by the Council presidency on 18 September 2003 , words are not enough .
If we are to take on these challenges the consumer has to be involved and we have to recognise that energy poverty is a real issue for millions of our citizens .
It cannot be right and justified to continue making payments based on how you farmed some 10 years ago .
That is fairly new and I think we owe it a lot to the Irish presidency .
Of course , there is no single solution to the problems facing us , but we can learn a lot from each other by exchanging experience .
Yes , there are still many bridges to cross , but today , in my opinion , we have crossed the Ru@@ bi@@ c@@ on .
We are analysing this at the moment and I think it is futile at this stage to speculate on conclusions .
I will raise these issues at the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly in Jordan this weekend .
The first is the combined impact of reduced resources under the new financial perspective , and the emergence of new challenges leaves us no option but to set clear priorities in the next budget .
I will not go down the road to parliamentary immunity because I want my day in court and I want to make my point and not hide behind some smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en .
One of the plans announced is the introduction of some form of road user charge such as a vignette pay@@ able by all road hauliers , British and non @-@ British alike , for their use of the road network in the UK .
After all , cooperation across borders is what the European Union is all about .
We should be encouraging the uptake of new farming technology and not vi@@ lif@@ ying it .
The focus for the coming year will increasingly be on civilian implementation but it is clear that this will continue to require maintenance of a secure and stable environment .
Firstly , we have offered consistent political support to the new leadership and we have encouraged it along the path of reform .
Will it be possible even for the most hopeful Member States to comply with the sort of deadlines which we set , for example in the auto @-@ oil directives or , more recently , in the directive of which I am the rapporteur , the landfill directive ?
. As I already indicated , this is mainly an instrument for business to engage in .
Do not bring it in .
The rapporteur correctly identifies the major demographic challenges that we face here in the European Union and that we will have to meet in the future .
The original purpose of the Directive was to avoid distortions in trade .
Im@@ medi@@ ately following its adoption in February 2006 , Chris Hor@@ ro@@ cks , Secretary @-@ General of the International Shi@@ pping Federation , said , &apos; This landmark decision is just the beginning .
Which of your colleagues can be right ?
We must see an end to the subsidising of boat @-@ building and put this money into helping fishermen who are coming out of the industry to find new employment .
There has been no change in that whatsoever .
While I do not expect him to give me precise details of his negotiating position , I would like to know what the broad parameters of that flexibility are and if there is a limit .
Civil aviation has to recognise that it needs to be involved in an emission trading scheme , and environ@@ ment@@ alists need to recognise that people want to fly and the aviation industry contributes greatly to the economic well @-@ being of many of our regions as well as national economies .
Therefore , we have to put into practice measures that help women enter or stay in the labour market by improving family life conditions , especially those that facilitate a balance between professional and private life .
But this is always - again I would stress this in the light of what the rapporteur has said - subject to the strict requirement that it does not distort competition .
That fragile nature is , as you recognised , a global concern , not just one that concerns Europe or indeed those nations in the Arctic .
The European Union needs to distance itself from the neo @-@ liberal economic programmes that are being provided .
We have come across the element of conce@@ al@@ ment already in the countries where this has arisen .
Mr President , as I hear discussions on ways to scre@@ w more money out of the little people in the name of climate change , I am struck by two things .
Subject : In@@ vol@@ vement of SMEs in European research and innovation
Mr President , as Chairman of the College of Quaestors , I have been asked to help arrange transport to Parliament tomorrow for assistants coming from Brussels .
Member States may make decisions on invalid@@ ity which are binding on another Member State , although complicated by the degree of invalid@@ ity , but they may have rules against overlapping of benefits .
After all , the European Central Bank is holding its own information campaign , so why should we be duplicating the effort ?
Today , the Commission &apos; s proposals on social policy demonstrate to its detrac@@ tors that Europe cares for community cohesion and that liberal economic policies need be no threat to progressive policies for a healthy environment and a society served by solidarity .
Before presenting my remarks , I wish to recall the context of the Commission &apos; s proposal .
Well , quite often it is because they are escaping from conditions and governments that are no longer able to command their confidence .
This proposal runs diam@@ etri@@ cally contrary to the EU &apos; s life science and biotechnology action plan .
I have requested information myself from the local authority and the regional Commissioner but so far without success .
Finally , during the vote , a majority rejected an amendment which stressed the need for the Arctic to become a demil@@ it@@ ar@@ ised and nuclear @-@ free zone ; thereby clearing the path for the Arctic policy that this resolution calls for to include a militarisation of Arctic and placement of nuclear weapons in the area .
More than 1.@@ 25 billion cross @-@ border journeys are made by tourists within the EU each year .
They say &quot; please give us the chance to choose to eat food that has no GMO in it , that is GMO @-@ free , so that we can make a genuine choice between GMO and no GMO &quot; .
I look forward to working with her and her services in the months ahead , as this dossier moves forward .
This is why I strongly believe that , to be successful , the future EU economic and social model should have ingra@@ ined within it the possibility to be flexible and be applied in a tailor @-@ made fashion to specific sites and situations , as well as being end@@ owed with the necessary flexibility in its application to be effective under different socio @-@ economic scenarios .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Firstly , about bureaucracy and the administrative burden : they exist , no doubt .
The West &apos; s serious military forces did what was needed to be done to confront terrorism .
Mr President , given that external relations is one of the key priorities of the Czech presidency , I would ask the presidency of the Council to outline what moves it would consider taking to encourage the Belarusian Government to lift its international travel ban on children travelling to EU Member States for rest and recu@@ per@@ ation programmes .
If we can take his reassurances at face value , why does he not simply exclude health from the scope of this directive ?
National governments will be reduced to the status of a par@@ ish council .
It needs to be urgently addressed .
For Taiwan , one possibility could be participation via an NGO .
As regards armaments , as I said before it is the same people with the same equipment .
I would like to talk about many other things , but with this speech - and I think I have exceeded my time - I have given you at least an idea of the issues I will be tackling during the next few months .
Mr President , firstly may I write into the proceedings of Parliament today that there was a lot of criticism of my colleagues from the Green Group for dressing up as pirates .
I regret we did not have that chance .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , honourable Members , thank you very much for what has been an important and , I think , very significant debate in this Parliament .
How are we to bring prosperity and opportunity to our rural communities without bringing them the means of achieving these goals ?
in writing . - The Treaty of Lisbon , which entered into force on 1 December 2009 , extended the circumstances in which Parliament &apos; s consent is required for the conclusion of international agreements .
It goes without saying that Mrs Bonino &apos; s role will not be confined to for@@ warding scientific opinions to her colleagues with responsibility for agriculture and industry . She will also be closely involved with these Commissioners in drawing up legislation on the basis of those scientific opinions .
They cannot do this any longer because of the star@@ tling rev@@ el@@ ations this year about the wholly inadequate safety and quality control standards in operation at these plants .
We would have added , and Parliament and Council would have added a number of details and included even more issues in the environmental programme .
In Papua New Guinea , for example , and the Sol@@ omon Islands , they have problems with regard to AIDS .
It would be tragic and hypocritical if a knee @-@ jerk reaction against making anything mandatory at a European level were to be allowed to be jeopardise that commitment on climate change .
It may also contraven@@ e the subsidiarity principle in the Treaty .
I want to ask the Commissioner for information about exactly which NGOs he is referring to and I would also like to know whether any contact has been made with those NGOs during the last six months .
As in all negotiations , compromises had to be found in certain areas but the results are a balanced package assuring market access while preserving specific sensitivities .
Mr President , if you allow me then to reply to the first part of the question , the answer is &apos; within a few weeks &apos; .
Yet I do not see a directive before us to require alcohol to be submitted to all sorts of safety tests , or for bottles of Guinness or Strasbourg wine to carry the strongest possible health warnings .
But we must not condone the creation of ghet@@ toes , where only children of a specified faith are admitted to a school and others are excluded .
Several economists have analysed the effects of this on a Europe @-@ wide level , and have come to similar conclusions that there is , or could be , a beneficial effect on employment .
Mr President , there are some exciting new developments in the whole idea of cross @-@ border and inter@@ regional cooperation , in particular for people like myself who live in a coastal community in Scotland .
In short , it is back to the failed policies of the 1970s .
I make no comment on the issue that was being raised , but this is the second time that access to Parliament has been impe@@ ded by the same demonstrators .
The draft policy document was presented to the Qu@@ int@@ ana Roo local con@@ gress in the aftermath of the seminar .
All installations in the supply chain are part of safety requirements .
In English we say &quot; two heads are better than one &quot; .
I believe the Treaty language is a little misrepresented .
The UN runs an index of happiness and it places the Democratic Republic of the Congo above only Zimbabwe .
We must not spare efforts to help the central government extend its authority to the entire country .
It is madness from an economic point of view , too .
So we can cut expense there .
This means useful competition to stimulate innovation and to spur productivity in those economies , it means lowering the costs of inputs to local industry , it means lower @-@ pri@@ ced goods for consumers in those emerging economies , and it means bringing capital , technologies , creativity and modern management skills to those emerging economies .
That is the answer I have to hang on to .
I am surprised that the President @-@ in @-@ Office , whose serious attitude I absolutely honour and salute , seems to have so misunderstood the tenor of Parliament &apos; s resolution regarding monetary policy .
Such an exploration would only be possible under certain conditions .
Even if we were able to get an agreement on an extradition package in which the US would not apply the death penalty , the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights , to which all of our Member States are signatories and on which the Union is founded , would prevent extradition of suspects to appear before such military tribunals .
Likewise , I hear consumer organisations saying that it is wrong to extend copyright because this will interfere with consumers &apos; rights and consumer choices , again not realising or not giving cre@@ dence to the fact that copyright already exists and that those rights and protection are already there .
- Mr President , saved from the ash@@ es left by the Bush Administration by the election of Obama , the transatlantic partnership is no longer sufficient to solve the main challenges faced by humanity , but it is still necessary .
Let me make it clear that , before tabling the proposal , the Commission carried out a comparative law analysis , the &apos; Com@@ pen@@ dium &apos; , covering the laws of the Member States transposing the consumer directives under revision .
It is my intention to take this into account over the next number of days in the on @-@ going discussions .
That may be a little sad , because it meant we had lost a little bit of mutual trust .
If Japan is prepared to go ahead , then there is the suspicion that the Japanese may want to re @-@ write the crucial proposals within the protocol , notably using the year 2000 perhaps rather than 1990 as the base year for calculating greenhouse gas emission reductions .
After all , his EU pension might depend on him not attacking EU policies .
The desperation of the people on the Tam@@ pa is clear .
But this is a short @-@ sighted and short @-@ term viewpoint , and we need to look at the wider implications .
As Members of the European Parliament , we have a responsibility to ensure that the citizens of the European Union continue to enjoy the right to protest peacefully .
We are committed to making even more effective and targeted use of these instruments .
However , there are those who prey on children and they will use the Internet as much as they possibly can to try to undermine children .
To give you an illustration of what I am talking about , the British Government turned up en masse .
On his visit to Ankara from 6 to 8 October 2005 , Commissioner Rehn urged the Turkish Authorities to take into account the Commission &quot; s comments on the draft law .
The only solution being put forward is to cut greenhouse gas emissions - that is , carbon dioxide - dramatically , because it is claimed that a 30 % reduction will reduce the average temperature of the earth by 2 ° by 2020 .
The gross national product @-@ based resources represent 43 % of this total .
Where appropriate , the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured &quot; .
I very much agree with all those who have been calling for fair competition because only fair competition can lead to fair practice and , of course , to real and not fixed prices .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
Well it is a bit like the leg@@ end@@ ary cu@@ rate &apos; s egg .
A lot remains to be done , and it was very moving to see so many defenders of human rights here this morning .
It is now really important that we move forward into a strategy that really does consider the short , medium and long term but also the breadth of the way in which we can engage as a European Union , as a Parliament , as a Commission and as a series of Member States able to pack this up into one seriously thought @-@ through strategy for the future .
Last November , I challenged Parliament to come up with bold new ideas for improving the internal market .
I have several concerns .
. Although some very good ideas were expressed , it was particularly important for the European Parliamentary Labour Party that the impact on social housing and health services was taken into account .
Parti@@ cipation of Hungary in a Community programme on media is very important because , as we all know , free media are crucial to a democracy .
This is just as much about creating equality of opportunity as removing the disparities between poorer and weal@@ thier regions .
On the one hand , there is a need to cease all armed activity and dismantle the terrorist organisation ETA , but , on the other hand , the political conflict has to be faced and resolved .
Perhaps it is because it is three years since the death of H@@ rant D@@ ink , and there are still serious questions still to be answered in relation to that crime .
So that is , I suppose , where the starting point for this debate must be .
I thank those who played a constructive rather than a destructive role .
This is not as important as the support we have from our own side , from our own Member States and from the Members of this House .
I would like to hear whether the Commission is going to make any effort , or is making any effort , to try to establish whether or not there is a scor@@ ched earth policy .
The Commission intends to use the assistance instruments at its disposal to continue support and assistance to civil society organisations , journalists and independent media , universities and , where appropriate , local authorities .
EUR 6@@ 80 million of co @-@ financed monies intended for the BMW region have gone to Dublin , the east and the south .
Tax authorities need to know about assets in order to help track down hidden income which may be undeclared or originate itself from criminal activity .
As a result , we now have tighter liquidity risk management principles , strong rules on risk diversification , strengthened supervision , a better capital base , and skin in the game , coupled with due diligence requirements for securitisation .
I am glad to say that on the occasion of 3 October we secured the outcome for which so many of us had worked for so long : seeing the accession talks beginning both with Turkey and Croatia .
Mr President , may I say that this discussion once again shows that we have a strong responsibility for the situation in Slovakia .
I am told that the same thing happens at the WTO .
My nation of Wales is currently in receipt of cohesion funding , and given how badly the private sector in this region has been affected by the economic downturn , I and many others recognise the value of these funds to potentially transform the economy .
The Commission is committed to really doing everything to find a fast compromise in the second reading and to get the package agreed .
I believe that my Prime Minister , David Cameron , did a good job in forcing the level of increase down to 2.@@ 9 % but we know that this was a compromise .
Mr President , firstly , may I say to many colleagues here who are directly affected in the Lim@@ burg region , that I represent a region in the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which has probably been more affected by structural change in the automotive industry than any other region in Europe .
in writing . - I fully support Ev@@ el@@ y@@ ne Gebhardt &apos; s report on the implementation of the Services Directive .
The same assessment was provided last year in the preliminary draft budget for 2004 .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , honourable Members , tonight we are discussing a legislative proposal which the Commission tabled in 2005 concerning the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries - the &apos; made in &apos; regulation .
To them , Brussels is one place , Strasbourg is somewhere else .
I was disappointed you did not mention it in your speech , because this is one of the really important parts of your presidency .
I look forward to an early conclusion of the codecision process so that the directive can be implemented by the Member States and we can achieve a high level of environmental protection in this area .
Look , what industry needs is political certainty ; what politicians fail to deliver is that certainty , and we have re@@ ap@@ ed the reward for it .
So it is a matter of solidarity with those countries on the one hand to encourage them to maintain their reform policies - and we have seen that in a number of the candidate countries - without which the future looks even glo@@ om@@ ier , and on the other where we can give a helping hand to alleviate temporary bottlenecks , we will try to assist in that respect .
Secondly , regarding supervision - the main subject of this report - I have spoken on many occasions in the Parliament and elsewhere about the issue of the cross @-@ border supervision of financial institutions .
Madam President , could we take this matter into consideration ?
With the visit of Prime M@@ inster Ko@@ i@@ zu@@ mi to Pyongyang last August , Japan also took a major step forward in opening up dialogue about norm@@ alising relations , nearly six@@ ty years after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea .
Parliament has decided to send a political signal in this respect by proposing an increase in the financial resources available and we welcome this proposal .
Other factors which we need to bear in mind include , firstly , the fact that medium @-@ term to long @-@ term reconstruction assistance is implemented over three to five years and disbur@@ sements are spread over the programme &apos; s duration : 2010 was mainly dedicated to committing funds and launching project preparations , including all necessary technical studies and tenders .
The report conf@@ uses these various aspects . I therefore abstained .
That would be a better approach , both right in principle and right in practice .
They need a special focus , especially through the structural funds , as a key ingredient for the future .
That will come later .
It seems to me that when we are in China , as Jean @-@ Claude Juncker said , or when we are in the G7 , where Jean @-@ Claude and I are signing the communiqué of the G7 , we are doing what is appropriate and if I am myself cautious - because it was mentioned that I am very prudent and very cautious when I speak on exchange rates - it is because we are in a domain which is extraordinarily touch@@ y and a domain where , in my opinion , one has to fully respect the orientation which we have agreed upon .
The financial perspective will be the moment of truth .
What has been the response of Parliament to all of this ?
It has not been solved yet .
We will be cleaning up our act and removing a constant cause for public criticism .
You have been very persuasive in convincing both the Council and the Commission in this respect .
From the economic and financial crisis to energy security and climate change , the Presidency has been stead@@ fast and clear in its objectives and it has offered Europe clear leadership in testing times .
We need to be honest in terms of what we are looking for .
In particular , risks stem from the dam@@ pen@@ ing impact on consumption and investment of further un@@ anticipated increases in energy and food prices .
The Commission is not end@@ earing itself to the general public by taking such a wholly un@@ sympathetic and forth@@ right position .
Turning now to asylum and immigration , I would like to mention some of last year &quot; s achievements .
Perhaps Commissioner Fischler should put him in charge of inspec@@ ting abattoirs .
You all know how important it is to complete the ratification process in order to be able to implement the agreement fully , including its financial component .
I appreciate the consensus in Parliament that your policy was wrong .
It is very painful for the farming industry to see this happen and it is happening now throughout the whole of Europe , so action needs to be taken .
He made it absolutely clear and also did so informally , with the group leaders , when he met us the other day at your invitation , Mr President .
Local supply and local bran@@ ding are keys to success .
As yet , the Canadian Government believes this directive discrimin@@ ates between Canadian oil imports and oil imports from other countries .
I agree with his observation that while the human rights dialogue could indeed be useful , unfortunately up to now it has not produced tangible results .
I am hesitant to talk about sanctions because we have to use the means that promise most success .
EU grid operators will cooperate and develop network codes and security standards , as well as plan and coordinate the investments needed at EU level .
This may happen more often than we think but fortunately this was noticed on this occasion .
The strengthening of the partnership principle continues to need defence .
We adopted the proposal for CO2 reduction in the non @-@ ETS sector . We adopted a proposal for emissions from cars .
On 23 August , the date on which the Nazi @-@ Soviet Pact was signed in 19@@ 39 , we should commemorate the victims of both communism and Naz@@ ism .
At a time when multiple crises seriously threaten the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals , it is all the more important to ensure that our development policies are not undermined by action in other policy fields .
However , I can assure her that she is correct in her analysis , in recognising that one of the main outstanding issues is how to apply the directive : per contract or per worker .
Initi@@ ally , the bulk of hydrogen is expected to come from fossil fuels , firstly without , and then , in the medium term , with carbon capture and sequestration .
At my own airport in Manchester there are Icelandic @-@ registered aircraft and I have been to Iceland more times than they have .
Incidentally , I look at the attendance of Members here today as an indication of the importance they attach to the handling of the taxpayers &quot; money by the European Union .
Do not allow the xenophob@@ es and the anti @-@ Europeans to slow us down .
This new protocol was initialled by both parties on 31 July 2001 , fixing for five years the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in the waters of Mauritania during the period 1 August 2001 to the end of July 2006 .
Therefore , we need to educate the public of the need to recycle waste from agriculture and from sludge , but also be aware that there are down@@ sides to this technology and that producing energy leaves a residue that has to be handled and dealt with very carefully .
in writing . - With the dramatic rise in global food prices , the need to see having enough food as a human right is important .
What makes this especially challenging is the effect that one @-@ sided efforts have on the markets .
Some people might contend that I have not , but I think I have .
Simply put , we need smart energy jobs for all Europeans , not just for those who would have received them even without Europe .
The Presidency , on behalf of the Council and along with the Commission and Parliament , is invited to develop a &apos; Declaration on a European Consensus in support of EU Action on S@@ AL@@ W &apos; , which takes into account the respective competences of all institutions .
If I can offer a ray of optimism to the Member , it would simply be to say that he is not a l@@ one voice in this Parliament in making this case .
I would be pleased to hear whether you accept that we ought to drop the push for investment to be included .
However , recent scientific analysis has shown that , in spite of the satisfactory utilisation rates in this segment , coastal dem@@ er@@ sal resources have plu@@ m@@ meted and have forced the small @-@ scale and industrial fleet to fish in neighbouring countries .
Thirdly , we invite Northern Dimension member countries to be aware of the importance of two EU programmes in our committee &apos; s area of responsibility : Galileo and SESAR , because we believe that the commitment of northern dimension parties to both of these would reinforce sustainable growth and competitiveness in the region .
I think the rest will come up in the debate , and I will then be ready to answer all the questions .
If necessary , this should be done in a horizontal fashion .
In Ireland , some operators are proposing using it in building materials .
What will happen beyond that depends on how much we invest in further research in this area .
However , it should be borne in mind that such fines become part of the European budget only once they are final : that is , if no appeal has been lodged by the undertaking on which a fine has been imposed or when all possible appeals have been rejected by the European courts .
Science has shown illegal drugs to damage the physical and mental capacity of human beings .
They are there and accentu@@ ated by next year &apos; s enlargement .
We are talking about the problems of implementing the European Arrest Warrant in some countries because of fears that there are not minimum standards throughout the EU .
Dear President @-@ in @-@ Office Cha@@ st@@ el , dear High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice @-@ President of the Commission Lady Ashton , dear guests ,
It equally helped Israel to improve its diplomatic and economic standing in the international community .
Indeed Member States are already moving and the Community &apos; s common interest should be kept at the forefront of our minds .
This is a result of quotas , illegal fishing , lack of traceability from fish to for@@ k and , in particular , over @-@ ze@@ al@@ ous regulation , draconian penalties and being undercut by fish imports of dubious quality and dubious origin .
India must do more to tackle child labour and bon@@ ded labour , and must sign up to ILO Convention 98 on the right to organise and the right to collective bargaining .
We need more explanation of what Europe is about .
I note what the honourable Member has said in his contribution .
Without those , I would submit that we are not able to judge whether or not the tunnel is safe .
That said , however , I welcome the Council &apos; s recognition of the will of Parliament on this issue .
The economic contribution made by copyright @-@ based goods and services to the Community &apos; s gross domestic product is very significant .
This is not going to change after Lisbon .
It is up to the Government of Malta to reduce the hard@@ ships especially prevalent on the island of Gozo .
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consul@@ tancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice .
In his speech he is reported to have called for Israel to be wiped from the map and said &apos; the Islamic world will not let its historic enemy live within its heart@@ land &quot; .
We do not want to jeopardise that scheme in any way and we now have enough assurances from the Commission that our concerns will be taken into account .
Nobody is calling for the privatisation of social services .
In that I agree wholly with Mrs Doyle .
There is no need for this phrase in the text any more .
It is only right and proper that we negotiate a new regulatory framework for exports or products not covered by Annex I as part of the WTO Millennium Round .
Will the Commission provide information concerning the outcome of the negotiations it is conducting with the US authorities with a view to definitively preventing - following the decision for a temporary suspension - the activation of the so @-@ called car@@ ou@@ sel retali@@ atory measures as part of the transatlantic trade dispute on hormone @-@ treated beef and revo@@ king the retali@@ atory measures already in place ?
Thirdly , another matter relating to projects funded by the European Investment Bank and involving public procurement procedures is currently being evaluated by OLAF in order to determine whether there are sufficiently serious suspicions of fraud or irregularity detrimental to the financial interests of the EU .
Mr President , at the outset I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr van Velzen , on the preparation and presentation of an extremely balanced report on the important subject of electronic communications .
Repres@@ enting Poland , a country outside the visa waiver regime , I trust that the resolution will lead to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of an agreement allowing all EU citizens to travel to the US on the same terms .
If all six of these reports and their rules only apply to the euro zone , we would be able to more actively support the Euro Group in their decision to strengthen the principles that underpin their monetary union .
With China , we know that it does not respond to health and safety concerns , but it does respond to economic threats .
There are still many tasks for the completion of the European single market and one of these is , of course , the gradual dismantling of state involvement in enterprises .
Direct financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority is already being prepared in the form of a scheme to reimbur@@ se private sector ar@@ re@@ ars , as Salam Fayyad has asked us to do .
Mr Ch@@ ou@@ d@@ hu@@ ry is now facing an unfair trial and has little chance of seeing justice .
I think the words of the Indian Trade Commissioner are worth repeating .
It is very clear that it takes a lot of time and seems very complicated now and then , but at the end of day our cooperation produces solutions to problems that can only be solved through systematic cooperation .
Therefore the significance of the Conciliation Committee is enhanced still further .
The point was made about forests .
As a result , the Council , meeting two weeks ago as was just mentioned , endorsed the decision of the Commission to temporarily put on hold assistance to or through the Palestinian Government and its ministries .
The EU has yet to formulate a proper policy towards the new developments in North Africa .
We are only meant to have two minutes .
A comprehensive database of visa applications with biometrics matched to each applicant will mean that genuine travellers are able to prove their identity easily and travel more freely .
They are all issues worthy of debate , but nothing to do with the Nice Treaty .
Social protection , including the development of the Social Protection F@@ lo@@ or initiative , is another area of interest for this year &apos; s ILO conference .
According to the information provided by the Hungarian authorities , the red mu@@ d does not contain high concentrations of heavy metals and is therefore not considered as hazardous waste .
I look forward to taking this process forward with the White Paper at the turn of the year .
Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group , I should like to welcome this report and to thank Mrs Sö@@ ren@@ sen for her excellent work in drawing up such an important document .
A very detailed questionnaire was sent to the British Government .
No , because they are not informed .
I am struck , in particular , by how strongly the theme of genuine partnership sh@@ ines through ; how the EU / ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique relationship in modern political life and - imperfect as it is - it can stand as a model for new and innovative relations between North and South , which are perhaps today needed more urgently than ever before to build a more peaceful and sustainable world .
With the world population increasing by 80 million per year , it ought not to be all doom and g@@ loom .
But a lot is in the hands of the politicians in both communities in Northern Ireland .
However , exceptional measures are sometimes necessary to deal with potential threats to national security .
Certainly , at the moment it is difficult to get past each country &apos; s various examination systems and teaching philosophi@@ es to reach any objective comparison of the teaching standards of the countries .
Mr President , we all want to strengthen our links with Morocco .
Mr President , the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most lethal since the Second World War .
Whenever we propose any proposal , we also have to take into account the burden of the costs and make things as simple as possible .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , poverty , especially the number of those at risk of poverty , has grown as the EU has grown , with each new Member State adding to the problem , so it is pretty obvious how to prevent further increases .
That is why I agree with you totally that our common endeavours are very important for Europe to benefit .
An FTA with an Asian country will anchor the presence of the EU in that region .
I hope that the maximum number of eligible farmers will opt to participate in this scheme and that the experiences gained will lead to its extension to other farmers in the future .
It also appears discriminatory that the Prime Minister &apos; s daughter , Mar@@ ina Ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir , has not , on the other hand , been targeted by the authorities although she too has been a cri@@ tic of the government from time to time .
On the whole , it has gone quite well .
It has gone well beyond that point because the Ukrainian authorities have overlooked the correct legal procedures and taken measures that violate the rule of law .
I have followed closely the negotiation of this resolution , and do support it , albeit I would like to see us do more .
Member States have until the end of September 2011 to submit the data for the year 2010 .
As Labour &apos; s regional spokes@@ person , I will be calling for a standing item on the Committee on Regional Policy &apos; s agenda on budgetary implementation and scrutiny , and look forward to working closely with the Commission on monitoring funding under European regional grants so as to ensure transparency and accountability .
In paragraph 3 we call on them to begin this dialogue .
I and my Welsh colleague , J@@ ill Evans , have tabled amendments 28 and 29 , which I hope will be adopted tomorrow .
If we are , they will win .
We need the EU to push at Council level for un@@ fettered international human rights monitoring of Chechnya .
I have a very long list of names here , and it would be much more interesting if more Members could ask questions .
I do not want to further infla@@ me what is already a tense situation , but the respect for our Rules of Procedure which is fundamental for the conduct of this House &apos; s business requires that even that particular part of the Rule be respected .
Secondly , I welcome the simplification and flexibility introduced in this proposal .
If we are asked to explain things - e.g. why something was done or was left un@@ done - we are always available to you , to the Ombudsman and to other people as well .
In fact , Europe is engaged with China in cultural , economic and strategic terms .
We have suggested that the Commission should bring to us on an annual basis a comprehensive report on its plans for future motor vehicle regulation , specifying where it is going to use the Economic Commission for Europe proposals and , indeed , covering some of the voluntary regulation process that we have talked about .
I have called for a well @-@ resourced , single government agency , with the power to ensure that child welfare reform happens .
From a national perspective , we retain a veto on any developments with which we disagree , and we retain the sovereign right to decide on participation in any crisis management mission in accordance with our own legislative requirements .
But long @-@ term investment in properly targeted development assistance seems not to enjoy that same priority .
While paying these outrageous fees may put innocent companies under severe financial hardship , the victims are often too small to afford the legal costs of bringing actions against these directory companies .
I am sure the House will appreciate that the important debate on the new Community financial perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 will have an impact on how to deliver assistance to the Western Balkans .
We in the Commission , like you , are interested in a viable industry that can operate without state intervention and without state aid and compete on its own merits .
However , the Community rules allow Member States to derog@@ ate from the mandatory @-@ bid rule in order to take account of circumstances determined at national level .
Mr President , I welcome and support both reports and I congratulate both rapporteurs on those documents .
Yes , we need some crisis management , but we must not return to the days of having intervention - the balance must be right .
The Central Office is being well audited , and when we transfer money , everything is in order , but when it comes down to implementation in a given country , there are too many risk elements .
As for the first point , I very much hope that we can resolve these things ami@@ ca@@ bly , and I am sure that if both honourable gentlemen put the case that they have put to me with equal force to their first cou@@ sins in the United Kingdom Government , that will very much help to resolve these issues without it taking too long .
. The proposed deletion of the indicative amounts for tobacco products and alcohol constitutes only one of the elements of the relevant Commission proposal amending the arrangements for products subject to excise duty .
I recently visited E@@ y@@ em@@ outh in the south of Scotland and will shortly visit both O@@ ban and Camp@@ bel@@ town on the west coast .
Madam President , I welcome this healthcare directive , but I am cautious because the devil will be in the detail .
The study also tells us that only a limited number of Member States regulate agents through a specific law .
Thus , I think we need to hear more from the Commission in terms of assurances and indications as to how sectoral expertise will , in fact , be retained , utilised and respected .
Small and medium @-@ sized businesses such as his were experiencing real late payment delays in other parts of the European single market such as France .
Last October , the Commission formally reminded the Member States of their obligation to provide the information for this new report .
I also have some major concerns , as I have stated before in explanations of vote , about how we do these draft amending budgets .
It is interpreting the existing requirements and how they will be used within the EU .
I should like to repeat a question which I asked Mr Moscovici last week in plenary .
In the case of other countries it means bigger sugar industries .
In relation to the over @-@ capacity of EU fleets , I would like to ask the Commission how it feels about the announcement by the Irish Government yesterday for a EUR 56 million investment package for EU vessels ?
I am also disappointed with the Commission for not being fir@@ mer in defending its own position - do not forget that it is your own position that we are defending now .
R@@ C@@ TV &apos; s history is , unfortunately , stigmati@@ sed mainly by its alleged controversial role in the April 2002 attempted coup in Venezuela .
Although the courts continue to pass death sentences , the Republic of Korea has maintained a moratorium on executions since 1997 .
Without long@@ term guarantees I am not sure it is sensible to talk , as the proposal does , of further adapting agriculture to the marketplace because this usually means lower prices and increased costs for the people in rural areas .
Throughout the process , our group has been very supportive of the accession of both countries on the earliest possible date .
In order to be brief I will simply say that the Committee of Independent Experts made over 90 recommendations .
We must do what we can .
We hope to make swift progress in these negotiations and to be able to conclude them rapidly .
There is urgent need for efforts to reach the MDGs to be redou@@ bled .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I would first of all like to thank A@@ stri@@ d Lulling very much because it is very much on her initiative that we are presenting this .
The Commission , although sympathetic , considers that those measures would be difficult to adopt , mainly for reasons of subsidiarity of an economic or technical nature , or because they are beyond the scope of the proposed directive .
Anyone or any Government who objects to this now will have some serious questions to answer to the European citizen .
Enlargement has proven to be a successful shock absorber for Europe .
There was one test on rats in which massive quantities of phthalates appeared to cause problems , but researchers have been unable to repli@@ cate this test .
At the same time , they will allow the smooth development of policies to safeguard the economic future of Europe .
We are in the last stretch to the finish , but the road will still be rather bu@@ mp@@ y .
Parliament and the Budgetary Control Committee are , however , keen to ensure that the reform occurs at a speedy pace , which is why we have decided to postpone discharge in the expectation that the Commission will hit the targets that we have set them within the next two months .
The discussion on how to meet the Millennium Development Goals is an important discussion .
