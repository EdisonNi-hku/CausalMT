Mr President , Energy Commissioner , thank you for being here . Your presence is very appropriate .
Through this document , the citizens of Europe are promising to show solidarity amongst themselves .
I want to state , in accordance with the Rules , that I was present but did not vote .
The first priority has to be keeping consumers informed and giving them the ability to choose .
This report must therefore form the basis of that debate .
They are also needed in order to attract crucial foreign investment .
In any event , the main task of the European Maritime Safety Agency , which is soon to be created , is to technically coordinate the application of Community rules , and the Commission will study which measures must be adopted in the future , in view of the experiences of the Agency .
Mr President , I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Klaß on her report ; not only is it useful , but also Mrs Klaß has worked very hard , so I would like to thank her very much .
Others have also referred to it .
Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I would like to express our deep concern about the current crisis relating to the Stability and Growth Pact .
That is not a rhetorical question ; we must ask ourselves the star@@ k question of what the priority is for the future of Europe , this Europe that wants to act , but cannot .
None of this will solve the problem , we know .
- Mr President , Commissioner , it is clear that the first thing we should talk about is the actual function of this debate on annual strategic priorities , since in principle the intention was to establish a proper communication with the European Commission in terms of setting its budgetary priorities .
We are not talking about inven@@ ting resources or funds that do not exist . We are simply asking that the European Union &amp; quot ; s Solidarity Fund be applied , which would have been much easier , by the way , if the European Parliament &amp; quot ; s proposals had been taken into account .
The flexibility and pragmatism required in order to achieve specific results should not obscure the picture regarding the agenda , objectives or the result of dialogue .
All of these issues are in the report .
In particular , I acknowledge the difficulties we know he has faced during his work on this initiative .
I think the Commissioner is right : the European Community must appeal this World Trade Organization decision and , of course , we hope the Council will uphold the guidelines the Commission and the majority of the political groups of this Parliament are currently establishing .
I should like to reiterate a number of issues that this House and the Council must take clearly into account when making future decisions .
And that is why we need this Constitution , which is a point of balance , but above all a point of progress .
There are clearly some elements , such as the progress made on certain liberali@@ sations , that are without any doubt clearly positive .
The Convention on Cultural Diversity must be a genuine instrument for international cooperation , which protects and promotes the diversity of cultural content and arti@@ stic expression in the face of the pressures from globalisation and international trade policy .
We must make our voice heard and listen to theirs in order to engage in fruitful dialogue together .
This is a citizen &amp; quot ; s Constitution which must be perceived as such .
Some towns , villa@@ ges , districts , settlements and roads have been destroyed by the earthquake .
So , Mrs Mouskouri , many thanks for your report , which I am sure will work in that direction .
In this regard , I would like to insist once again that in our resolution on the Valencia Conference , we express our unanimous concern at the human rights situation , we defend the need for the situation not to worsen in certain countries with which we have signed association agreements - and the conditions are worsening - and we propose the establishment of mechanisms for applying the democratic clause .
In the construction of Europe , it is extremely important that we can rely on an energy distribution network .
The most regrettable thing is that , by taking this approach , Europe is becoming less and less relevant on a large part of the international stage .
Furthermore , these are figures that many of us would like to see dedicated to the prevention and management of conflicts .
We cannot , however , accept Amendment No 1 .
Mr President , I would like once again to thank Mr Karas for his reports and all the Members who have spoken in the debate for their contributions .
Access to health services for all citizens , be they from the EU or immigrants with or without papers , is one of the basic human rights .
It also contributes to pluralism in the media , cultural and linguistic diversity , ed@@ it@@ orial competition ( in terms of quality and diversity of content ) and freedom of expression .
The situation is clearly complicated , uncertain and worrying .
That identity must exist inside the Union .
These conditions are also needed to ensure the market is competitive and can be exploited in full .
Obviously , such a move could come into conflict with the commitments given within the stability pacts relating to Member States .
Mr President , I shall speak with right on my side .
My country , Spain , is disappointed by this first agreement and we hope that the second phase will be far more convincing .
It is therefore not true that this report goes against an intended Community objective .
The European Council supports the general approach of the Convention .
The text that we are going to vote on is also important because it introduces an innovative financial instrument .
Therefore , this should be thought of as long @-@ term term aid .
Recent social and economic imbalances , international conflicts and climate change will increase illegal flows to the EU .
Furthermore , nuclear energy is currently faced with two challenges , two problems mentioned during this debate : the safety of installations and the treatment of nuclear waste .
Commissioner , this is precisely what we are complaining about ; this is precisely the question we are asking : what has been done to give the United States the idea that they can undertake unilateral action ?
With this action , the Commission would be taking account of the opinion demonstrated by this Parliament through the various amendments that will surely be approved tomorrow .
We are working as hard as we possibly can in that regard .
For all these reasons , and also to express our strong support for the Commission , we have voted in favour , even though our views differ markedly from some of those expressed by the rapporteur .
All of these issues are tackled in the reports in a reasonably balanced way .
Initiatives such as those that we are now discussing are , therefore , of great importance to the European public .
There is no doubt that the objectives for the coming five years are more jobs , better job quality and better social inclusion .
In the context of the previous question , I should like to raise a further two questions which seem to me to be relevant .
The committee of inquiry did not take a decision to table any resolution .
I agree that research has to be promoted , in particular if the aim is the well @-@ being being of patients suffering from serious diseases , and I am in favour of freedom of research but we must always fully respect human life and the dignity it deserves .
We think that we need to move forward and better document the sea@@ bed in each area , identifying where the vulner@@ abilities are , before indicating any maximum depth for deployment .
It will surely be necessary to reassess certain priorities , the common provision of resources and the multinational distribution of tasks .
But how can we fail to be in favour of the Green Paper proposed by the Commission ?
We therefore need to assess and compensate for the effects of trade agreements being signed with third countries and we need to encourage the concentration of supply via producer organisations .
This led to her incar@@ cer@@ ation in a maximum @-@ security security prison , in conditions that are putting her life in danger .
The institutions and instruments that govern this Union are appropriate , especially if we take into account the improvements introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon .
Of course , without these arms , those conflicts would not happen .
Because , Commissioner , European workers , their organisations , women &amp; apos ; s organisations and also , in private , many employers who want a ty@@ p@@ ically European model for industrial relations , are asking us for it .
Of course , it is technology this is coming to the fore , and all the proposals she makes in her enterprising report will help us to continue making progress in the logistical development to which the European Union is committed .
Mr President , we cannot stand by , we have the right and the obligation to prevent this appropri@@ ated money being used for the evil purposes of terrorism .
As is usual procedure when discussing the transposition of measures into Community law , I must once again express my disappointment over the Commission &amp; apos ; s delay in starting to work on adapting legislation .
This report is in line with the Commission proposals , and that is exactly where its strength and positive nature lie .
I am finishing up now , Mr President : one cannot talk to the Council about 20 % solidarity .
We could have produced amendments aimed at revi@@ ving the previous Pact , in the form it then took .
Lastly , we have to regulate more quickly and be more effective .
We therefore cannot accept that they should not be communicated .
We must make the effort to consider how we can achieve better agreements that enable us to protect our interests and , at the same time , extend them to the candidate countries .
Therefore , Mr President , our proposals , which we will specify in another report , together with the proposals of the Commission , which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents .
We all know that this is the key point and that the question of whether or not our agenda is in line with the agenda and concerns of the citizens will depend precisely upon our reaffirming the European social model .
Mr President , do you not think that it would be a better idea - and I say this , of course , as a point of order , not as an intervention - if we waited a few more minutes for the Minister to arrive ?
Do you not agree that the best way forward would be for that referendum to take place , with European backing ?
There is still a margin for manoeuvre ; there always is a margin in politics , though , chron@@ o@@ logically speaking , the time limits are running out , and perhaps the need to act quickly can help .
The issue which causes me some problems at the moment , and which my amendments deal with , relate more to the agricultural aspect of the issue and specifically to the current reform of the common agricultural policy .
I would like to continue with the issue of funds , which the honourable Members have mentioned .
The regulation we are debating today will undoubtedly contribute to improving our action .
On the same day I will have the opportunity to present these forecasts to you when I appear before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
The fight against terrorism is a fundamental priority in the European Union .
You ask us to make an effort ; we really do make an effort every day , everyday we increase contacts and dialogue with the various institutions in order to improve our work .
We cannot accept Amendment No 11 either , since the article cannot be deleted if the text still refers to specific articles of the Montreal Convention , in line , therefore , with the previous rejection .
In conclusion , Mr Commissioner , I should like to ...
But we believe that , for the European Union , this can mean a different form of development .
The answer is yes .
I do not believe that the interests of the Autonomous Communities are sufficiently incorporated into the definition of the policies that the States put to the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should also like to congratulate Mr Graziani warmly on his magnificent report .
We in the PPE @-@ DE DE , therefore , cannot agree with the inclusion of provisions allowing for the existence of stricter rules in the States , unless they can be justified on the grounds of a proven risk to public health .
By putting these modifications in place , we will be facilitating the acceleration of , and investment in projects that will also be important in creating jobs .
As some of you have just pointed out , wind energy is very close to becoming competitive , but we have to continue providing genuine support for the development of renewable energy .
And this is something that we must all do together .
I think that there are deeds which go against the peace process but there can be no greater assault than the irreparable loss of human life .
We talk of animal welfare , but this welfare must begin with food .
As any document shows , we are talking about a review in 2009 .
We now have very important challenges - relating to institutions , enlargement , security , defence and economics - in our own countries and in the European Union .
The Member States and the European Union have applied the open coordination method for exchanging experiences between Member States on this issue .
We hope the recently adopted United Nations Security Council resolution will operate in favour of a political solution to the situation and that the conference mentioned in our resolution will finally be called , which also requires the European Union to engage in joint action as demanded in the text .
Pro@@ posal for a joint resolution on the Commission &amp; apos ; s 5 year Strategic Programme
It is not , therefore , appropriate today to make a declaration on our commitment to the fight against terrorism - which is a given - but it is appropriate to debate with the Commission and the Council the practical measures adopted , the effectiveness of their implementation in all the Member States , and , above all , what more we can and must do .
Because of all this , we must hope that the spread of territorial employment pacts within the framework of the structural funds programmes will become reality as soon as possible , including the possibility of participation by the European Investment Bank .
Madam President , Commissioner , I firstly want to congratulate both rapporteurs of the Committee on Fisheries for their reports which are before us today .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to thank Mrs McNally for her work as rapporteur on this Decision .
I would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis once again and express my gratitude for his work as well as that of the other speakers .
We need to better equip the External Borders Fund ; EUR 1 820 million over seven years is clearly an insufficient amount by any stretch of the imagination .
The first is that - as has already been said , and I join in the congratulations and celebra@@ tions - the indic@@ tment of President Bas@@ h@@ ir demonstrates the importance of putting an end to this situation , especially in Darfur , although it relates to the whole context of Sudan . It also shows that the international community can and must act when such situations reach the extremes that the Sudanese situation has reached .
Mr President , the report by the Committee on Culture will make it possible to improve the current &amp; apos ; Tele@@ vision without Fronti@@ ers &amp; apos ; Directive in order to help the development of a high quality European audiovisual industry .
Nego@@ ti@@ ations on enlargement will mean that a longstanding dream of many Europeans becomes reality .
Madam President , Commissioner , I wish first of all to thank you for being here today and for the statement you have just made , which at@@ tests to the sensitivity you have shown throughout the years towards the European textile and clo@@ thing sector .
However , the presentation of national employment plans takes place at the start of the year .
In this regard , the Union will always be in favour of economic liberalisation and , of course , of political democratisation in Central Asia .
Turning to matters relating to economics and trade , the principle of avoiding further discussion on ongoing contentious issues was retained . Re@@ visiting such issues often only results in over@@ sha@@ do@@ wing the significance of the strong economic links between the European Union and the United States .
First , the governments of the Member States have an obligation to collaborate unconditionally with the justice system and , consequently , it goes without saying that when the Spanish judiciary requests the extradition of this man , we all hope that the Spanish Government will subsequently take appropriate action .
The attention paid to historical and cultural heritage is an example of this . I would like to thank those people in the Commission who have supported it .
It should also be borne in mind that if Turkey joins , Europe will spill over into Asia .
It is also of great educational importance in terms of teaching how to govern and manage the environment .
The Government has also forbidden transfers of quotas between individuals .
Parliament &amp; apos ; s position is to condemn and rule out the application of the so @-@ called called principle of fair return to the European budget .
Secondly , the commitment to international agreements .
Furthermore we , with a European sensitivity and with our history of peace and democracy and our rules of the game , cannot accept that humanitarian assistance is not being provided and we must call for this loud and clear .
The problem is with the citizens , with the frustration which can be added to that which they already feel with regard to certain issues relating to European construction .
Thank you very much , congratulations on this work and please go ahead .
I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs of both reports for their outstanding work .
At 11.@@ 28 this morning we received the following written reply from the services of this House :
Because , as Mr Walter points out in his report , the conclusions of the Madrid summit and other initiatives may remain empty words if they are not genuinely put into effect .
And to finish , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , I want to say that we agree that there should be reasonable dialogue with Turkey , but from a European viewpoint , as you said .
In particular , I should like the translation of Sec@@ tion 19 to be reviewed .
For example , in 2000 , the projects received co @-@ funding funding of approximately EUR 3 million from the trans @-@ European European networks budget and around EUR 16 million from the Cohesion Fund .
Mr President , like many , I am pleased to have a document which will undoubtedly be useful in the process of administrative reform which the Commission must undergo , unavoida@@ bly , in the short @-@ term term .
Mr President , having abused your patience , I impatiently await the criticisms and comments of the other Members , both from my group and from others .
We must continue to pay attention to the problems of the financial system - more capital , restructuring and correction of bank balance she@@ ets - at both the European and global levels .
We should help them and they should help us .
It should be noted that almost without exception they all endorsed the Road Map as the best instrument for attaining the desired objective . That objective involves making it possible for a State of Israel and a Palestinian State to co@@ exist in peace and prosperity within a reasonable period of time .
The EU , Council , and Commission have introduced several motions into the agreement , which are causing concern amongst some Members , who are trying primarily to guarantee that security is not at the expense of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and rightly so .
It is the huge fish factories in America , Russian and Japan which are destroying what needs to be maintained for future generations and we should take a deci@@ de@@ dly more serious approach to this than is nowadays often the case .
Are these people , as discredi@@ ted as they are , going to be able to restore the confidence that we need ?
The rapporteur argues that Eurojust should be informed of any conflict that arises , even where it has been resolved bilater@@ ally between the judicial bodies involved .
We are very aware of the fact that without water , there can be no development . It is essential in order to preserve the environment and to generate wealth and employment , in both the agricultural and industrial sectors .
What we plan is , as part of the Green Paper that is being discussed in Parliament , a series of energy saving measures .
Lastly , it is crucial that the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council plays an active role in this dispute .
This was a message we sent to the Council , that it was unable to negotiate sufficiently last week .
We have always been clearly in favour of this system .
It seems to us that such changes do not help to restore consumers &amp; apos ; confidence either .
Thirdly , Madam President , there is the question of dialogue .
I therefore make a public appeal for the Chamber and the Member States to support this legislative package during the forthcoming plenary , as it will certainly enable us to tackle the major challenge that faces us .
This is the problem that we should be concerned with .
I believe this is a great challenge for the industry , which I would encourage to seek new sources of competitive advantage through this research and to initiate , with interest and good will , close cooperation with this Parliament .
Nonetheless , these amendments by the Committee on Budgets were approved by the Committee on the Environment and I must defend them here .
Moreover , this Charter reflects the opinion of Parliament , as we set it out in our Duff / V@@ oggenhuber Resolution on 16 March .
The second misunderstanding is that the European Parliament has blocked the relaunching of such cooperation .
Firstly , the European Union must support and facilitate the processes of democratic change .
Therefore , that policy harms that country and its workers .
Sy@@ mb@@ ols get this message across quickly and clearly .
What I mean to say is that , in any event , I share the Commission &amp; apos ; s concern and I think the proposal to simplify the procedures is a positive one .
We do not believe that this is the most appropriate way to consolidate a European company which would act in accordance with the reality which we have achieved thanks to the European internal market and the monetary union .
It is certainly the case that the training required within the European Union may not be impar@@ ted or may be ev@@ aded when seafarers from third countries are recru@@ ited for European Union vessels Such individuals are engaged because of the shortage of Community professionals and may well lack the necessary training .
Mr President , as you know , the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports your decision .
I believe that this would be to mis@@ interpret the report .
To this end , controls must be strict and sanctions vigorous .
We believe that prevention , protection of resources and halting the deterioration in the quality of water , as well as repa@@ iring the damage , are priority issues for the European Union &amp; apos ; s water policies .
The respect for democratic values is , and must continue to be , the central pillar of political dialogue between the European Union and the countries of Mercosur , both on a regional level and on a bilateral level .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I will try to be very brief , but I wanted to make a few brief comments on some of the speeches that have been made .
Mr President , I am extremely pleased with the draft report to be put to the vote tomorrow in this Parliament , because it takes up - with some amendments , it is true - each and every measure I proposed in the initial draft .
I should like to add two things .
Commissioner , in the meeting that we had on the day before your meeting with the European Nuclear Safety Regula@@ tors Group ( EN@@ S@@ RE@@ G ) , my group explained to you what our position on this question was .
All of this , which is theoretically the basis of European policies , must also be a code of conduct for the multi @-@ national national companies .
Mr President , I remember that very recently this Parliament approved a joint resolution stating that this crisis was unprecedented and required urgent action .
We believe that the Commission is taking its time .
However , the issue he raises in recital B is also very important : that the aim of the Common Fisheries Policy should not necessarily be a reduction for the fisheries sector .
Today , de facto solidarity exists and Europe is preparing to adopt its Constitutional Treaty .
This is completely unacceptable .
Let us hope it acts soon .
Recently , this Parliament approved an opinion on the future of the olive oil COM which seemed to establish a certain consensus .
Therefore it is vital that there should be a rapid , effective mechanism of this kind .
Well , Mr President , it is one which is dictated by common sense .
Of course , it is essential that we have a legal framework in place as soon as possible .
The plan which the Commission adopted in 2002 to modernise its accounts is due to take effect in 2005 .
I should like to put a specific question to you , Commissioner , in view of the fact that this appointment has provoked a mixed reaction in Spain .
The speeding up of the process is therefore an important issue which has been taken up by Mrs Lambert .
The step that has been taken in relation to the 25 national reform programmes is important , but I believe that we should place extremely great emphasis on a very thorough assessment of the progress made with those national programmes .
This republic is of great value to the European Union in strategic terms and its stability is of utmost interest to the Community .
Mr President , I would like to point out that the dialogue between the governments of the different Member States must be the main tool for resolving problems , especially in the case of neighbouring States .
It is not a case of addressing just one of the problems . Clearly there can be no peace if the violence continues , but equally there can be no peace unless we solve the underlying problems .
That is why I wish to congratulate the Commission and the Commissioner in particular .
However , at the same time , the European Union is implementing a policy aimed at the removal of tariff barriers which , in my opinion , is affecting important quotas .
I have a little less confidence in the Council , as I said earlier .
As he correctly reminded us , the appeal decision will probably be ratified on 25 September , and then the Commission has a month to decide what to do - whether to implement the decision or propose some type of compensation .
This , it seems to me , is a question of a few balanced and fair protocols enta@@ iling a cost for the European Union which is reasonable .
Regrettably , the Union has not acted in the most appropriate way up to now .
We need to adopt measures in order to map out financial risks .
He should also be congratulated on having responded - on his own initiative but with wide general support - to this concern about the transparency of our institutions .
Mr President , hitherto all proposals for reform of the common organization of a si@@ ze@@ able market have been preceded by a discussion paper so that the consequences of the proposed measures could be assessed .
Prime Minister , I must echo the words of welcome expressed by all my colleagues in my Group in an act of respect and parliamentary courtesy which I very much feel has not been extended by the PSE Group .
One point I should like to highlight is that of structural reforms .
De@@ aling with deforestation , the destruction of the forests , clearly forms part of the Spanish Presidency &amp; apos ; s objectives and we understand that it is necessary to apply some of the instruments which the European Union has at its disposal , for example , the Non @-@ Leg@@ ally Leg@@ ally B@@ in@@ ding Instrument , on all types of forest , and the European Union &amp; apos ; s action plan on Fo@@ rest Law En@@ forcement , Governance and Trade which , for example , stipulates the creation of a legal framework to prevent the importing of illegally fel@@ led wood .
It is essential that we strengthen political , economic and social ties and continue to move forward .
Now I see that he is arguing for a progressive integration of something which Parliament , at that time , argued for before Amsterdam .
The Member States are part of a political project and the relationship between their tax administrations must be consistent with that political project .
I am talking about terrorism of course , but also human trafficking , crimes against children , illegal drug and arms trafficking , corruption , fraud and organised crime .
However , I would first like to congratulate them and particularly Mr Dell &amp; apos ; Alba who has done some excellent work on a routine yet fundamental issue .
Other cases involve profound , sometimes radical , modifications of the legal and regulatory framework , and this cannot be done by the Commission alone .
The decision fores@@ aw that Spain would participate in IA@@ T@@ T@@ C decisions in line with the Community position and in close cooperation with the Commission , which guaranteed the Community &amp; quot ; s effective participation in the IA@@ T@@ T@@ C .
The amendments which I have said are not acceptable include , specifically , Amendment No 14 , on the consultation of the interested parties within Eurocontrol , as well as the amendments in the report by Mrs Sanders @-@ ten ten Holte , Nos 13 , 16 , 25 and 29 , the second part of Amendment No 15 and Amendment No 33 , which has become obsolete as a result of technological progress .
The first is to push ahead with the process of liberalisation in sectors such as telecommunications , postal services , railways , etc . , sectors which still hinder the possibility of achieving higher levels of competitiveness and a single market which functions better .
It is a proposal for the future .
I believe that the directive currently being presented by the Commission , on the rules relating to the conditions to be fulfilled by residents of third countries requesting refugee status , moves in this direction , and it will be very important .
The question is in which direction this Commission is heading .
Monetary policy must continue to sustain demand , but it cannot bear the whole burden alone , especially in view of the current situation of the financial and credit markets .
We would like to reach an agreement during the Luxembourg Presidency .
I began by saying that I was very frustrated , but I can also see that there is some possibility that we may inch forward a little .
Mr President , the best thing about asking a question is that you get an answer , even if , in this case , it could be considered disappointing in some ways .
The report must be rea@@ dable .
We will see , Mr President , when we read the conclusions .
Mr President , in this my first intervention I should like to say a few words about the Commission &amp; apos ; s ruling . I shall outline our differences with Mr Fri@@ e@@ dr@@ ich &amp; apos ; s report and refer also to our final position .
In fact , as our colleague Mrs Cre@@ ţ@@ u commen@@ ted , this has demonstrated political will , showing that we can do our bit in se@@ ar@@ ching for solutions to the present crisis . This crisis is actually causing genuinely difficult situations and poverty for European citizens .
This jeopardises the entire credibility of the Common Fisheries Policy and its own future as such , something that should not be assumed before the 2012 reform .
Also , in order to attain our objectives , to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment , it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies , to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies .
Mr President , the need to promote the development of sources of renewable energy becomes a crucial matter every time that issues such as the Kyoto protocol and meeting our commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are raised or when we talk about sustainability in energy policy .
Third , the issue - and it is a very important one - of Palestinian unity .
Our basic message is , therefore , that the margin for making tax cuts must be counter@@ balanced by strict public spending controls .
The work carried out by the rapporteur has been extraordinary in dealing with an especially difficult and complicated report .
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered , and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government , but also at the Socialists , who are European citizens as well , because , at the moment , the Austrian Socialists are being described as tra@@ itors to their country . I will say one thing .
Madam President , I must start by regretting the absence of Commissioner Fischler .
Firstly , it must improve its administrative capacity to complete and enhance the application of the Community acquis .
Specifically , the Committee of Independent Experts &amp; apos ; report proposes that the Union Treaties be amended in order to give the European Ministry for Public Affairs far @-@ ranging ranging powers .
I would therefore like to congratulate our rapporteurs - Mr Pe@@ x , Mr Poignant and Mr Di Lello - on their efforts and their contributions to complemen@@ ting and improving the Commission &amp; quot ; s proposals in relation to these indispensable deterrent measures .
Without the transfer of resources from Israel to Palestine , however , there is little else the international community can do .
The opposite is the case , we are giving the judicial system instruments to enable it to better protect everyone &amp; apos ; s freedom because , faced with the free movement of crime , we must open the doors to the free movement of justice .
Parliament , which represents European citizens , plays an essential , leading role in security matters .
The Action Plan presented by the European Commission is necessary .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your clear explanation , which seemed to me to be rather short .
As regards the two central str@@ ands I have identified in the review , the one that really worries me is the decoupling of aid , as some Members have already mentioned .
The Commission therefore recommends that the remaining Member States that are still preparing their up@@ dates should follow this example , not this year , when unfortunately it can no longer happen , but in future years .
It is important to do away with any hint of confrontation between the few bodies responsible for the organisation of air transport .
The question is clear . More than a question , it is a request : at the end of the process , will the agreement with China be subject to the approval of Parliament ?
All this is reflected in the Sco@@ ttà report , in which other considerations are also highlighted which the Commission will need to take into account when implementing this policy .
With regard to Amendment No 3 , however , I would like to make an additional point .
For one thing , the great issues are being identified .
Having said that , I believe that another debate is now opening up which until recently we had not taken into account : the possibility is being proposed of the European Parliament acquiring more of a say in decision making , taking a step further by means of the codecision procedure , calling for a twin legal basis for this Regulation .
The armed conflict in the area can only be resolved by way of a political solution .
Madam President , I would like to begin by warmly congratulating Mrs Smet on her truly remarkable report , the principal virtue of which is its timeliness .
There are certain points which I believe are interesting , but which concern me .
We want a little more effort from the Commission on this problem .
The European citizens are very concerned that freedom of movement should not be coupled with the free movement of those people who wish to use it to threaten their security .
For these reasons , Commissioner , the Committee on Agriculture presented the oral question which has led to this debate .
The possible effects on the economy of regions and even whole countries could be very serious .
Where there are violations of these universal rights , the European Union condemns them publicly , and we have done this with Cuba .
And what I regret is that this proposal of ours should not be accepted and that it be raised from 23 to 27 years .
I had the honour of participating in that process on behalf of the world parliamentary community in my capacity as the then President of the Inter @-@ Parliamentary Parliamentary Union .
The security forces cannot take on the correct mindset if we are fighting terrorism in a generalised fashion .
The fight against crime , in all its forms , including terrorism , and today more than ever it is once again appropriate to repeat that terrorism is included , is , and will remain , at the top of our agenda .
And on these points , Parliament can be sure that the Commission will continue to make progress .
Parliament is helping you ; it is helping you to reduce the Governments &amp; quot ; margin for discretion .
The rapporteur has already mentioned the long process of debate and joint work between the parliamentary groups with the industry , the Commission and also with the competent administrations of the Member States and finally a compromise was achieved last November following an extremely long conciliation which , if I remember correctly , lasted twelve hours .
This package also , incidentally , regulates the rating agencies , because - in relation to one of the suggestions or questions put forward by Members - the rating agencies are going to be subject to supervision by the European authority .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch .
If we in the European Union are incapable of trying to change the way in which the settlements are being established , there is little chance of any peace initiative having credibility .
It is therefore essential , amongst other things , to encourage and promote the culture of dialogue .
It was a decision made by the Human Rights Committee in Geneva , together with Mrs Rob@@ in@@ son , the new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , who is working with us extremely well .
It is a question of restrictive criteria , but that does not mean that important events will not be included .
Both amendments refer to the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco which is one of the most important of the Community &amp; apos ; s Agreements , and which in my opinion has been tan@@ ta@@ moun@@ t to an abandonment of responsibilities by the Commission in accepting the extension of the biological moratorium period from two to four months without sufficient guarantees - or rather without any guarantees at all - that Morocco will actually comply with that biological moratorium .
The Union is also committed to annual payments of EUR 20 million between 2001 and 2005 .
It is the subject of constant and tough discussion .
This is a very serious commitment .
My concern is that we in the European Union often express excessive amounts of will , we make statements but then they are not followed up by actions because we lack resources .
Amendments Nos 5 and 7 are not acceptable to the Commission either .
Mr President , Parliament does not take a corporate position .
Russia may and must be criticised , but at the same time she is an unavoidable strategic partner , and the deepening of cooperation is a mutual interest .
That is why we are concerned .
It is therefore necessary that we reach an agreement in the Doha Round .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists presented a series of amendments intended to reinforce the content of this directive .
Mr President , the case we are now considering deserves to feature in a guide to what not to do in politics in terms of managing public affairs .
My question , Commissioner , would be , given this concern for sustainability , would you accept my invitation and that of my Group to visit Andalusian fishing ports , to come fishing with us for a couple of days , to see the problems of sustainability , the social and economic problems and the alternatives ?
The present proposal is less complete , if you like , but no less effective .
I do think , however , that all of it should be taken into account , given that the whole world is waiting to see the European Union &amp; apos ; s reaction .
Mr President , I would like to make a short personal statement in relation to the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s comment , which I think was inappropriate and particularly un@@ worthy of a Commissioner who normally deals with Parliament and each of its Members in an excellent way .
The following elements need to be added to this : our own policies , aimed at fulfilling our emissions reduction targets at both national and Community level ; the boost provided by innovation and intelligent energy use ; the incorporation of adaptation measures for sectoral policies ; and consistent external action .
I hope that the process of European integration , which I admi@@ re , will not lead you to ignore what is happening in a continent which has great potential .
Mr Khanbhai , I congratulate you and thank you for the important contribution you have made in your report .
You will remember that , both in Bosnia and now in Kosovo , the problem of an international police force is still great and remains unresolved .
I said this just this week , on Monday , to the Eurogroup ministers , and I also made certain specific comments about how they could be taken up .
So this firm initiative from the Commission , with its high quality and wealth of consequences , encourages Parliament to act in fulfilment of its co @-@ legislative legislative function .
Countries such as Spain , Mr President , have presented action plans which have been highlighted by the Commission itself for their tough@@ ness and for their objectives .
I therefore welcome the report wholeheartedly .
My second point is that I regret the fact that the resolution does not refer to the disappointing role played by the Organisation of American States throughout this process .
I must tell you that , over the coming weeks , we are going to approve a new report , because from now on those reports will be published by the Commission every six months , rather than every year .
Ladies and gentlemen , I sincerely believe that there is room for negotiation and consensus , and I hope that , for the benefit of all , a good result will be achieved in the next round of negotiations .
We must maintain our efforts in this direction as a great deal still remains to be done .
Signific@@ ant efforts have been made to strengthen not only political , but also judicial , cooperation , thereby strengthening the ties between Eurojust and an@@ alo@@ g@@ ous institutions in the United States .
To close this debate , five proposals for a resolution have been submitted in accordance with Article 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
As the claim is incompatible with the purpose and content of the draft regulation , I therefore voted against its adoption .
I therefore urge the Vice @-@ President President , with the support of this Parliament - because she knows that we support her - to take on , following the approval of the reports we are currently debating , the difficult task of trying to convince the Council to come to an agreement quickly .
Member of the Commission . Mr President , thank you very much to all of the Members for their contributions .
Finally , to promote a reform of public pensions systems with a view to ensuring that they are sustainable through consolidation of public finances and incentives to supplement them by means of individual plans .
A@@ voi@@ ding Europe &amp; apos ; s commitment to investment and employment is not acceptable .
The President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council has given me a very committed answer , which we already knew .
Two @-@ thousand thousand @-@ and and @-@ one one saw one of the most important changes in Turkey &amp; apos ; s process of democratisation : the adoption of a package of 34 amendments to the constitution , which is the most profound change that this fundamental legislation has undergone since its entry into force in 198@@ 2 .
This training programme is therefore essential , in my opinion , and should be implemented as soon as possible , because it would be a method of prevention .
Thanks to the invaluable contribution of the Luxembourg Presidency , in July the Council expressed its agreement with the text approved by Parliament , which I will sign next Wednesday .
Respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities in Turkey must take precedence over cooperation and aid in this respect .
This will clearly have significant positive effects for security , not only region@@ ally but also globally .
But we are also against the deaths of - I believe - thousands of innocent civilians in Afghanistan .
Therefore , we will do everything possible to ensure that the consensus approach will allow this report to be effective .
In this respect , we believe that participation in the United Nations Human Rights Council , including support for the existence of the Council , is a position that must be upheld by the European Union .
Mr President , the title of this resolution on child labour , which we also support , is contradictory , because at that age children should be at school , not working .
This does not mean , Mr President , that the European Union should issue a blank cheque : it must defend its positions when necessary , as on the issues of the death penalty , the International Criminal Court , the Kyoto Protocol , Guantánamo and laws with extra @-@ territorial territorial effect , and the United States will have to respect the European Union as a factor for stability and balance within the world .
In my opinion , decoupling is ethically unacceptable .
Because of this , as Mr Watson expressed so well , the task of the EU &amp; apos ; s institutions is not to produce an exhaustive list of measures , but rather it is time to establish the foundations , the pillars and even the fields of operation for the European institutions to play a role in the fight against terrorism .
I would like to thank the Commission for having taken on the Spanish Presidency &amp; apos ; s initiative and for having come out and said , &amp; apos ; O@@ K , we will act quicker than that , we will put forward the proposal next week &amp; apos ; .
That is to say , if this Parliament com@@ missions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said , but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem , where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on , ad infin@@ it@@ um .
There is probably little more she can say in reply , but I do share Mr Salafranca &amp; apos ; s concern , in the sense that the Commission and the Council should reply to a letter Mrs Albright has written to Mr Helms .
I think we must show that we share that concern by introducing transitional measures , once the ruling is known , until there are legal grounds for approving the various regulations that will authori@@ ze the actions provided for .
The European Union can provide an important added value in combating such violence .
Fortunately the European Union is an economic , financial and commercial power .
Furthermore , we need clarity and responsibility in respect of the victims .
It is true that much more is needed .
We asked the Commission to make a really creative effort to achieve an intermodal system based on solidarity and thus maintain consistency in our European commitment to a co @-@ modal modal logistics chain . This text contradicts that in its partiality .
I believe that we effectively have the right to respond to the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office &amp; apos ; s intervention and afterwards each of us should have the right to a supplementary question .
Ladies and gentlemen , let us not start building the house from the ro@@ of .
Efforts will continue to strengthen democratic institutions and the Rule of Law , paying particular attention to human rights and the strengthening of judicial systems , with a view to guaranteeing the equal treatment of all people before the law .
It is clear that the issue of enlargement is one of the fundamental subjects for the Seville European Council and I therefore believe that the information I am going to give will indicate the key elements of what the Presidency and the Council are going to propose to that Council .
It is a political problem , a real problem and the proof is that we are discussing this initiative , which is an initiative specifically designed for Austria .
We must not forget that the balance between security and freedom is not only a demand that is coherent with our shared history , but that it is the only thing that can guarantee stability and , therefore , democracy .
Some of the positions held by the Commission have been accepted by the Eurogroup , which issued a statement on 4 June adopting these points .
That therefore implies a threat to the environment , un@@ profitability , incompatibility with traditional nets in the same waters , conflict between fleets , real difficulties as regards control and the risk of commercial sanctions .
So I think we should let the court do its work and only indulge in political interpretations once the court has made its decision .
It is clearly up to the Irish government to define its spending priorities .
I fully agree with the honourable Member that what has to be done is implement the agreements reached at Lisbon . The Lisbon reforms must be carried through , implemented and developed in all Member States of the Union .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , we are maintaining that position .
No distinction should be made between national and international terrorism because , in the world in which we live , terrorism is global and the Member States alone do not have the capacity to combat it effectively .
In conclusion , Mr President , I would remind the House of the element of risk involved in the tre@@ e subsidy system from the point of view of rural depopulation and the environment .
I am bound to say that I have engaged in a good deal of debate with the rapporteur , but he has consistently displayed a constructive attitude , even though we have not reached agreement on certain issues .
I think that this is a framework directive that - and I agree with what has been said here by several speakers - is going to promote a new culture in terms of water in European countries , based on criteria of efficiency and quality of water resources .
This is , of course , largely although not entirely due , in my opinion , to the war with the Palestinians , which is incompatible with prosperity .
It is the case that current commercial exchanges are very modest - and this is reflected in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy &amp; quot ; s text - even with the facilities provided by the system of generalised preferences and , furthermore , these exports , which are not sufficiently diversi@@ fied , are constantly subjected to reductions in international market prices .
The fact is that the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council has already made this commitment in a letter to the President of Parliament , but we will still have to uphold it when the time comes to negotiate .
In some cases , we are talking about the survival of the sector in Europe and also about the possibility of relocation as an appropriate response to developments .
The rules of exploitation must therefore be addressed in the plan , and this means that fishing quotas must be established on the basis of stock estima@@ tions obtained from scientific reports .
In the same vein , I am delighted by the mention in the final point of the conclusions of the peace process in Northern Ireland , but I am also surprised to see that there is not the least reference to the threat to the European citizens , and to the Spanish citizens in particular , represented by the breaking of ETA &amp; apos ; s ceasefire .
Furthermore , I hope , and feel that , there are undoubtedly different ways in a democracy to express needs , demands , aspirations and objectives .
But I also believe that , in compensation for the many things that have been demanded today , this Parliament must make a commitment to doing something which seems to me extraordinarily important : the Barcelona process is going to be a key element of the Presidency .
Firstly , the European Union must begin a dialogue with all of the parties , including Hamas , in order to promote a stable unity government .
I understand the importance of your assessments , but we must abide by the Rules of Procedure .
The fifth framework programme should of course include some action in this respect .
However , we do not support just any development policy .
Madam President , firstly I would like to reassure President Prodi .
It was a question of seeing how we could establish a dialogue ; how we could talk to religious leaders and promote all those good practices which could help to overcome such conflicts .
Mr President , I must confess I was pleased to see you come in , because I was practically under the impression that I was going to be the only person in the Chamber .
Much has been said about innovation .
In relation to the Dimitrakopoulos @-@ Leinen Leinen report , so that there may at least be an intervention by groups on such an important report , I would propose that in this case the Questions to the Council be cancelled , and in that way all of the groups could express their view , since this is a very important matter for Parliament .
Clearly , renewable energy sources can make a major contribution to meeting these challenges .
On the one hand , to have a consensus document , drawn up previously in January in New York , has the positive effect of allowing the participants to dedicate their time to meetings and achieve very significant bilateral commitments , to participate in round tables .
I did indeed say to the President of the Commission that he ought to resign if ever he decided to stand in the elections to the European Parliament . I said more besides .
We learn from our mistakes .
Let us hope that in the building of Europe such acts - which are totally unjustified - can be completely eradicated .
Therefore , I would like it recorded in the Minutes that I was in the House and that I did not vote because I disagree with the whole process that has led us to the motion of censure .
I have been in agreement with this proposal and I have tried to work alongside the rapporteur , Mrs Jeggle , precisely because it is clear that there was some reticence and that there were some members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who did not think that this proposal from the Commission should be supported .
And we must also make a joint effort in Parliament to be able to adhere to a complex timetable which is an obstacle course we must overcome with a common political will .
This is an important point , which will require the European institutions to adopt a firm stance in relation to the Kingdom of Morocco .
4 ) Naturally , innovation can contribute to substantially improving working conditions and also the integration of certain groups , such as disabled people .
However , in reality , the European Union &amp; apos ; s proposal is the most advanced one available at the moment .
The trade chapter must be based on the principles of fair trade , taking account of the imbalances between the countries of the European Union and the Mediterranean countries .
We need to revise the principle of relative stability and we need to look for new approaches to management that are more flexible and more adaptable because there have been problems with the TACs and quotas .
As a result , we should welcome some of the proposals that improve on previous provisions , such as the introduction of a mandatory post @-@ marketing marketing monitoring system for products , the introduction of clear risk assessment criteria , the classification of the experimental rele@@ ases of products , an improvement in administrative procedures and increased transparency throughout the process .
Thirdly , it insists on the need for a sufficient level of funding for external measures , with a view to making the Union a genuine global interlocutor .
Parliament should also have given its opinion some time ago , but we always lag behind on these issues .
It is a political commitment , it is Poli@@ tics with a capital &amp; apos ; P &amp; apos ; , and it is the European Union &amp; apos ; s foreign policy .
I support all the points that have been made and I would like to add another . I am talking about those people who cannot exercise their rights because they are under pressure from certain quarters , certain organisations .
We want transparency , but we want this to be tru@@ th@@ ful .
We therefore agree with the proposal in this question , which seems to us highly appropriate .
Finally , it is important to work towards an automatic extradition procedure within the framework of an area of freedom , security and law , in order to achieve a European legal and judicial continu@@ um , which continues to respect basic rights and democratic control , and maintains the legal nature of the proceedings , without damaging people &amp; apos ; s rights to defence .
It often finds itself in the middle , between some partners at the same level of development , which very frequently do not share our ideas and are not quite so generous , and developing countries which , naturally , do not agree with us , because they have the right to demand much of us and , often , much more than we can normally give .
They can rest assured that the European Union and this Parliament will always be at their side to help them to consolidate the peace , democracy , and stability to which Iraq , like any other nation on earth , has a right .
Madam President , I have requested the floor in order to speak about Tuesday &amp; apos ; s joint debate on fisheries .
Mr President , in relation to the appeal to public opinion which we are making , I believe we must clearly affirm the principles of democracy and transparency and also the chain of com@@ m@@ and .
But despite that , here we are , we have come this far , and these political positions simply add more problems and difficulties to the problems and difficulties we have already had to face .
Does it benefit Parliament , which is accountable to the citizens of the European Union ?
The Commission can , however , accept all the other amendments , which strengthen or clarify the text .
Mr President , Commissioner for Transport , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking as rapporteur for the Group of the European People &amp; quot ; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats on the report on the European Union &amp; quot ; s relations with Russia and China in the field of air transport .
Indeed , we are about to amend our Rules of Procedure to make official what is already a reality , what the different Union institutions have been doing for years .
Mr President , on 27 May 2002 , the Council adopted Regulation ( EEC ) 8@@ 81 / 2002 in the aim of transposing a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions .
I am very pleased that the Ombudsman is here with us .
For this reason there must be exceptions , which are , of course , limited , so that those areas can be Objective 1 and can take priority in receiving aid .
More detailed information on all these issues can be made available later . I simply wished to give some indication as to our initial position .
This situation will prove beneficial for those operations that would otherwise be too risky for international investors , which will be of benefit not only to developing countries , but also to small and medium @-@ sized sized businesses in our own countries .
Furthermore , both the Commission and the Bank increasingly work on the basis of national poverty reduction strategies defined by the developing countries themselves .
On our continent , Madam President , we must drive forward the association agreement with Russia , but only on the basis of respect for international law . In this context , we must very clearly emphasise respect for borders and human rights , develop the neighbourhood policy and , at the same time , promote association and stabilisation agreements .
If the Cunha report had gone no further than this , that would still have been quite a lot .
Mr President , I requested the floor for an oral amendment to this Amendment No 1 .
I agree with the rapporteur that a Commission initiative is required in the field of training in order to encourage young professionals to join the sector .
Madam President , in general terms I support the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s report as an expression of the long @-@ standing standing concern about the rigidity of the common fisheries policy when it comes to tackling problems which are entr@@ en@@ ched in our fisheries management system , of which discards are simply another example .
There were members of the Convention that voted against - and there is one very notable oppon@@ ent amongst us today - but there was a sufficient majority , a sufficient consensus .
And this is a problem , ladies and gentlemen , which transcends the borders of the European Union .
In addition , with regard to including the &amp; apos ; territorial &amp; apos ; concept , we must be aware of the need to take account of the specific features of certain regions , such as their geographical disadvantages , their outermost position or the depopulation processes in certain regions .
This , ladies and gentlemen , is added value .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Interinstitutional Agreement is something this House must maintain .
Its solidity and duration are guaranteed if we are able to make progress on our Agenda for reform and create a stable framework that favours growth .
Firstly , the role of the Commission and the appointment of its President .
In this context we also wish to highlight the imbalances in the internal distribution of these fishing allowances by the European Commission amongst the Member States , as was the case with cep@@ hal@@ o@@ po@@ ds in the agreement with Guinea .
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives , but Parliament &amp; apos ; s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained .
I wish to ask whether a study has been made by the Presidency and the Council on the volume of fu@@ tures in connection with food markets and hydrocarbon markets , and the extent to which this may be indiscrimin@@ ately raising prices .
I believe that everybody , the Commission , of course , but also the Council , and in particular the Eurogroup , the European Central Bank and the European Parliament , have the responsibility to explain to our citizens that this European project , eight years after its creation , is currently yielding very good results .
Mr President , I will try within the time available to me to comment on the four reports presented to us .
Many thanks , that is all .
We are here to serve the interests of citizens . For that reason , the Commission has always made every effort to cooperate with the Ombudsman on the day @-@ to to @-@ day day handling of individual complaints .
Allow me to make a personal comment : welcome to the club of former Presidents of the European Parliament !
Furthermore , it provides for procedures for resolving cases where there are barriers to intra @-@ Community Community trade .
I hope that the Commission will do everything that the Commissioner has said and that the Council is up to the job .
We need to hold a reasoned debate on the possibilities available to us , in terms of sources and the guarantees of supply , in the light of the Kyoto commitments .
This is a summit which intends to slow down climate change and at which the Kyoto Protocol will undergo its or@@ deal by fire .
Firstly , a reduction in the standards which need to be included in a regulation or directive , that is to say , which require the participation of this Parliament .
I would remind you that this Group , the PPE @-@ DE DE , does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones .
To conclude , I must confess that I was tempted to begin a more detailed discussion about the future of the control system after the reform .
There is a need for privacy , since privacy is a political asset .
In order to increase its legitimacy , quality and coherence we need to continue to reinforce the principles of better regulation and democratic scrutiny , improving the integration of its levels and promoting greater inter @-@ sectoral sectoral convergence in order to avoid arbitr@@ age .
On this basis , our relations will be strengthened .
Secondly , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , I believe we should also try to introduce some vision and some idealism into this debate .
However , as you are aware , the work does not end with the adoption of this directive .
We need a realistic , flexible and , above all , applicable directive .
You will probably support the recommendation to approve at second reading the amendments approved at first reading , with a view to quickly beginning the conciliation procedure , as pointed out by Mr van Dam , who is replacing Mr Caveri .
It will depend on the governments whether or not this subsidy is requested .
The current state of the European textile sector has partly arisen as a result of infringement of international and Community market rules , such as those relating to respect for the environment , and social and intellectual protection .
Other areas are going more slowly , which is the case for trade and investment . In any event , it is very important to us that there are solid clauses and solid agreements with Russia on trade , investment and energy .
Therefore , from this point of view , I am aware of , and agree with some of your concerns , such as the processing of documents concerning the second and third pillars , which must be resolved with all the guarantees required by the circumstances , the facts themselves and by the sensitivity of the matter , as is done in many national parliaments , with guarantees of security and of confidentiality .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for what he has said , because I believe that his views largely coincide with my own , and everybody in this House is well aware that I am one of the Members of this Parliament who are very pleased every time that a new fisheries agreement is signed .
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well , and the result , which we have received today , is moderate and thou@@ gh@@ tful in a very delicate area .
We do , of course , support these conclusions , as well as the conference that was held in London on 27 January .
So I think we need to be very careful in introducing changes of this kind .
In order to make a report that was thorough , useful and as complete as possible , we needed to have more data available and therefore also decided to request information from Member States .
I therefore share the desire expressed by my colleagues the Chairman of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , Mr Westendorp , and Mr Rapkay , that we should adopt the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal , for various reasons .
I also share some of the opinions of previous speakers .
I would like to remind you that the only response that there has been so far when we have encountered an unexpected need has been to take money from agriculture to fund other things .
I think that the time has arrived , Commissioner and Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , to abandon rhetoric and to take action .
I must particularly condemn the way in which this atro@@ cious murder was committed : a 13 @-@ year year @-@ old old gir@@ l was ra@@ ped , she was then accused of adul@@ ter@@ y and then five men - if we can call them men - hurried to stone her to death , even preventing someone from trying to save her , in a sta@@ dium with around 1 000 spectators .
We will have to look for formulae that are more imaginative and more creative in this area .
Just one more second , Mr President , to say that it should also be possible for us to be flexible in our use of the budget .
We cannot allow this procedural game .
Another problem that we also have is with those populations for which we do not have any sort of assessment .
We want to help in the integrated mission for police training , and for training connected with justice and the rule of law in order to enhance institution @-@ building building .
The countries which are not currently members of the Monetary Union have the right , like other Member States , to information campaigns .
The European Union - this Parliament , most directly - must send an unequivocal sign of its firm commitment to combating this violence which kills hundreds of women and which makes thousands of them suffer unjustly and avoida@@ bly .
I hope that the Member States which have greater responsibility for facilitating these agreements are sensible enough to do so in the near future .
For all these reasons the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal is disappointing and we believe it is unacceptable .
The same Article K.@@ 1 of the Treaty on European Union provides that the cooperation described in Article K.@@ 1 will apply without prejudice to the powers of the European Community .
The European Union pays a fair amount of financial compensation and the agreements are beneficial for the development of those countries and at the same time keep our fishermen in employment .
If we really want road safety and the health and safety of workers , it makes little difference whether they are self @-@ employed employed or salaried .
Thanks to his capacity for negotiation and for work on the whole of this issue , which is furthermore very complex , we have been able to make rapid progress .
Mr President , our Group , the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , shares many of the considerations and opinions on enlargement contained in Mr Brok &amp; apos ; s report and we appreciate the enormous effort he has put into his courageous report .
For the first time , a report has been presented that is not purely of a general nature , but which emplo@@ ys the technique of tabling amendments to the Commission &amp; apos ; s recommendation .
Of course , we would have liked a constitution with more qualified majority voting in social areas , on taxation , on foreign and security policy and with a better interinstitutional balance .
We are completely against - and I would put it that strongly - the transfer of quotas between Member States .
We therefore have to re @-@ establish establish conditions of full employment , employment adapted to the society which is taking shape , which we are all building .
First , the statement by the President of the Council must be welcomed with satisfaction , especially coming from this Presidency . I have not forgotten the role played by the Netherlands in resolving a 500 ye@@ aro@@ ld dispute between Israel and Spain .
The physical reality of the euro affords us the opportunity to make further progress in the process of integration .
That is not what we are debating .
My group is therefore opposed to drastic cuts , which can be brought in over longer periods .
I would like to say to you , Mrs Ashton , that the fundamental element that will ensure that these relations move forward in the coming years will be the mobilisation of political will .
Thank you very much for your cooperation , Mr Blak .
As well as immediately meeting their humanitarian needs , we also face the problem of where to place these refugees , as this debate is demonstrating .
Mr President , Italy currently holds the Presidency of the Council , and a distinguished Italian , Mr Prodi , is President of the Commission . Consequently my first words must surely be words of condolence to the Italian people following the tragic events of recent days .
The Commission is aware of the inadequacies of Community legislation and so continually issues documents saying that we have to legislate better or we have to simplify the legislation .
We hope that this ambition is shared by the Member States and by the Commission in the Communication it is preparing , so that a clear and well @-@ defined defined message can be sent regarding Europe &amp; quot ; s commitment to Latin America .
( The oral amendment was adopted )
I believe that this is the moment to send a clear message from this European Parliament .
In any case , between now and the last day of this legislature what we really need is a strong and determined Commission . I would say that the same applies to the Council .
Madam President , I am rising to speak about what has just been said by Mrs Morgantini .
In the budgetary procedure for 2001 , our political group has maintained a strategy of pursuing a marked improvement in the quality of expenditure and an improvement in the mechanisms for monitoring its performance .
In view of this intermodal conflict it must be recognised that the Commission has acted in a reasonably balanced manner in its proposal .
Secondly , and much more importantly , if we really believe in the European project and if we want to carry on being relevant , we must react now .
What does this involve ?
On the one hand , there is what is known as macro@@ prudential supervision , through the European Sy@@ ste@@ mic R@@ is@@ k Board , which seeks to prevent serious crises , to guarantee financial stability and to reduce disrup@@ tions to the financial system .
Although I was not present , my vote , of course , supported the Committee .
Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the fight is not against the phenomenon of terrorism .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Blokland , once again for the magnificent report he is presenting us with today .
Mrs Li@@ o@@ tar@@ d , we will now vote on Amendment 15@@ 8 , which is a motion for rejection , and once we have that result I will respond to your observation .
In addition , we must maintain the requirements - and the control of such requirements - for products coming from third countries .
I believe that there is not ; I believe that the situation is precisely the opposite .
I am sure you can imagine that it will not be I who dis@@ agrees with these ideas .
I will not go into any more detail , because I believe that the main points have been made clear by Mrs Mus@@ car@@ din@@ i and Mr Naïr in their speeches .
Legislative work is perhaps normally less interesting than own @-@ initiative initiative reports but it is just as , if not more , important .
We may be on the verge of a classic banking crisis of withdrawal of confidence .
The Commission needs to exercise its right of initiative more actively - with aid , compensation , restructuring , innovations - in order to mitigate the costs that the sector is suffering from and curb unfair competition in imports .
If we believe in the United Nations , we must support it and we must strengthen it .
If we want to respect the current internal solidarity and be able to finance enlargement , we will have to exceed the ceiling of 1.27 % of GDP and maintain the level of contributions from the weal@@ thi@@ est countries , which will be those that profit most from enlargement .
We are also counting on the information that the Commission must send out regularly to us in this regard , as the Commissioner has pointed out .
We need open , non @-@ discriminatory discriminatory and effective access for renewable energy to grids that are sufficiently developed to cope with large quantities of electricity from renewable energy sources .
The Commissioner responsible , Mr Solbes , has given us an initial presentation with regard to the approach and the timetable , and soon the relevant specific documents will be presented .
Mr President , I have requested the floor in order to re@@ but some unacceptable personal remarks , but I have essentially requested the floor in order to thank my colleague , Mr Coelho , who has spoken not just as a friend , but also with knowledge of the facts .
That is all for now .
It is now a matter of getting credit to flow back into the economy , since it is a vital ingredi@@ ent for the economy to work properly .
We see that there is still some doubt , but there is still hope from the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s words .
Madam President , although European livestock generates over 40 % of added value in our agriculture production , it is also true we now lack sufficient raw material to feed our animals .
The Commission , the Council and Parliament must act together , in a coordinated and transparent fashion .
Madam President , following the result of the vote there are certain inconsistencies , but they are minor .
Mr President , the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 16 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 28 , 29 , 32 , 33 and 34 .
Mr President , in 1997 , the Commission approved an interpretative communication - and I stress interpretative - on intra @-@ Community Community investments , which was not submitted to the European Parliament or to the Council .
I certainly welcome the idea of creating a common ethical space .
The need to push forward these trans @-@ European European networks is a concern shared by the Heads of State and Government , which was expressed at the Barcelona European Council only a few months ago , and it has been asked that this text be adopted both in Parliament and in the Council before December 2002 .
Fortunately , the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament are in agreement about ratifying the timetable for the introduction of the euro agreed at the Madrid European Council of 1995 .
The rapporteur takes a positive view of the Commission &amp; apos ; s publication of a Green Paper to identify the obstacles standing in the way of private actions and to find ways to remove them .
The issue of State Aid and the need to control it has been a longstanding objective for the Commission and for the whole European Union .
The media occasionally report on the tragedies that occur , sometimes with the loss of human lives .
I would like to reiterate my appreciation to the rapporteur and the rest of the Committee .
Cambo@@ dia does indeed have a recent tragic history of flagrant human rights violations and , in the past , horren@@ d@@ ously violent wars .
With regard to the other substances in Annex 3 , I must say that their potential restriction must be based solely on safety criteria and we do not , therefore , support the amendments aimed at introducing positive lists to regulate these substances .
Com@@ plying with the rules and adopting a coherent approach are the best ways to protect the interests of the fishing industry in the long term .
A decisive step has been the conclusion of the negotiations at the accession conference held yesterday .
The first thing identified and criticised in the report is the unjustifiable gap that exists between the substantial financial contribution from the European Union and its Member States to UN actions and the meagre political influence that the European Union has in terms of defining and implementing those actions .
The best way to express our solidarity and our support for the process of democratic consolidation in Chile is clearly , Mr Patten , and you were there recently chairing the negotiations , through the European Union offering our Chilean friends an ambitious cooperation agreement .
It would not be good to give the European citizens and workers the impression that the Commission shows signs of flexibility when allowing other types of aid , while being extraordinarily strict when it comes to employment aid .
Let us not forget that , in order to guarantee our security , it is essential to promote dialogue and integration between cultures and religions , without forgetting development cooperation .
So the purpose of this debate is very clear : to indicate the main lines of action that Parliament thinks should be proposed to increase competitiveness and thereby guarantee the survival of the European textile and clo@@ thing sector .
Use may be incorrect and therefore the sources of risk may be many and varied .
It seemed very difficult , but all indications are that it will be achieved .
Mr President , we in the European Union must support any action leading to the abolition of the death penalty .
The plan must be drawn up , adopted and implemented in a transparent and trustworthy way , through cooperation between all the public institutions , and the involvement of the private sector and civil society organisations .
We are clearly opposed to it .
We will also do everything possible to persuade them to fulfil all their obligations laid down in both the OSCE Treaty and the current Treaty on Conven@@ tional Ar@@ med For@@ ces in Europe , the rea@@ da@@ p@@ tation of which will probably be approved at the Istanbul Summit .
We believe this effort should be maintained , because it is one of the best ways of gathering information on the situation the institutions are in .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are always debating tourism in the European Parliament .
However , the holders of such visas cannot move freely within the European Union except to travel to the Member State that issued the visa .
It has been suggested to me that I speak today on two fundamental issues : the situation in the Middle East and the policy on Iraq .
I am highlighting this obvious fact because if the Commission continues with its hesit@@ ant proposals on biofuels , we will not achieve our objective for 2020 .
Finally , reform of the budgetary procedure must be based on simplification with a view to greater democratisation , legitimacy and transparency .
To be honest , I cannot understand it .
The best way for this Parliament to respond to the phenomenon of terrorism is to be united in the resolution we are going to approve tomorrow on Iraq .
Mr President , Mrs Attwooll &amp; apos ; s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States . This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002 .
In giving greater priority to public investment , which I fully support , we must not however forget the other side of the coin : greater public investment does not necessarily mean increased deficit .
It is therefore true that there are a great many difficulties .
In economic terms , the United States and Europe have the best bilateral relationship of economic cooperation , trade and investment in the world .
In any event , this is a constitutional issue .
With regard to stability and security , apart from the priority of terrorism , which is absolutely universal , the Swedish Presidency proposed a consideration of the demographic future of Europe .
Mr President , I believe that the proposals for regulations that have been submitted to us by the Commission are important and necessary and , on the other hand , it was also important and necessary for us in the European Parliament to insist on the principle that has been insisted upon by the two rapporteurs , Mr Zwiefka and Mr Deprez , which is the principle of Community competence .
I would like to stress , Madam President , that it is very odd that the people who have complained most about the insufficient role played by the European Union in relation to the Iraq crisis are the ones who are most reticent when it comes to consulting their public and asking them to provide this policy with sufficient financial resources .
We need to support these conversations , these negotiations , which are basically conducted by the Commission .
The current situation is not only bad , but cha@@ o@@ tic .
The second is to ensure that the European internal market becomes more competitive at international level .
The problem regarding the content of the dialogue and of the members who take part in it is , and will always be , contentious .
It must be stressed that the fruit and vegetable sector represents a considerable percentage of final agricultural production in the European Union .
Such measures need to be designed to build a minimum of confidence , and they must be verifiable .
I would like to end by referring to some of the questions that have been raised .
For example , during the euro campaign , there was an agreement at the time between the European Commission and the government of a Member State .
The demand that manufacturers provide proof of the composition of foods , and that there be an exhaustive and up @-@ to to @-@ date date list of authorised raw materials and rigorous controls of suspicious materials - and their immediate withdrawal from the market - must from now on be essential issues for us .
To this end , not only are we calling for recognition as historic nations , but also a role in the democratic decision @-@ making making processes .
Madam President , in the second half of the tw@@ enti@@ e@@ th century , and especially in the last three decades , democracy and respect for human rights have made enormous progress , but there is still a great deal to be done .
And here I believe the United Nations and above all the European Union need to play a fundamental role , taking responsibility for the political and social reconstruction of Zaire .
It is that the defence of human rights , Mr President , is the basis of our ideology and the foundation of the judicial order both of the Union and of the various Member States .
What I have actually said and will now reiterate is as follows . Unfortunately , it is very likely that the Protocol will not gain the number of ratifications needed for it to come into force .
Ladies and gentlemen , European policy towards the Balkans is underpinned by a clear principle : the principle of the inviolability of borders , and respect for the territorial integrity of States .
We also agree that we must have the capacity for rapid reaction in the face of the kind of threats to health which we have seen recently and continue to see .
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union , now and in the coming years . It must be taken into account that we have an open , globalised and very competitive economy .
To summarise , a key issue for the upcoming summit , in my opinion , should be the strengthening of transatlantic relations , including at institutional level .
I saw the President of the Commission repeat to you in this Chamber , on his recent visits , that the Commission is going to regulate hedge funds , and that is what we shall do .
Mr President , the approval of the resolution on regional and minority languages will provide a fitting end to the European Year of Languages .
At the same time , we must focus on those who wish to become citizens of the European Union , the citizens of the candidate countries and try to engage them in the most noble aspect of our great adventure , which is not simply discussing budgetary issues , but sharing a common destiny founded on peace and democracy .
The European approach meant that various factors could be taken into account that should always be taken into account when something extraordinary happens such as what we are going through at the moment .
The Group of the European People &amp; apos ; s Party fully supports the solution that we have arrived at with this joint text .
Mr President , I am participating in this debate in order to demonstrate my position and also to demonstrate our desire to support any positions which will contribute , both in Parliament and in the European Commission , to the achievement of the new agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco .
It would not be so difficult .
I would also like to make a second comment on the need for a regional strategy , a regional approach .
I am not making - and this Parliament is not once again making - a humanitarian declaration .
I do not believe that that is the best way to try to justify the need for a reform , although I agree that it is needed .
The sin@@ is@@ ter distinction between murdering terrorists and political terrorists , between armed w@@ ings and political w@@ ings , only makes the whole thing even more criminal to the detriment of the law .
Madam President , I should first like to congratulate the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office for the tremendous work carried out at the Berlin summit .
All ports should actually be monitored , be they colon@@ ies , tax havens or ports of convenience as some have been described .
Therefore , Commissioner , we for our part must make every effort to consolidate this strategic association between the European Union and Latin America , which these partnerships with Mexico and Brazil will stimulate and move forward a long way .
The Community has also improved the policy of assistance for coastal developing countries , which are the main victims of the kind of fishing we are debating today .
Mr Vitorino , you know perfectly well that we share your concerns , the work that you personally have explained to the Committee on Freedoms , the scoreboard and the priorities that the Commission has set for all these issues .
Do you not believe that the European Council at Laeken should include these issues in the future debate on the Union and the distribution of competences between the Union , the Member States and the other institutional bodies ?
The policy must have three fundamental facets : it must increase accessibility , improve competitiveness and strength regional integration .
Nevertheless , I would suggest to the rapporteur and honourable Members that they reflect further on the remaining amendments .
We should push forward with an additional policy of analysis , information , training , motivation , consul@@ tancy and monitoring to give a boost to new structures and opportunities for development and progress .
We are not speaking corpor@@ ately of the importance of the European Parliament but we are talking here about Europe &amp; apos ; s democratic fabric .
I must admit , Commissioner , you are acting splen@@ di@@ dly in this matter .
Given this context , the European Union must develop a democratic system of laws to protect these minorities , creating the conditions for Member States to tackle problems within a framework of frank dialogue with organizations supporting these groups .
The State of Israel was founded as a result of a decision of the United Nations , a David which is an expression of a world political and moral commitment and that David must listen to us and conform to the repeated declarations of the Security Council .
There is concern in the textile industry about its expiry and about the fact that the conditions of the agreement between the United States and China are being extended until the end of 2008 .
Those countries have gone on to become members of the Union , thereby benefiting themselves and also the existing Member States .
Honourable Members , the SAVE programme is intended to provide a framework of action in the field of energy efficiency .
What we can consider is what is being done in the various employment programmes , and that is the implementation of certain elements which will allow us to move towards full employment .
We are in time to ensure that they cease being wron@@ gs .
His presence with Javier Solana in the Middle East was an important step forwards , which we must support , because it is crucial that we make progress with the Mitchell report and move beyond this point of departure .
Some other issues were raised this morning and this afternoon .
Mr President , I am speaking in order to express my support for Mr Fava &amp; quot ; s report , and I hope that he will receive the backing tomorrow to continue his investigation .
I believe that this demonstrates that there are no perfect situations and that we all have to make progress in order to prevent situations of this type .
We knew that the Irish referendum and the elections in various Member States ( Sweden , France and Germany ) would have to be overcome , and now the second stage is beginning .
Last year &amp; apos ; s resolution also stated that the European Union should adopt a different , non @-@ militaristic militaristic position , which supports the defence of human rights , dialogue and peace .
We also think that , generally speaking , the guidelines contained in the Commission communication are the right ones , as well as the emphasis on this particular aspect contained in the motion for a resolution which means that the PPE Group wishes to congratulate Mr Pompidou and also the Commission for its communication .
If that happens , we will be able to once again en@@ th@@ use the citizens about our shared Europe - and more strongly , too .
We are talking about an extreme situation that demands an immediate response .
This means that the negotiations have entered their final stage and I hope that the next European Council in Brussels will be able to nomin@@ ate which countries will be able to complete the negotiations this year .
However , we will not know this for sure until some budget procedures have been conducted under the new rules .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , what could be done ?
Finally , the European Union must promote a series of binding regulations for companies in order to make them responsible for the possible negative impact of their activities on the environment , the social and employment situations of people and peoples and human rights in general .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have given presentations to this House on three occasions and I have appeared here on three occasions .
We have been discussing this issue here .
Mr President , I propose that we all have the right to a second brief intervention which would compensate for that hypothetical supplementary question which we would otherwise have the right to .
I feel compelled to relate this afternoon &amp; apos ; s debate to the subjects of these reports , above all by referring to the current economic situation .
Europe &amp; apos ; s huge industrial assets need to be re @-@ directed directed to sei@@ zing the first @-@ mover mover advantage in tomorrow &amp; apos ; s markets .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , it is true that the measure I suggest in my question would not necessarily break the deadlock in the peace process , as you say .
However , two questions have to be borne in mind : on one hand , that the system proposed has a general scope for all farm products .
On the subject of the citizens , and going beyond what is laid down in the Treaties , I would like to ask the Presidency what role it intends the European Parliament , which is going to give its opinion in May , to play in this negotiation ?
I therefore fervently support the van den Burg and D@@ ǎ@@ i@@ an@@ u report .
I think that harmonising the social policies of the different Member States cannot do anything other than benefit all Europeans .
Both agreements fall within a general European Community policy based on our presence in the rest of the world .
Commissioner , you ought to be taking note of what I am saying because this constitutes a precedent .
The decision @-@ making making rules in place need to be changed so that they can adapt properly to these new times and necessi@@ ties .
I know that you are very aware of the responsibility we all share in relation to the problems of concern to Europeans today , which cannot be resolved without more Europe .
I shall end my presentation with a few words about the state of the administrative reform launched by the Commission in 2000 .
We would therefore do well to have two ways of ensuring transparency .
I hope that in the future , the allotted time can be adhered to but , in any case , I wish you great success in your work as a Member among us .
I fully expect that tomorrow this Parliament will support the Lamassoure proposal en mas@@ se and I hope that this will serve as a basis for work in the Convention and later in the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is also essential to strengthen the role of the European Parliament , and I believe that with the amendments , which are likely to be voted for tomorrow , the European Parliament will be able to perform a greater consultative role in a process of interinstitutional collaboration .
I therefore understand that both Amendment No 33 and Amendment No 37 are acceptable because they may lead us to a more realistic solution to the animal feed control problem .
This process complements our bilateral relations with our ten Asian partners , as well as our relations with ASEAN , and contributes to the process of integration in Asia and in Europe .
I shall conclude by saying , Mr President , that as the rapporteur points out in his report , since the creation of the European Community , no single issue has affected people &amp; apos ; s daily lives as much as this .
The proposal is highly important , Mr President .
The reality is that this House has given its opinion on fundamental issues concerning the reform of the olive oil sector .
Mr President , our group - the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left - would like to thank Mr Romano Prodi for his presence in the House today .
It is a preliminary report and the Commission has set itself a deadline of 30 June of this year . In other words , it has given itself a week or two to receive reference material and points of view from the sectors involved in production , from the social partners , et@@ ce@@ tera , and on the basis of that information , it will undoubtedly draw up legislative proposals .
Throughout the last half century , trade barriers have been breaking down for products , but largely these barriers still stand for the consumers .
I think that in general terms , while there has not been unanimity , there has been a broad consensus on many of the matters that we have covered in the first part of the debate .
Those priorities should translate into greater de facto solidarity , a solidarity which will enable us , on the basis of balance and of mutual respect for diverse interests , to continue consolidating the greatest period of peace , prosperity and freedom Europe has ever known .
The same cannot be said about direct intervention in specific cases that we are aware of .
Mr President , you spoke of a realistic and intelligent defence of the prerogatives of this House ; you mentioned the Lamfalussy report ; also , yesterday you decided not to attend the Court of Justice and to adopt a long @-@ sighted sighted approach on a matter vital to Europe &amp; apos ; s citizens .
This is doubly concerning because the fact that this compliance has to be monitored and required makes us wonder what perception the sector has of its own safety .
I therefore think it is extremely important that the Commission &amp; apos ; s work should be preserved because , without the Commission , we would have created an organisation of intergovernmental cooperation which would lack the necessary integration .
Nonetheless , there are important sectors in which the instrument could be helpful to the Commission &amp; quot ; s policy on nuclear safety .
My second comment is that there is certainly going to be more regulation of financial services . In fact there is more regulation already .
Therefore , representatives of the Commission and the Council , let us take advantage of these agreements to insist on this immun@@ isation which we have to demand sooner or later in order to have a broader and more radical policy against tax havens .
We can undertake to implement it as soon as possible .
We once again have to say that the conflict we are facing will not be resolved until the Palestinians are free from the 1967 occupation and the Israelis feel that they have peace and security ; until the Israelis and the Palestinians can live in two States , with secure and internationally recognised borders .
I believe that the future of Europe , Mr President , will involve overcoming five challenges : completing enlargement , creating more efficient and democratic European institutions , effectively combating terrorism inside and outside Europe , providing the Union with the financial resources it needs to implement financial policies and , finally , to turn the Union into a factor for peace and development at global level .
Mr President , there are three starting @-@ points points to my report :
In my view , the Presidency would do well to set aside the debate on net fiscal balances and look for solutions to its problems that keep faith with the Treaty .
Parliament and European industry must know this as soon as possible , since we believe - and after this debate I believe it too - that while the world markets are not stabilised , transitional protective measures are still necessary .
Finally , I congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for accepting my request concerning a code of ethics for OLAF , which is absolutely essential : on one side we have those responsible and the guilty parties , and on the other the innocent parties , whom we must protect by all means .
Mr President , in the context of the necessary evolution of the common fisheries policy , changes should never be rejected outright simply out of fear of the unknown .
Madam President , the representative of the Presidency @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council said that a rigorous assessment must be carried out .
Why should we all act together ?
Is there confusion between the institutions that have an executive role ?
What is more , who would support it given that EU support alone would not suffice ?
Governance is an issue that cuts across all policy areas , not only the environment .
The opening up of the markets means that the sector has evol@@ ved in very diverse ways .
This is why we are discussing education and employment .
We must not forget that this proposal for a decision complements another one we examined recently on general health surveillance , and this is how it should be seen .
As a result of their invi@@ sibility , many women working in the sector do not enjoy social and economic rights .
In the last few hours , significant legal decisions have been taken in my country which affect this debate .
In mine , in this report , what I want to stress is this : first of all , Commissioner , the fishing industry in the European Union must start to sha@@ ke off this almost domestic or almost marginal image that it currently has , perhaps because of the fact that it is confined to peripheral regions or because of the col@@ dness of the Community GDP contribution figures that are always being mentioned .
Ladies and gentlemen , when I am in the Chair I usually do not vote .
Of course , we support the notion that our fellow citizens should have work and employment , but there is also a political union structure .
I would also like to point out , as does the report , the need to simplify the procedures for granting aid .
Mr President , I am sure that we are all aware that piracy and counterfeiting constitute a very serious problem .
This is where the question arises .
I hope that the debate today and the vote tomorrow will conclude the discussions on this directive and that we will therefore be able to adopt a text at second reading without the need for a conciliation procedure .
Furthermore , a significant number of women who are victims of trafficking enter the European Union every year , according to the International Organization for Migra@@ tion .
I do not think we have the right legislation for applying this principle of competence to the regional bodies , in order to allow them to manage the cohesion funds and the structural funds .
It has also considered the need to appoint a European Union judge to the Court , the participation of this Parliament in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , and the participation of the Union in the Committee of Ministers when it exercises functions relating to the application of the European Convention on Human Rights .
Madam President , today we feel collective grief and sorrow for the death of so many immigrants who were hopeful , desperate , and also perhaps dece@@ ived .
All cultures should and do have the ability to adapt to democracy and individual freedoms .
In my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women &amp; quot ; s Rights and Gender Equality , I shall refer specifically to those relating to the gender dimension .
I believe that the structural reforms that have been carried out over recent years , together with the budgetary discipline and the macroeconomic policies , the mix of macroeconomic policies implemented since the launch of the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union , are beginning to bear fruit .
It is our sincere belief that this agreement will assist this young republic in consolidating its new @-@ found found democracy , in developing its economy and in completing the process of transition to a market economy .
I think this is certainly a far @-@ reaching reaching proposal ; it is an ambitious proposal and requires important decisions to be made in the Member States , and we would ask them to rise to the challenge it entails .
However , doubts arise due to some negative points in this scenario .
I just want to make four points , which could be seen as le@@ vers to help you act , elements to support you in making the common foreign and security policy ever more worthy of this name .
Given the ob@@ s@@ cur@@ an@@ tism of the Spanish Government and its Minister for Industry , I feel you should take it upon yourself , Commissioner , to inform domestic consumers and small and medium @-@ sized sized businesses in some of the least favoured regions of the Union - the one I represent , for instance - that this will not be the case .
In future , all new proposals must be accompanied by an assessment of their compatibility with the financial perspective and its needs with regard to lists of budgetary posts .
These are the comments I wanted to make on behalf of the Commission on the economic situation and the budgetary forecasts .
It is clear that this model &amp; apos ; s logic of private profit has been harmful , and therefore the &amp; apos ; polluter pays &amp; apos ; principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences .
However , I absolutely agree , as suggested by the Committee on Transport , with the need for every type of precaution to be taken , for travellers and European citizens to be guaranteed total security in relation to the application of this technology , if it is applied , and for current studies and tests - which are merely studies and tests - to provide positive conclusions .
I therefore believe that we should draw up codes of conduct which include standards of political decen@@ cy applicable in all of our countries .
We are aware that when a resolution such as this one is approved in this House , it has to be done by a majority .
We believe that we have to support renewable energy sources as much as possible .
Therefore , on behalf of my Group , I have asked the President of the Commission for a Commission statement on economic and social cohesion and enlargement .
Mr President , the previous Commission worked under the motto &amp; quot ; do less in order to do better &amp; quot ; , as opposed to the supposedly active approach of the Delors Commission .
Well , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the final decision that has been adopted . The way things stand is that each Member State will set up an independent authority with the resources and powers needed to adopt the best possible decisions in the shortest possible time .
Europe must reconcile its agenda with that of its citizens and workers , otherwise it will not achieve economic integration and it will definitely not achieve political integration , which is our plan . Our plan is to build a Europe with great political ambition that is capable of exciting its citizens once again , of being relevant in the world once again ...
The next item is the report by Mr C@@ si@@ bi , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the setting of eco@@ design requirements for energy related products ( recast ) - C6 @-@ 02@@ 77 02@@ 77 / 2008 - .
I have heard the President and the Commission talk about their relations with the Council and in particular Ecofin , in its euro dimension , but it would be useful if they could tell us how they believe the European Parliament should participate in the taking of the important budgetary and economic decisions .
However , Mr President , we should take note of who is being pressur@@ ised and who really bears the responsibility for prolonging this process and taking it to a third reading .
We must support these requirements in our legislation on food quality , plant @-@ health health products , seeds and genetic resources .
And there were a few problems .
Within this context , the issue of respect for human rights and democratic principles is essential to this Parliament .
I would in particular like to stress that the Committee on External Affairs has asked - the Commissioner for External Affairs and I had the opportunity to talk about this with Mr Patten last week in Santiago de Chile - that the second Summit of Heads of State or Government of the European Union and Latin America and the new agreements which are being negotiated with Chile and Mercosur be considered as priorities .
For example , we feel bound to express our concern about banana production in certain ACP countries , in the small producing countries of the Caribbean and in certain countries of Western Africa , which have traditionally been suppliers to the banana market and to whom we have commitments that we cannot ignore .
It does so where we feel that offering our hand is better than closing the door .
Mr President , please could I ask you to suspend the voting for a minute , as the Partido Popular &amp; apos ; s voting lists are currently being distributed .
We have therefore deemed it necessary to request the withdrawal of the present text in the hope of achieving a better initiative , which would contribute to the creation of a real Community policy on this issue .
The reasons depend on the importance of these new neighbours , from the Ukraine and Georgia to Belarus , in which the presence of the giant Russia plays a pivotal role .
I will end by once again thanking the rapporteurs for the speed and quality of their work , as well as the whole of the committee and Parliament as a whole for their support for the Erika I and Erika II packages in their entirety .
It is common knowledge that all the new Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 made a commitment to participate in European monetary union .
I believe that it is not enough to simply refer to or reflect on this huge problem . It must be tackled with all our strength because it is a very serious problem and the enemies we are facing are very strong .
Madam President , firstly , please allow me to intervene so that there may be equal treatment amongst all of the groups .
We have received this news but we do not know what impact it will have on the European Union &amp; apos ; s economy .
On the other hand , we need to understand the concerns of those countries that are expecting a possible increase in transport costs and , therefore , a compar@@ atively un@@ favourable situation .
There is good communication on immigration - and I hope that Mr Poettering realises this - underpinned by a consensus on moving forward with a common policy .
I would suggest that it is one of the most important topics , since we are talking about the budget and the budget is what allows us to implement all the Union &amp; apos ; s policies .
The first question that I wish to put to the Commissioner is : does he consider that the simultaneous launch of the enlargement process and the European conference signi@@ fies approximation to the so @-@ called called &amp; quot ; reg@@ at@@ ta theory &amp; apos ; ?
I believe that it has those effects , although there are significant differences in each of the Member States .
Finally , they will have to ensure the prevention of violence in places intended to house asylum seekers , at borders and in residen@@ tial centres .
I mean specific measures , not mere declarations .
We support and applaud the efforts they are making to get there on time and to achieve their goal , but that is a job for the Romanian authorities .
Many quer@@ ies could be raised regarding the proposal for a progress report . However , given the time constraints , I will concentrate on the question that concerns me most as citizen of a southern European country , namely the so @-@ called called decoupling of aid .
I asked him whether the Commission would complement this rhetorical support with any kind of support that did not just consist of words .
B@@ rea@@ king down the barriers to transatlantic economic integration will promote mutual prosperity .
The Commission delegations have seen a dramatic quantitative and qualitative expansion over recent years .
Employment is growing at a good rate .
Mr President , I must say firstly that I am truly perplexed .
And frequently the necessary dialogue is not promoted , not only between political groups , but also between different institutions which are affected and which suffer the effects of terrorism .
Trade and economic relations are part of a broader strategy of consolidating overall relations between the two regions .
What we are trying to do is to assert the Union &amp; apos ; s autonomy .
I therefore congratulate Mr Gallagher on his wonderful and , above all , rapid report , as well as his excellent work .
As some of you have said , the green light must be given to the GALILEO project once and for all .
As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties , I would like to emphasize , in particular , the need to direct our efforts towards the fight against marginalization , racism , xenophobia and drug addic@@ tion .
And this is not only an inter @-@ State State objective , but also a European Community objective .
I am making this request because yesterday in this House Commissioner Vitorino announced two substantial amendments to the initiative , which I believe should be subject to further analysis in committee and , furthermore , this is laid down as an ordinary procedure in the Rule I have mentioned .
We support the Commission &amp; apos ; s approach with regard to the phasing @-@ out out system .
There are many decisions in the workings of the European Union that involve sanctions .
The problem we have in the European Union , Mr President , and this is neither your fault nor that of the Danish Government , is that our system does not work .
F@@ ar more resources are lost through an ineffective and un@@ motivated administration .
It is also true that , even with the stimuli that are being applied , there are risks of a rela@@ p@@ se given the extremely worrying rise in unemployment and the as @-@ yet yet unresolved weaknesses in the financial system .
This kind of consideration is not the responsibility of the Commission .
Turkey , in the strategic position it occupies , is the only truly secular state , and Europe has been founded upon this great battle to achieve secular states .
If the Commission continues to refuse to increase substantially the maximum guaranteed quantity - as I see it does - employment will suffer .
In short , are there any programmes within the strategy papers that do not have a Millennium Development Goals profile , as laid down in the DCI regulation ?
Not only is the unanimity rule being maintained in a few crucial areas , but we also now have three types of qualified majority .
Let us hope that the Convention helps us to resolve this problem which we are all facing .
Today , Mr President , History is being con@@ jug@@ ated in the present tense .
One of the key elements of your reform - the decoupling of subsidies - may have adverse effects if we do not manage to modify it .
I have the impression that today , those most concerned by the environment are accepting , little by little , but more and more , the fact that in order to develop a definite environmental policy , account must be taken of the balance between the cost and effectiveness of the measures proposed .
The European Union requests that the Russian authorities try and punish the people responsible for human rights violations , thereby eliminating any risk of impunity , which unfortunately some people have enjoyed in the past .
The Member States should also take the principle of insularity into account in their fiscal measures .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your highly relevant , correct and complete answer .
I believe that that makes complete sense and we should all support it .
It is now our turn and , fundamentally , the turn of the Council .
All these agreements were for@@ ged , Mr President , on the understanding that if any person physi@@ cally , legally or morally belonging to the European Union was affected , or if the conce@@ ded ann@@ ul@@ ments did not happen or were altered , the European Union reserved the automatic right to re @-@ initiate initiate the normal WTO complaint procedure .
Therefore , Madam President , I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and , when Parliament decides , - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and , next month , the programme for 2000 , which is what we fully agreed upon .
In view of this overall assessment , therefore , and whilst respecting and understanding the reasons of those who will be voting against , many members of the Group of the European United Left will be voting in favour of the conciliation committee &amp; apos ; s joint text .
We now need to work on the basis of these parameters in order to achieve a more solid Economic and Monetary Union that is more efficient internally and projects itself more uniformly to the outside world .
The results of this political action at European level could not be more hear@@ tening .
With this in mind , I should like to emphasize a few aspects which I think are relevant to this discussion :
For this is the way in which the Council of Ministers has proceeded with regard to the how , when and why of this measure .
The European Union &amp; apos ; s Charter of Fundamental Rights states in Article 31 ( 1 ) that every worker has the right to work in conditions which respect his or her health , safety and dignity .
Our group is clearly the majority group and it is destined to continue to be so during the next legislature .
Addi@@ tionally , the proposals that have been put forward are reasonably good and very detailed , and I believe that all sectors involved have recognised this .
It is said for example that the democratic deficit must be overcome by strengthening the national parliaments &amp; apos ; capacity to act within the processes of European construction .
I can tell you that the Commission is willing to accept all the amendments to the common position of 18 February 2002 , since we believe that the amendments tabled do not only improve on the common position , but in many places they help to clarify it .
I am not opposed to the liberalisation of visas for the Western Balkan countries .
The labour market must be another of our main concerns if we wish to make progress on employment .
- Madam President , Commissioner , representatives of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to congratulate the general rapporteur , Mr Mulder , and the rapporteur , Mrs Gi@@ ll , on the excellent work they have done .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , that was the previous speaker &amp; apos ; s last speech , and this is my first in plenary .
Mr President , the European Parliament must be involved .
With regard to enlargement , we must be aware that events in the Balkans have changed the landscape , and in Helsinki we will have to open negotiations with other countries .
This explains my political interest in supporting and defending the resolution .
For it is also the Council , and not just the Member States , that are subject to our scrutiny .
The assessment is frankly positive and we must continue to make progress in accordance with what the Council has told us , at both the Lisbon and the Feira Summits .
The Commission therefore believes that it is much more logical to maintain the system as it is at the moment , with the guarantee that , without any doubt , if any candidate countries have problems , the macrofinancial aid system will be applied to them .
Indeed it is its duty to do so . Nonetheless , if terrorism is to be dealt with effectively , it must be dealt with within the framework of international law .
As I have said , we are dealing with the political result of applying the Treaty of Lisbon and we are also dealing with a transitional and exceptional solution that will only last for the duration of this parliamentary term .
Mr President , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , President of the Commission , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are approaching the debate on the forthcoming European Council in Brussels with a certain amount of optimism .
They have a much smaller share in the labour market than men , a difference that is particularly accentu@@ ated in some countries , especially in southern Europe .
Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Rothe and all the shadow rapporteurs who have participated in the production of the report for their willingness to seek points of agreement .
The challenge of equality is above all the challenge of employment .
Madam President , I ask you to respect the nationalists in this House , who are moderate , peaceful and democratic .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , the Olympic G@@ a@@ mes ought to be perceived by both the Chinese authorities and the rest of the world as a chance for China to change its international image , which has been particularly affected by continuous breaches of human rights , affecting very different groups , for very different reasons .
I therefore believe that the Vienna Summit also offers an opportunity to test the will and determination of the Latin American countries and I hope that this is translated into concrete progress .
We therefore call for the common fisheries policy to be revised , specifically based on these new principles .
If we want to be credible , we need to work together towards this .
This means , therefore , that we must develop a conceptual and analytical de@@ vice that allows us to assess our own instruments .
It has already been said , and I will repeat it , that 191 people have been executed this year and 3@@ 17 people were executed in 2007 . Only China can beat this record .
I believe we should insist on this working approach despite the fact that it is difficult to introduce the credibility and importance of these ideas into the policies of the countries .
I should like to focus on two particular issues in the agenda , because I feel they are particularly important to the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean dialogue .
There are two areas in which a close relationship between our institutions can create trust between our citizens .
The Commission has applied principles of governance fully in its initiatives .
Parliament has been careful to achieve a balance , showing that we realize this is a delicate matter , but we are in favour of retaining a spare parts market open to free competition , where the interests of the manufacturing industry are also safeguarded .
All the Member States of the European Union are now parties to the Rome Statute , and therefore submit to the International Criminal Court .
We therefore need a global , comprehensive approach , using all of the legal tools available to us , raising awareness in the media and ensuring that education systems are taking the problem into account .
That would show them what the European Union is , Mr President .
That has not been the case .
Mr President , I shall attempt to sum up .
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe we have the obligation , as Europeans , to do everything possible to ensure that this process , which will begin following yesterday &amp; apos ; s elections , will be a process which leads to a good result , and so that the initiatives taken do not meet the same fate as previous initiatives , such as the Mitchell report or the Tenet Plan and other important reports which have been adopted but which have not been able to be implemented .
Europe is not doing well , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , it is not doing better than it was six months ago .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to add another important comment , which is that the Charter and the Lisbon Treaty strengthen the Union as a supranational democracy of States and citizens , and that is the first response in an era of political globalisation .
Secondly , there has been a lack of transparency , a lack of participation and a lack of information . And lastly , there is no mechanism for monitoring the environmental and social clauses or the democracy clause .
That is what can be deduced from what we are hearing here in Parliament .
Of those four points , I will comment on the following : the need for reforms within the Palestinian Authority - we all agree on this - and also our complete and u@@ tter condemnation of terrorism .
It is also clear that this is a unique situation .
Second , does the presidency not think that the European Union should hold talks and meetings with both sides , that is , with Morocco and the Polisario Front ?
That is the real question .
With regard to the amendments which were presented at the time on this issue , the Commission is clearly committed to taking a different route , since we have no difficulty with the basic idea .
I shall therefore vote yes , because this is going to be of great help to the whole of the debate on the European working time legislation , which is essential to Europe &amp; quot ; s future .
The Committee on Agriculture &amp; apos ; s position represents no progress in that direction either , and I must say once again that it is unfortunate that an amendment by my group on modifications to the aid was declared inadmissible .
My group has very much appreciated the fact that three experts have been given the task of cle@@ aring the way , but I believe that it would be very positive if the Commission were to make use of that capacity for initiative which is conferred on it by the Treaties - and Parliament - and if we could agree on how to go forward together on all fronts , with a view to the new millennium and above all , and firstly , for the sake of our fellow citizens .
I repeat that we must have a minimum degree of internal coherence in our policies .
So says Ms Ayala , whom I wish to congratulate on her sound and thorough report .
We also mention tax incentives and the inclusion of commercial vehicles . The latter must not be omitted from the proposal given that they are responsible for a significant proportion of carbon dioxide emissions .
I think that that is sufficiently serious for us to do everything that we can to stop it happening .
We are in complete agreement with Mr Barzanti when he emphasi@@ zes the need to strike a fair balance between the protection of copyright and the protection of rights which may reasonably be invoked by consumers ; and we are especially concerned that this balance should be maintained .
We cannot in any way endorse the military solution for the Lib@@ yan crisis or for any other crisis .
Mr President , Argentina is in crisis , and when Argentina cries , the whole of the Amer@@ icas are concerned , as , I believe , Europe is too .
Mr President , any dictatorship leaves behind it a trail of victims , murdered people , tortured people , people who have spent years in prison and many people who have had to go into exi@@ le .
The challenges of enlargement are certainly not limited only to discussions on decision @-@ making making procedures or the distribution of competencies .
Mr President , aid which is conditional on the acquisition of goods or services originating in the donor country has repeatedly been condemned as an immoral and inefficient practice by recipient countries and the worst @-@ affected affected NGOs on the one hand , and on the other by the majority of agencies involved in development issues . Among the latter are many intergovernmental organisations .
However , I also do not want the European Parliament to be used to campaign for the opposition , which , at this point , is using an individual case to damage the credibility of an entire policy , with which it is possible to be more or less in agreement , but which needs to be debated politically at all times .
In addition , the resources needed for the enlargement of the European Union are not guaranteed , and enlargement is now in danger of being postponed .
Taking advantage of the presence of the Commissioner , I should like to urge the Commission to be flexible , since the situation experienced in Spain is ultimately the result of a climate disaster , the kind of event for which this Solidarity Fund was first set up .
Consequently , the Commission has undertaken to use all the instruments at its disposal to address the issue of the exclusion of the Roma minority .
We are dealing with development policy in a pi@@ ece@@ meal way and this prevents us from having an overview .
There are two topical reasons why this treatment and the approval of this report are advisable .
Mr President , our Group is in full agreement with the Pompidou report , which has made a worthy contribution and far @-@ reaching reaching improvements to the Commission &amp; apos ; s communication on R@@ T@@ D cooperation with emerging economies .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this terri@@ fies me , because at the end of the financial year of the 1999 budget - to refer to a Spanish pro@@ ver@@ b - &amp; quot ; not even the rapporteur is going to recognise her own budget &amp; quot ; .
Commissioner , thank you for attending this debate .
That is the purpose of the report I am presenting to this House today .
I believe that we lack rigorous information .
It is truly disappointing , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , to listen to a question from Parliament being answered in this meaningless bureaucratic tone .
Information and communication technologies ( IC@@ T@@ s ) are a key factor for growth at this time of economic recovery , but they are also essential to sustainable growth and the fight against social exclusion .
It is quite understandable that the European Parliament should express its suspicion .
The high level of debt in some countries has , moreover , a deterrent effect on investment , leads to the flight of capital , makes its production become excessively export @-@ orientated orientated causing imbalances , the abandonment of rural areas and even domestic shortages .
Mr President , in fact , in some cases we are providing external support for these countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
Naturally , these measures must be supplemented with active labour market measures in order to assist in job @-@ finding finding .
Mr President , I started off by talking about consensus , and I do not want to finish without returning to the subject .
I now hope the Commission takes account of the significant improvements which the Committee on Fisheries has introduced into its proposal .
Do you not think that it is realistic to think that electric cars will be widespread in Europe by 2015 @-@ 2020 2020 ?
And lastly , I would like to refer to the way that negotiations are carried out .
And I also want to acknowledge this .
This initiative is based on the resolutions of the Organisation of American States and must contribute to a sustainable solution to the crisis .
Having said this , Mr President , this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference .
At a time when we are thinking about harmonising , co@@ dif@@ ying and unifying private law , however , the creation of that parliamentary forum , perhaps with this specific aim for now , would be a good way to begin to send out the message that the European institutions are not dis@@ connected from national legal traditions .
Secondly , I would like you to tell me whether or not it is true that the Treaty on European Union indicates that Ministers of the regional governments can participate in European Councils of Ministers .
It has to be done with the due solem@@ nity accorded to any declaration made in this Chamber .
In my opinion Amendment No 30 establishes a number of basic conditions on respect for human dignity . I think these should apply in all Member States , although some of the latter may wish to take either a stricter or more liberal line on the basis of these common fundamental conditions .
In this respect , I believe that access to preparatory documents would not provide much information .
This is an essential factor in achieving two objectives , that is , a higher employment rate and greater competitiveness throughout the productive structure , where of course the labour dimension is fundamental .
It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for the wonderful work she has done .
It is not going to function with the great trans @-@ ocean ocean forms of transport because of the type of goods transported and the type of ship used .
Mr President , we are in favour of and support the Commission &amp; apos ; s communication on reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation in the southern and eastern Mediterranean .
The Commission must ensure that the socio @-@ economic economic structure of these areas is maintained .
Nevertheless , this should not stop us beli@@ eving that we have an historic shared responsibility with regard to the tragic situation of human rights on the three continents .
We are therefore in favour of negotiation in order to resolve these problems , as we have always been .
The Treaty of Lisbon establishes new institutions : the permanent President of the Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs . It strengthens Parliament , the heart of European democracy , and also strengthens the Commission .
It is now time to look at enlargement .
We should not just punish those who comply with the law and respect the technical measures .
The United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the territorial integrity of Lebanon must be respected and Syria must cooperate in cle@@ aring up the assassin@@ ation of ex @-@ Prime Prime Minister H@@ ari@@ ri . It must also make progress in relation to the abolition of the death penalty , respect for religious minorities , etc .
All of this means , from a legal point of view , that the possible violation of freedoms and rights on the part of a State is the competence of the European institutions .
Along with what I have mentioned , there is a great deal more that has been said .
We repeatedly call for increased participation of women in these jobs , a better balance between men and women , but we still notice a difficulty in achieving the presence of women in decision @-@ making making posts .
Mr President , I am presenting a report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation with regard to information measures relating to the common agricultural policy .
Firstly , because through this agreement the EU is reaffirming its commitment to the ACP countries , and therefore its will to contribute to the sustainable economic and social development of those countries .
I therefore believe , Mr President , that it is positive that we are going to the conference of donors - we must change the current thinking according to which the boo@@ ty is being distributed amongst the friends of the occupiers - and we must be able to respond as the European Union .
I am talking about dealing seriously with the issue of the debts of the countries affected .
Specifically , we must point out that the Chinese Government is making progress in this area and the rights recognised by the International Labour Organisation should also be taken into account , since they are a crucial aspect of human rights .
Nevertheless , we will give the Commission our vote of confidence so that it can give as much detail as possible about the scope of its proposal .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Madam Vice @-@ President President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to join with other honourable Members in expressing my grief at the murder of Professor Bi@@ ag@@ i , and unequivocally condemning terrorism .
I do not see any examination of how we can change the ways that we involve the regions and create networks , whether or not these are EU dominated in attitude .
However , the aid needed now is difficult to get through , despite the efforts of the NGOs , because the roads , bridges and railway lines are damaged .
Our difficulty is simply that we do not know what the proposals are .
I would also like to stress that , when we implement this assistance , we not only insist on establishing a stable economic framework , but also on policies being created that are aimed at achieving economic stability .
We must build Euro @-@ regions regions where citizens find their natural community in a Europe without frontiers .
The first is a message to the Council because , for the first time , in one week there has been a Council of Ministers , on Monday , which adopted a common position ; a meeting of the contact group ; a meeting of the NATO Council of Defence Ministers ; and a meeting of the Council of Europe .
As far as the broad outlines of the candidate &amp; apos ; s programme are concerned , we feel bound to express the anxi@@ eties raised within our group by some of the statements he made today and on 13 April .
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague , Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens , Mr de Ro@@ o , I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me , and I will highlight just two issues .
Mr President , in this joint debate , the Community action programme to promote the integration of refugees - for which Mrs Z@@ im@@ mer@@ mann is rapporteur - has assumed particular importance in view of the current situation .
I am pleased to note that the negotiations within the Security Council appear to be making good and rapid progress towards a substantive and clear resolution on this matter .
So far , we have not seen counterfe@@ its that could technically be called &amp; apos ; counterfeit euros &amp; apos ; .
We might discuss that , but in principle we should be in agreement .
In any event , we must recognise that the regulations and Treaties lay down obligations and that acts of deregulation that may benefit certain companies will cost the Union &amp; apos ; s budget dearly .
I propose that that project be a public discussion of the Bolkestein Directive in front of the television ca@@ meras .
The ball is in the Ministers &amp; apos ; court and we hope that they decide that there is that will .
Therefore , Amendments Nos 16 , 19 , 21 to 26 , 28 , 29 , 32 , 33 and 34 and Amendments Nos 14 , 15 and 18 could be accepted after certain textual changes .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , we have heard the progress report of the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , and now we are entering the home straight .
I would once again like to express my respect and admiration for the excellent technical quality and knowledge you have demonstrated in your cooperation , your work and your amendments .
Furthermore , it must guarantee pluralism in the audiovisual media and acknowledge the fundamental role of public services , in particular broadcasting .
Only a European vision will enable us to confront new challenges such as international terrorism , for which international intergovernmental forums can no longer provide a sufficiently rapid or effective response .
I also support the call for the EU to respect and promote the guarantee of a sustainable future for farmers in the context of trade agreements , and not to put European agricultural production , rural agriculture and global access to food at risk .
As a former union leader , I would like to say that we are pleased that the Social Charter appears in the draft Constitution .
The European Union is determined , and committed to tackling climate change and taking up the challenge of guaranteeing secure , sustainable and competitive energy .
Mr President , allow me to begin by expressing my condolences at the deaths which have taken place .
Within this context , the European Union and its Member States must continue to lead the debate .
I hope that the mid @-@ term term review of this agreement - and of the common fisheries policy itself - will consider and overcome these difficulties , which have nothing to do - I stress - with Greenland , which is offering us its waters .
We have also planned a series of political dialogue meetings at ministerial level , between political leaders , that will enable us to look at our relations in the wider international context .
Apart from examining the many petitions it received , your committee had to deal with the election of the new Community Ombudsman . It successfully performed its duties in that regard , organising hearings of the candidates with meticulous efficiency .
In addition , the European Union must urge the Ma@@ o@@ ist guerrillas to commit themselves to respecting international humanitarian law and to signing a humanitarian and human rights agreement with the governmental security forces .
Mr President , Commissioner , we must be glad about the establishment of this agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile and I also believe it is fair to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Salafranca , on his efforts and the results achieved .
Our seas everywhere are being destroyed and , as we destroy them , we are ru@@ ining the poorest among us who still have to make a living from fishing , such as the inhabitants of the Comoros .
For this reason , although we are aware of the whole range of problems , dangers and possibilities that this accession brings , our group supports these two proposals without reservation .
However , while I understand this in principle , it would create enormous difficulties in terms of managing the project .
Therefore we need to make improvements in that respect as well .
In recent resolutions we have called for the immediate establishment of a human rights office in Colombia , as Mr Kreissl @-@ Dörfler Dörfler said , because that is essential .
C@@ lon@@ ing is a practice which at the present time ought to be restricted to research and experimentation .
Mr President , there has been talk here today of respect and there is no doubt that we have to respect the result of the referendum held in Ireland , in which some people voted &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; and some people voted &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; .
One of these is the reduction in wages which would accompany a reduction in working hours .
Please do not imagine , ladies and gentlemen , that the people involved in the various presidencies , in this case the Swedish Presidency , have not put forward suggestions and ideas for making progress .
We in the European Parliament cannot allow hope to be hijacked yet again .
Mr President , I am very happy to be here today to support the work carried out by the rapporteur , Mr Rothley , and I would like to join Mr Lehne in thanking Mr Rothley for his work .
When a proposal is tabled to strengthen legislation , we must all vote for it .
That was the starting point for our analysis and also the starting point for the report produced by the Commission . It was also the starting point for the Commission communication that I had the honour of presenting to you on 7 May .
Therefore , the mandate received by the Presidency to establish common policies has been carried out .
Accordingly , in its Communication entitled &amp; apos ; Li@@ mi@@ ting global warming to 2 ° c &amp; apos ; adopted this year , the Commission stated that in order to ensure that there is a 50 % chance of not exceeding the 2 ° c limit , it will be necessary to keep greenhouse gas concentrations at substantially less than 5@@ 50@@ ppm CO2 equivalent in the decades ahead . It also stated that emissions must then go down in order to achieve stabilisation at around 4@@ 50@@ ppm .
Mr President , during the last part @-@ session session we held a debate with the Council after 10 Members asked an oral question .
I will end by saying that this report will undoubtedly lay the foundations so that we can create a harmonious framework in the European context in order to encourage the micro @-@ credit credit sector .
Moreover I think that the involvement of Croatia in Her@@ z@@ ego@@ vina and in support for the ban@@ ds of mafi@@ o@@ si and ultra @-@ radical radical fasci@@ sts operating in the region of Her@@ z@@ ego@@ vina will not escape anyone who knows Bosnia .
I agree , but it must not be before the Palestinians want it to happen .
We could never approve or support a directive which discrimin@@ ates against other people &amp; apos ; s cultures in this way .
It is no coincidence that you , Mrs Rothe , a member of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , are chairing this sitting today .
We believe it is important to introduce Article 153 as an additional legal basis in the field of consumer protection and , furthermore , we also believe it is important to point out certain elements in the definitions .
Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , having listened to you , we are afraid that the negotiations are being stalled .
That is our duty , as Europeans who are committed to democracy , freedom and human rights .
I said that there is a second aspect to prior information and that is that ministers should take Community elements into consideration when defining their national policy .
We are aware that there are some Member States , some governments - including the Presidency &amp; apos ; s government : the Spanish Government - that have led the debate on this issue and put some issues on the table .
This directive is , in my opinion , insufficient but it is a first and absolutely essential step which we hope will be followed by other steps which are also absolutely essential in the field of company law .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the current economic and financial crisis that we are experiencing highlights the need for regional policy as the best means of reducing disparities in development between regions and Member States .
Let us anticipate the changes awaiting us and let us create reasonable conditions so that the European industry can deal with the challenges facing it .
We urge the Community &amp; apos ; s institutions to join in with global campaigns on access to water , agriculture , food safety and public services .
It is essential that we see the FTAA project as a counter @-@ offensive offensive by the United States to reduce the European Union &amp; apos ; s influence - which , although in principle it is contradictory , can also be described as beneficial - in relation to Latin America .
Every year an unknown number of people are declared innocent after being executed .
Mr President , this statement and debate were motivated by the reve@@ lation of the existence of the now in@@ famous internal Commission note - or , if you like , note by a Commission official - concerning the disinformation strategy to be pursued with regard to the issue of mad cow disease .
Furthermore , I would like to address the President of the Commission and say that the circumstances in which he finds himself must lead us to reflect on an important issue , which is the role of the Commission .
Europe is constructed on the basis of agreements and consensus .
( Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )
There was an amendment , which I myself withdrew at the Commission and Council &amp; apos ; s demand , concerning the cases where a classification society did not have its headquarters or main office in the European Community .
I believe that that is also important .
The report &amp; apos ; s second objective is to strengthen cooperation in practice .
The resolution calls on European institutions to make a coordinated and strategic contribution to including Europe &amp; apos ; s Roma population .
This is one of the objectives in this proposal for a directive .
I also said in my reply that Slovakia wants to be a member of the euro zone from 1 January 2009 , and at the appropriate time we will have to assess whether or not it meets the conditions .
Mr President , I would like to begin my intervention by welcoming the initiative by the Portuguese Presidency , which has continued - quite rightly , in my opinion - with the French Presidency .
The success must be operational and lasting .
But in order to create European cabotage and for it to genuinely compete with other transport systems , that is land transport , we need efficient port services .
It was only last month , however , that Parliament received the documentation enabling it to begin its work . Furthermore , the documentation was incomplete and did not allow us to work properly .
However , we would also stress the assessment of the attached declaration calling on the Commission to accept certain amendments : some technical measures proposed by the Member States .
Furthermore , this agreement contributes in turn to European economic and social cohesion , since it benefits fleets from regions highly dependent on fishing , peripheral regions and regions with incomes below the Community average .
Secondly , with regard to the upcoming presidential elections , the European Union needs to make all its election observation experience available to Honduras and should prepare to send an EU election observation mission .
We are already trying to do this de facto through the ICCAT meetings , a system which we must extend to all the other RFOs in which the European Union participates , and we hope there will be an increasing number of them .
With regard to the proposals made by Commissioner Patten , the Committee on Foreign Affairs has expressed its strong support on this matter .
Particularly given our own current historical context , there is no possible justification for the use of violence , wherever it may come from .
Mr President , by way of summary I should like to confirm the main objective of the Commission &amp; quot ; s proposal . This is simply to guarantee the highest possible level of safety within an enlarged Europe .
An agreement of a binding nature will demonstrate that disabled people face in their daily lives - as we all know - serious generalised problems which relate both to access difficulties and to bureaucracy and the attitudes of their co @-@ citizens citizens .
Agreement could conce@@ iv@@ ably be reached on the basic ideas which I presented to him , and we will continue to work on it .
That is to say , protein crops also suffer from the consequences of balances of the CAP , and their cultivation could develop more if support for respective production was balanced out .
What I am asking is for common support measures to be put together , and for the solutions not to revol@@ ve around the capacity of each Member State to respond .
First amending the Council &amp; apos ; s proposal in order to give Europol a specific framework for the protection of personal data and , with this in mind , I would like to highlight the need for the Council to adopt the proposal for a framework decision on this as soon as possible .
I believe that it in doing this we must take clear account of the situation and show a degree of flexibility , which the rapporteur acknowledges , simply to listen to the will of the refugees and to prevent them , as a result of their temporarily weak position , from effectively becoming a burden to be transported to where we , completely regardless of their views , decide .
I believe it is work@@ able , though it may be somewhat complicated .
And these thousands of European citizens rightly expect local , national and European administrations to guarantee their fundamental rights .
It is true that the United States have committed themselves to not using typical European designations , but only for wine that they export to third countries .
We must work on what Europe is doing .
In the European Union - especially since many European Union countries suffered very directly from the gas crisis between Russia and the Ukraine at the beginning of 2009 - we place an extremely high value on energy security , and we definitely consider it to be one of the European Union &amp; apos ; s major objectives , an objective that is naturally linked to the major objective of combating climate change .
In contractual matters , the consumer is not in a situation of equality ; normally he is at a disadvantage .
I have abstained in the vote on Resolution concerning Turkey &amp; apos ; s progress report 2009 because I believe that Turkey is playing a very negative role in negotiations between the President of the Republic of Cyprus and the representative of the Turkish @-@ Cy@@ pri@@ ot Cy@@ pri@@ ot community .
I do not believe it is necessary to point out that this directive on the strategic environmental assessment is a key instrument for integrating the environment into policies and for promoting sustainable development in the European Union .
Will there be less bureaucracy and more transparency in this Programme ?
I also think that it will be very positive in terms of helping women to reconcile family and working life .
I therefore believe that all this points to one thing - and it is important to highlight it - , namely , that Europe &amp; apos ; s wealth stems from the differences in the varied cultures which exist in Europe .
In the short and medium term it is necessary to focus on food safety and food sovereignty , crucial to alleviating present @-@ day day hunger . In the longer term , sustainable growth for less @-@ developed developed countries must be promoted .
As the rapporteur said a moment ago , we cannot expect confidence on the part of investors , consumers and , ultimately , the financial markets , if they do not have a specific legal framework in which to operate .
In this case , the Commission cannot include routes which cross third countries in the trans @-@ European European networks , but we are aware of the problem posed by the existence following enlargement of an enclave surrounded by Union territory .
The Stability and Growth Pact is one of the elements that has most demonstrated the need to coordinate our economic policies .
Madam President , it is not my intention to repeat the ideas which have already been expressed here but I shall just point out whether I agree or disagree with what has already been said .
It contains three gi@@ ants : Japan , China and India , which are going to be increasingly important on the international stage .
This means that the European Heritage L@@ ab@@ el should not be the sum of the places selected by the Member States , but rather it should reflect a common European vision .
Well , the Commission of the European Union has called into question and cast doubt upon certain fiscal measures which are designed to promote economic activity and reduce our high level of unemployment , measures which were adopted by the Basque institutions by virtue of their sovereignty and autonomy in this area .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . - Madam President , as the rapporteur Mr Lehne mentioned , this issue has concerned the House for 17 years .
That is precisely what we are requesting for these six European regions : to prevent injustice and marginalisation compared to others who are in the same circumstances .
It is a compromise which I have accepted , although I do not like it , and I would like to make this very clear .
The United States , Mr President , has proposed an ambitious free trade agreement with the countries of the region .
The Union has also supported the initiative of CA@@ RI@@ COM and calls on all the Member States to accept and support it as well .
However , the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal .
We are facing a dilemma : this Parliament , which should occupy a vigilant position , can either promote party positions or promote institutional positions .
In other words , and in all sincerity , this is neither one thing nor the other . Likewise , I must say that , although there was consensus , the comitology procedure , even where subject to scrutiny , is totally inadequate for such a sensitive issue as that of body scanners .
This situation will not come to an end on its own .
This coordination is taking place both in Brussels and in Washington and I believe that it has brought some progress in the process of coordination .
The Committee on Industry , Research and Energy is responsible for research , energy and developing the information society .
Mr President , Commissioner , we have come to the end of this debate on Agenda 2000 , and tomorrow the House will surely approve these regulations , with which I believe we have managed to improve one of the Union &amp; apos ; s fundamental objectives : economic and social cohesion and better territorial cohesion .
I would like to emphasise that the work will of course not be finished in June .
Commissioner , I would like to congratulate you on your speech and the communication that has been made .
The objective of this regulation is very clear : to achieve compliance with what has been agreed within the ICAO , that is to say , that the aircraft landing at our airports genuinely conform to the noise standards of the ICAO .
We could also seek formulae so that we can connect to our own debates .
Perhaps the time has come for the Council to start being politically accountable to the European Parliament , which represents all the Union &amp; apos ; s citizens .
No , Mr President , this is not a good system .
This Parliament must champion the demand for a universal moratorium , if this is not approved now .
At the same time , here in Europe , we need wholehearted support for technological innovation , quality , bran@@ ded products and lifelong learning , as well as implementing regional and social measures .
He also referred to the in @-@ depth depth assessment of ourselves and our role in the world currently under way in the Convention preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference . A number of other issues were mentioned such as the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice and , more directly relevant to the budget , the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation on 1 January .
in writing . - Like the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , I have voted against the motion for a resolution on investing in the development of low @-@ carbon carbon technologies ( SE@@ T Plan ) for a number of reasons ; in particular , because the amendment requesting the deletion of recital I - which was key for us - was accepted ; in that paragraph it was suggested that the sixth European Industrial Initiative on &amp; apos ; Sustainable Nuclear Energy &amp; apos ; should be rena@@ med simply &amp; apos ; Nuclear Energy &amp; apos ; .
Globalisation , however , involves further regulation of economic and trade relations and also , at the same time , new risks .
I consider this to be an example of the lack of coordination that currently exists between the EU and international organisations and a good example of the work that is still to be done .
The Commission will adopt its final position based on its analysis of the respective positions of the Council , according to its prerogatives established in the treaty , and also of Parliament , and based on the debate on the Rapkay report .
We think that the resolutions proposed by the Committee on Development should be approved as it is defended by Mr Castagnède with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Development .
The Commission therefore accepts the amendments - some with modifications to the wording - which clarify the text in this respect .
The existing machinery for transposing rules into Community law needs to be improved in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome its current slugg@@ ishness .
I therefore ask for a debate to be opened on the principle of subsidiarity , in order to analyse the extent to which this often limits the freedom of our citizens .
The Agreement helps to maintain the stability of the sector here and contributes to the development of those countries .
I would like to take this opportunity , Mrs Breyer , to congratulate you most warmly on your work .
However , for those of us who regard ourselves as deeply pro @-@ European European , it is sad to see that this transatlantic relationship is still la@@ den with two items of bal@@ last that previously made it sin@@ k : too much mercanti@@ lism and too much inter@@ govern@@ mentalism .
To this end , since my position and that of my party was clear , public and expressed prior to the vote , I would like to ask you formally that my vote in favour of the Watson report and Amendments Nos 1@@ 17 and 118 be registered , as that is how I would have voted had I been present .
The truth is that the report was presented last year , but it was , in its own words , inadequate and we are waiting for the final report , which means that now , six months from the end of the term established for integration , we do not have a report or any initiatives from the Commission .
In Europe &amp; apos ; s case , it is the desire to build a Union of and for all citizens who want unity , freedom , democracy , justice , equality and solidarity , which are European values that we also consider to be universal .
Turkey is a country which , if it meets the Copenhagen criteria , will be able to enter the Union and must enter the European Union .
This right is recognised by Article II @-@ 71 71 of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe .
As regards the politician , I would like to highlight his sensitivity towards that concept that involves truly bringing Europe closer to the citizens .
We should not use this debate to look after our own national political interests .
To this end , some of the amendments that we presented in committee and which have been included propose greater inclusion of this sector in the trans @-@ European European network programmes .
It is very important that we take equality seriously .
It has been a pleasure to get to know her through the work in the committee . I also want to congratulate Mr Böge , whom I had already had the pleasure of meeting , when he chaired the earlier Committee of Inquiry .
I do think , however , although it may appear to be a contradiction , that the Commission can be congratulated on the results that it has had in recent years , but not on the document .
We have not been free to carry out our work as a delegation charged with investigating the complaints from thousands of citizens against work being funded by the European Union .
With regard to the annual report to be published by the Commission , I believe that it should be made available to all interested parties .
This is a further difficulty in terms of implementing effective policies that tackle the roots of the problem .
Mr President , I have come here to talk about a sector that is being particularly affected by this situation : the fisheries sector .
Ladies and gentlemen , over the next few years , this Parliament will be standing at the crossroads of history .
I would also like to receive more details regarding any up@@ dates on this aspect you mentioned .
Ladies and gentlemen , let us all calm down a little .
I believe that there may be a common interest in incorporating a parliamentary delegation into the debates , and we will have to see how we could articu@@ late it according to what happens in other types of negotiations .
Mr President , in my view the general lines proposed by Commissioner Fischler , which Parliament has now rejected for a number of reasons , were not acceptable .
Nonetheless , I should like to make the same point as Mrs Lulling . I believe that it is a matter of concern that some Member States place so many obstacles in the way of the standardisation of non @-@ discrimination discrimination and equal treatment at European level .
We also show how to finance them and we put forward a discussion on own resources .
Galicia &amp; quot ; s fisheries management system is a model for many others in the world and we cannot allow a document from a Community institution - which is not specifically on fisheries but on safety at sea - to question it with no basis and to accuse us of over@@ using our resources or overfishing .
This is something that must be said with total clarity to the Council : &amp; apos ; Do not make the mistake of going against what this Parliament is going to adopt by a very large majority in Mr Dehaene &amp; apos ; s report &amp; apos ; .
Mas@@ sive imports under inadequate conditions from various areas , including Asia , could ruin the industry &amp; apos ; s opportunities . These imports worry us and I welcome Mrs Gradin &amp; apos ; s specific comment on this matter .
It is to be hoped that in turn , each Member State will allocate the permits that it has been allocated with equally objective criteria to its hau@@ liers .
I have received 6 motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
With regard to defending democracy within the European Union , I welcome the agreement reached yesterday on the Lamfalussy programme on the basis of the von Wogau report .
The Commission which you preside over must commit itself to maintaining employment in the fishing industry , both in the Community fleet and in the processing industry .
Employment and economic and social cohesion in Europe are fundamental political principles of our Union .
Mr President , it is my pleasure to come here , as we do every year , to present the annual report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2009 .
I also have to say that we should listen to what the International Commission for the Conserv@@ ation of Atlantic T@@ unas ( ICCAT ) says since , in 2009 , it adopted more restrictive and stronger management measures in line with the recommendations of the Scientific Committee .
Do you not believe that , as Professor Es@@ posi@@ to points out , if we want democracy in the Middle East or in any part of the world , we cannot go about it by telling people in other countries what that democracy must consist of , how it must be organised and who must lead it ?
I would like to make a final observation , and that is that this proposal , like the others presented to us , is intended to be complied with by all the Member States and that the socio @-@ economic economic conditions , infrastructures , traditions and ways of life vary very widely from one country to another , and this will be even more the case following enlargement .
Thank you very much again , Mr González , Vice @-@ President President of the Commission .
The reality is that we also have to remember that the internal market will shortly be extended towards the East and that , in those circumstances , it will be even more necessary to seek a coordinated approach and position and a degree of harmonisation .
Mr President , we have , of course , already debated in depth all aspects of the agreement with the United States on the treatment of the personal data of passengers travelling to that country from EU territory .
Furthermore , we have agreed to launch the Galileo Programme , which will have not only a clear effect on the development of European transport and communications , but also has a major technological component .
I am most grateful to the Commission for its attitude prior to the Intergovernmental Conference and , I note from your words , Mr Commissioner , after the Conference as well .
We have always said - we will continue to say it and , fortunately , this has been the case - that this debate should take place within the United Nations .
However , I would also like to express certain concerns with regard to the economic restrictions .
This text is the result of an agreement .
Indeed , we are fortunate in receiving certain allowances enabling us to engage assistants . Should something really urgent arise , an assi@@ stant can pass us a note and we can then deal with the matter .
I believe that this is a serious mistake and that it would not just send an inappropriate message about the European Union &amp; apos ; s double standards when assessing human rights in the world , but also about our institutional inconsistency , since we should remember that the European Parliament recently adopted a resolution that expressed quite the opposite point of view .
I think that it is right to recognise that under the mandate of Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner Waldner , the European Union is a world leader in election observation thanks to its methodology and to the credibility of the work that it is doing .
So I request this ad@@ journ@@ ment under Rule 1@@ 31 of our Rules of Procedure .
And we are prepared to support it because he was very flexible in the debate and discussion on his draft report and accepted all the amendments tabled by the various groups .
This is without doubt one of the most serious problems faced both by societies in the less developed countries and by our societies , which we consider to be democratic and to comply with a genuine rule of law .
For this , I believe we must thank Chris Patten for his cooperation and particularly for his intelligence .
I believe that Community law will soon be developed by Member States and that this matter will thus be dealt with without many difficulties .
The Commission drew up a proposal which was debated by the Committee on Agriculture and approved by a wide majority in this Parliament last December .
I therefore ask the Commission to remain receptive and promote any mutually beneficial fishing cooperation initiative which may arise in the future .
Mr President , like the other groups in Parliament , my group has followed with great emotion the agreement signed in Bel@@ fast on 10 April by the British and Irish Governments and the parties representing the communities of Northern Ireland .
Allow me , then , to begin with some thoughts which are directed at the Commission .
I would also like to highlight the amendment we are presenting today to Parliament on behalf of our group , the PPE @-@ DE DE , which will give the Member States greater flexibility in the application of their recovery plans .
I will finish by thanking the officials of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their dedication and professional attitude , and also by expressing my thanks to the Commission and the Council , who have supported us by showing interest and understanding .
Another matter I wish to deal with does not relate to the present directive , but indirectly affects the application of mix@@ tures .
Likewise it is important to assess their effects and ensure their compatibility with European strategy , to learn from financial upheavals and to regulate the accounting standards of administrative concessions in a balanced way .
Mr President , that would be a worthy gesture , and I request it of you before the House .
I have a substantive matter to put to the Commissioner .
Another very important matter is the considerable humanitarian aid provided by the European Union .
Mr President , I am going to talk about two concepts , namely coordination and flexibility .
Firstly , can we treat the Member States of the European Union un@@ equally ?
Firstly , the need for clear and comprehensive labelling .
We would therefore like to ask the Presidency of the Council to take immediate action , since the information we have from Mal@@ ab@@ o , from the day before yesterday , is - as Carlos Carnero pointed out - extremely worrying .
I believe , Mr President , that that message should be made absolutely clear to the Conference .
The adverse effect that North American backing for him has had on those desires must be neutrali@@ sed by another influence , a positive influence in favour of human rights and full democratic progress , coming from the European Union .
Specifically , the delays being caused by Member States between detection and reporting are also leading to difficult situations .
We must learn quickly , create new practices more suited to the new society and invest in technological change , but we must never forget the people or the institutions .
I have asked a question because I previously consulted a series of decisions taken by the Council of Ministers in 1997 on certain guidelines for fisheries agreements and , as far as I can see , they have not yet been complied with in the European Union .
For example , human tragedies are being produced on an almost daily basis in the South of Spain , in which the victims are North African migrants trying to enter Europe who sadly die in the attempt .
Whatever happens , they should always show full respect for human rights .
Above all , however , I want to point out three or four amendments to Mr Fischler that are of particular importance .
I can say that - and I congratulate you on this - you successfully led a dynamic work team to achieve the best possible results .
I think the answer is fairly clear here too , at least it was to us .
Mr President , this report is a result of an agreement between the Italian Government and the European Commission to restructure the Italian fleet which uses drift nets .
When compared with the agricultural sector as a whole , the final beneficiary &amp; quot ; s sum may seem small . Nonetheless , 40 % is a large sli@@ ce of the budget , and minor errors cannot be overlooked .
When the European Union is accused of being a bureaucratic organisation with no soul , people forget that its soul is our Charter of Fundamental Rights .
By moving forward together we can achieve much more ambitious goals , the likes of which others responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions are not prepared to undertake , at the end @-@ of of @-@ year year Conference on the post @-@ Kyoto Kyoto era , and Europe will find itself alone in making such commitments .
Seven@@ thly , it requires education and teaching against violence in the population .
The possibility of giving an explanation was raised , and I argued that that would mean a new vote .
Perhaps , Commissioner , it is also time for the Commission , the Council and for all of us to reflect on Europe because not everything is resolved here , either .
P@@ recau@@ tions are set to guarantee the transparency of the procedure , with respect for all principles of Community law .
We believe that the current situation cannot continue and we are therefore prepared to support the European Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal on the open coordination method as a step forward on the common policy .
As a result , alongside the Commission , we are aiming and endeavouring to protect fishery resources .
Some of them may appear appropriate ; what is unacceptable is that they should be funded with resources earmarked for development cooperation .
And this responsibility has to take the form of concrete proposals and not of vague references to a White Paper or other such matters .
Re@@ as@@ ons for this include the realistic consideration that this will enable us to achieve short @-@ term term environmental goals by establishing specific reduction levels , and timetables for fulfilment .
The Convention was a success and the Intergovernmental Conference is a failure .
I believe that , for the fruit and vegetables sector , this report proposes a pioneering form of crisis management that other sectors will have to copy in the future .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is a problem which not only affects the Basques or even all Spaniards .
The European Union must act as one on this .
Mr Lam@@ ber@@ ts , I imp@@ lore you to keep it brief , let us see if you can en@@ lighten your colleague with your point of view in just thirty seconds , shall we ?
It is therefore an extremely important programme .
This Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Women &amp; apos ; s Rights and Equal Opportunities has been working very intensively on all these issues .
It is not reasonable for public funding to compete with private funding when it comes to financing risk capital projects , and we should use that public funding for those types of project which are most difficult to finance through the private sector .
In the report which she presented in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy there were many points on which we were in agreement , but Mrs Cor@@ be@@ y wanted to go further and , after having reached a compromise , at the last minute she has introduced modifications in Amendments Nos 26 and 27 which have obliged me not to sign them and to vote against them tomorrow .
Thirdly , enlargement is a challenge in terms of combating different forms of organised crime , such as terrorism , human trafficking or drug trafficking .
A minority in the Council wanted the opt @-@ out out , which was temporary in 1993 , to become permanent and , with Parliament &amp; apos ; s vote , to be forever , leaving the hope and dignity in this battle to us .
I think that she has done a magnificent job and also that she has shown imagination , calm and a capacity to reach agreements and compromises in order to present a document to this Parliament and to the Commission which I think can be useful and effective .
Furthermore , enlargements increase Europe &amp; apos ; s role in the world .
Madam President , I would like firstly to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for the efforts and imagination it has applied to trying to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives in the European Council .
I have no wish to call into question the good intentions of the majority in the House , which wishes to introduce the new procedure of a suspended and conditional vote of censure .
In fact , other amending budgets are presented in this Parliament without any debate , even when the financial sum involved is greater .
I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contributions and their willingness .
The United States Senate is already tackling these issues and we need to tackle them here too ; they are issues that affect responsibility and sustainability .
Nevertheless , the issue has been on the table in the European Commission since the 1990s and so far nobody has decided to deal with it .
Mr President , I would first like to congratulate the Danish Government on taking the initiative to propose the Council framework decision that we are discussing , which aims to equip us with more effective tools for combating serious environmental crime .
This is therefore the first example of co @-@ funding funding of market measures which , as my fellow Member has said , could lead to imbalances in the market , distortions of competition , a conce@@ aled renationalisation of the common agricultural policy , and this could lead to very bad results for everybody , including those who are sceptical about the common agricultural policy , because renationalisation would lead to much more of the protectionism which they believe is already too much .
The availability of such funding has diminished as a result of the crisis .
I believe that the European Union must adopt a vigorous stance vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis the United States , and must not enter into negotiations on the Helms @-@ Burton Burton Act , but affirm that act is illegal .
Madam President , please allow me firstly , as a Spaniard , to thank all the honourable Members who have expressed their solidarity .
I voted against this European Parliament legislative resolution , because creating the service that they want to finance represents another step towards the militarisation of the European Union &amp; apos ; s foreign policy .
I am pleased that two weeks ago , in Luxembourg , the Ministers of the Eurogroup adopted a similar position and supported this proposal .
It is cause for satisfaction that this issue has been included as a priority for 2003 and we hope that it yields positive results .
If we are mean , however , this vol@@ can@@ o could do more damage to the European economy than is being forecast .
Can the Presidency elaborate on what exactly its plans are in this area and when we can expect such initiatives to be put in place ?
Whatever happens , it is my belief that it will take a good deal of work and time before the new arri@@ v@@ als achieve the standard of those leaving us now .
We call for support for the amendments we have presented so that specific treatment is given to peripheral areas - Sweden , Finland , Portugal , Italy , Spain , etc . - so that we are not left out of the market .
Mr President , in a process of transition towards a new world order charac@@ terized by uni@@ polar attitudes and globalization , unfortunately the European Union is still not up to it .
The crux of the matter lies in knowing how far we want to go in recognizing people who are different - ethnic , cultural and religious minorities .
The EU Solidarity Fund was created in order to demonstrate the European Union &amp; apos ; s solidarity with the populations of regions devastated by disasters .
The people and governments have made tremendous efforts in the last years of convergence .
The European Union brings together the majority of the world &amp; quot ; s installed capacity .
I thought that the excellent French Presidency would also improve this aspect of facing up to the consequences .
I understand that there is agreement on this issue .
It is essential that we guarantee support for this type of source for a considerable period , thereby allowing our industry to make decisive and long @-@ term term investments in this energy alternative .
Such statements give the impression that very few people have actually read the agreement that they are criticising , since having read it , there is no way they could have come up with some of these arguments .
It is true - and some of you have said so - that , with regard to relations with the Court of Auditors , there is a problem of primary legislation which will clearly have to be amended , if the European Investment Bank is receive the same treatment as the Community institutions .
And this democra@@ tising effect also impacts on national parliaments .
The Union also needs a common approach to legal and home affairs . The European search and arrest warrant will be an essential element of this but by no means the only one .
Allow me to repeat what I said earlier : the average European expects the Union to find a way of meeting our expectations . It is not merely a case of balancing income and expenditure .
We must enhance our relations , while maintaining a critical spirit , and explore new opportunities for greater joint and coordinated action at international level and greater integration of our markets , which will benefit our citizens .
They hope to see evidence that , for the European Commission and especially the Council , the priority and the most urgent matter at the moment is to come to a sound agreement with Morocco .
We will vote in accordance with these considerations .
I must also say that in some countries there are worrying political consequences because not all regions are equal and not all territories have political power .
I would like him to give us some clarification .
It distur@@ bs our relations with Russia and creates a situation which encourages those States which are on the threshold of having a nuclear capability to start again .
Moreover , I believe that in the Council , the rules of the game have been changed , but my government will deal with that .
It is time to speed up the adoption of the necessary measures in order to implement the European Parliament resolution .
We must , however , move forward in any event , and Parliament accepts this dis@@ order and wishes to cooperate , despite external and internal difficulties , as demonstrated , for example , by the fact that all the groups in committee have agreed to remove all references in the proposed directive to subordin@@ ating conditions for acceptance or medical treatment at the different stages of the procedure .
It must be very well controlled by the services of the European Commission that are on the ground , so that it may reach the people genuinely affected .
If one day - and we hope it never comes - someone takes an initiative which means a real cut@@ back in Category 2 , then that person should know that the European Parliament will be against it .
Furthermore , on the proposal of the Commission , Ecofin yesterday approved certain very important conclusions which indicate the improvements that are being made to the European statistical system and , in particular , to fiscal statistics .
If the Council restricts itself to condemning the disproportionate nature of Israeli military action in Gaza , why does it not use that hac@@ k@@ ne@@ yed euphe@@ mism when referring to the Palestinians ?
However , I would like to add one point .
We must therefore prevent any more rap@@ es of women and children , we must prevent pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hi@@ lia and we must stop European money being used , via the United Nations , for the purposes of committing sexual crimes .
And I also hope , Mr President , that the Council will maintain the excellent cooperation that it has enjoyed with this Parliament , with the exception of recent times .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has included in its report some of the conclusions of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
I believe that in these circumstances , the debate we are having today would be radically different .
Strengthening economies means strengthening the Member States - those that are open to the rules of the market , but without putting citizens solely at the service of those who are more capable of applying them .
Ladies and gentlemen , representatives of Europe &amp; apos ; s citizens , we are not alar@@ mists , and to an even lesser degree are we Euro@@ sceptics .
Europe alone , as we said in our January proposals , must move forward in setting ambitious objectives . It will not be possible , however , to make the kind of commitments we wish to unless the other participants at the Conference do likewise .
It appears that the Commission has interpreted these opinions according to criteria which are no doubt very well intentioned , but which can at best be described as hasty , in light of the audience which took place in the Environment Committee with the scientists responsible for the opinions .
Today , a degree of progress has been made in terms of effectiveness , but unanimity is still a very significant burden .
Mr President , illegal immigration has become one of the European Union &amp; quot ; s major challenges .
Nevertheless , I would point out to the Commission that , as far as the Socialist Group is concerned , there has been a change of priorities .
Parliament will take part in the negotiation of the subsequent long @-@ term term agreement .
All of the points made by Mr Man@@ zella in that respect are totally relevant .
I also wish to point out that , for the moment , everyone , except for Saddam Hussein , has acted with the utmost respect for international law .
I am sorry to hear you are so unhappy , Mrs Izquierdo , but I thought it appropriate to use those four and a half minutes to fill in the background to the situation . Though you were well aware of it , other Members of the House may not have been .
As far as the Treaty of Nice is concerned , we can say very little , because we do not yet have the conclusions of the European Council , and therefore , until we see them , we cannot add much .
One of the objectives of the negotiation of a common transatlantic air space is precisely to resolve , by common agreement with the United States , the current situation caused by the unilateral actions of the different countries which have signed up to these agreements .
Madam President , the objective of the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal today is to update Community Regulations ( EEC ) Nos 1408 / 71 and 5@@ 74 / 72 in order to take account of the evolution of national legislations , to clarify the legal situation with regard to certain articles of these regulations and to take account of the recent judgments of the Court of Justice .
That is not much , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , but at least it is a start .
Secondly , it has a will which is reflected in budgetary terms , which will allow the European Union to go to Madrid with respectable sums within the 2002 budget .
I believe that we should welcome this willingness to participate , which increases transparency and communication .
That is something that we forget too often .
We must be able to share and to accept our collective responsibility .
It will be better for everyone to share the responsibility .
In our view , this type of policy runs counter to the quest for a stable and secure international order .
I would ask the Commissioner to deal with this issue , so that it may be possible to promote complementarity between the INTERREG programme and the MEDA programme , because otherwise , Morocco will not have the financial means intended for cooperation .
Nonetheless , we would like to emphasise that we are appreci@@ ative of the support we have again received for our position regarding the Community &amp; quot ; s competence to include the principle of criminal sanctions in the implementation of Community policy .
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on con@@ tain@@ ers lost at sea and compensation by Bri@@ an Simpson , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism - B7 @-@ 04@@ 69 04@@ 69 / 2010 ) .
However , he made us some political commitments which I would like to remind you of in your capacity as President @-@ designate designate .
It is to be hoped that when it comes to adopting the new decisions on framework programme budgetary allocations , Parliament will support the allocation of additional resources to research into aquaculture .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m .
In this respect , I would like to refer to the codification of Community law .
What are our views about what should be done on the Union &amp; apos ; s list of economic objectives ?
What plan is proposed for addressing the extremely complex problems faced by the region ?
That , ladies and gentlemen , is essentially the content of the amendment that we in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy are proposing to Mr Eurlings &amp; quot ; s report .
I would say that this is a really trivial issue , a few comments by a politician on a television programme , which have resulted in a criminal action that has no grounds , and which are covered by the Portuguese constitution and by application of Community rules on the waiver of parliamentary immunity .
Mr President , I would like to ask the Commissioner if this explanation - which was very reasonable and balanced - has been adequately conveyed to the Council .
I believe that it has also been positive to confront the need for a common asylum policy , but we need the funding to sustain it .
As we know , beyond the ethical issues concerning the commer@@ ciali@@ sation and patentability of life and natural heritage , the release of GMOs into the environment is irreversible and difficult to control , and can have direct consequences for the contamination of conventional agriculture and the reduction of biodiversity .
It is an excellent report - for which we congratulate the rapporteur - which provides a balanced reflection of the various interests and agreements involved .
I would therefore like to emphasise everything the Commissioner has just said on this point .
We can discuss the percentage , but we think that it is important that it be implemented .
Mr President , in the Spanish state , fundamental rights are being violated by terrorist killings , extor@@ tion , threats and violence .
The problems and challenges inherent in the integration of financial markets must be addressed in a broader context , which is what Mr Goebbels has sought to achieve in his report and what we in the Commission are seeking to achieve in the study that the Li@@ è@@ ge Ecofin meeting asked us to produce on how we can respond to the challenges of globalisation , which we are intending to present next February .
I would therefore like Members to be aware that all of this will be carefully safeguarded and that , furthermore , the Council &amp; apos ; s report provides a basis for clearly resolving this problem .
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that we are talking about risks which do not exist .
Madam President , we have given a great deal of consideration to this motion for a resolution currently under debate and , in all sincerity , find the greater part of the motion very reasonable .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Lisi , the rapporteur , on his excellent work and , in particular , on the very constructive compromise amendments he has proposed on some of the most controversial issues , which I hope will allow us to achieve a positive result in the conciliation procedure .
The ratification procedures are following their normal course , although it is a long process , and we can expect that , if nothing un@@ toward happens , all the Member States will have ratified the Cotonou Agreement before the end of this year , 2002 .
This is an excellent report and the rapporteur must be congratulated on it .
Now we have , as has been said , the opportunity to act , and we need the will to act .
Their presence reminds us that , in May of last year , the fifth enlargement of the European Union was left incomplete while we waited for Romania and Bulgaria to complete their accession processes .
Neither the Spanish authorities nor the European authorities nor the regional authorities have much say in the matter .
The Direc@@ tors @-@ General General will have responsibility for the internal control of their direc@@ torates @-@ general general , without in any way exemp@@ ting the respective Commissioners from their own political responsibility with regard to the functioning of the services and that includes , where appropriate , the President of the Commission .
The issue of abuse must not be exaggerated .
Mr President , I believe there have been many statements here condemning the recent comments of the Israeli Government and recent events .
We could look for some political leaders to advise us .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , ten years after German reunification , which marked the end of the cold war and to which our institution actively contributed , we find ourselves at a new crossroads .
On 30 January 2003 , the Commission adopted two proposals for directives relating to a Community strategy and standards on the safety of nuclear power stations and the treatment of waste .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , we are getting increasingly close to what we asked for at the beginning of the legislature , that is , an annual political programme presented to Parliament with the participation of the Council - and I hope that Minister Haarder &amp; apos ; s presence here is not superfluous and that he can also participate by responding to our comments , in line with visibility , transparency and democratic control .
Mr President , Commissioner , subsidiarity and proportionality are binding rules of a constitutional nature which regulate the exercise of competencies shared between the Community and the Member States .
Mr President , the Commission has come before the House once again accompanied by the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , as it does every year . We are here to discuss the priorities for economic , social and environmental policy to be dealt with at the Spring Summit .
In my view , the draft resolution of the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development must be seen as a document of minimums , which should provide the basis for the negotiations within the Council of Ministers of the European Union .
This would clearly indicate this Parliament &amp; apos ; s goodwill in relation to moving ahead with this reform with the Commission .
As you know , at the Copenhagen Summit an agreement was reached on relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance .
I would like to make two further comments .
All of this has to be done thinking of the European citizen .
Finally , I would like to note that at the moment it faces its first challenge of visibility , of history , with the proposal for a Mediterranean Union made by Mr Sarkozy .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President President of the Commission , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my support , on my own behalf and on behalf of the Spanish Socialists , for the Corbett @-@ Méndez Méndez de Vigo report , which marks the end of an historic process .
If we want to avoid the risk of total humanitarian crisis , we must exert pressure in order to ensure that that force gets there as soon as possible .
This reflects the political sensitivity of the matter , in particular where relations with third countries are involved . It is used to support the argument that the Council should have the right to exercise implementing powers in this area .
It should also be said that the committee and the European Ombudsman had a constructive relationship based on constant dialogue and mutual respect for each other &amp; apos ; s competences and prerogatives , and two reports were presented .
The Stability and Growth Pact , however , as modified in the Communication in November , introduces an additional element in relation to this policy so that it may further promote development in Europe .
Mr President , I should like to begin by reiterating the importance of this debate and of the piece of legislation that has brought us together today , because we have spoken so often of these matters that we sometimes run the risk of losing sight of how important the issues really are .
My group and I would like to show our support for the Commission and we maintain that action has to continue that will really express and guarantee this right of Europeans .
We must therefore strengthen the pact , the framework for budgetary surveillance and our instruments for economic governance .
I say this sincerely to you , from my long experience in se@@ ar@@ ching for consensus .
The Belgian Presidency has been excellent .
In my opinion , it should be the frontispiece of a future Constitution , but at the moment , what we could do and what could easily be achieved in Nice , is to include the Charter in the Treaty by means of an extremely simple link : Article 6 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on European Union .
Mr President , this is a serious and rigorous report .
In my opinion , ladies and gentlemen , it means a major step forward , historically speaking , in the process of integration and in building the most essential notion of the European idea of human dignity which , as we said before , responds to the demands of the European public .
But in view of the gravity of the events and their impact on the health of Europeans , the completion of the internal market and the proper functioning of the democratic institutions of Europe , 71 Members of this Parliament have tabled a motion of censure .
It is difficult for passengers to accept being denied boarding .
As for monetary stabili@@ zation , as you well know the Commission does not have financial powers , and unfortunately the euro still does not exist .
Firstly , I feel that efforts must be made to understand Serbia &amp; apos ; s position and to send out a message of respect to Serbia , one of respect for its history , its present and its future .
I must say that , in my opinion , the text approved in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection met these requirements .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission firstly wishes to thank Parliament , and in particular Mrs Haug , for your understanding and the common approval of the Council .
Only with a European approach , a European vision and European instruments can we deliver results for our European citizens .
When we speak of European languages , let us not forget that this does not only mean the official languages of the Member States .
In my opinion , the European Parliament report should diffuse the tension rather than increase it , because if diplomatic channels are exha@@ usted , it will aggravate the already complicated situation for the people of Iran .
The Commission has been arguing that all tax reductions must respond to certain criteria , which are contained in your report , and which we believe are essential to maintaining the idea of quality of public finances .
Mr President , I would like to thank the general rapporteur for the budget , Mr Costa Neves , for the efforts he has made to achieve a balanced and reasonable budget which respects the competences and prerogatives of this Parliament .
We all know that we have made very serious commitments and that we must make the necessary efforts to ensure that these are not just stated ambitions but also tangible realities .
Their economic integration is a positive reference point for building an open , reliable and globally sustainable economy .
We therefore fervently hope that we can count on your help , your dialogue and that we can work together constructively over the coming months .
It can be found in the Treaties . Nowadays , we refer to territorial cohesion as well as to economic and social cohesion .
This responsibility is shared by us all , the only condition being that the candidates must fulfil the political criteria expressed at Copenhagen , of a stable political order , respect for human rights and protection for minorities .
In other words , the rule of law which is today in place throughout this great Europe .
Mr President , in view of the present circumstances , I wonder whether it is worth visiting the country at this time .
It is quite a sad matter for the European Union that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which there is no cooperation agreement .
I also consider it absolutely essential to establish a series of measures aimed at ending Israeli military oppression , which is causing countless casu@@ alties , most of whom are civilians .
It is not bad news although certain aspects do concern us .
The question is how we can help to break the current ag@@ oni@@ zing and dramatic deadlock in the peace process .
Do you believe that we are going to be able to deal with the challenges facing the European Union with less resources ?
The concern expressed in my report is for a clear distinction to be made between simple guidelines issued by administrative institutions and the legislative process .
Special attention is therefore being devoted to this issue .
Let us hope that the European Union gives its full support .
Are we going to have a common position of the Council in this matter ?
I must repeat that I do not understand why we do not do so .
What is desirable is for all the players , all those that are part of the global economy , and in particular , the exchange markets , to keep to the guidelines that we agreed in the G@@ 7 , in the International Monetary Fund , in the multilateral consultations , that took place a year ago now , in order to try to deal with the global imbalances in the economy .
Within the complexity and magnitude of the EU &amp; apos ; s external relations , the space occupied by dialogue and human rights consultations with third countries could go unnoticed or remain in the background .
I would say simply , in summary , that this World Summit has served to promote much more intensive action within the European institutions and also , obviously , to stimulate debate before the next World Summit takes place and to assess the issues raised here .
He has also noted that the negotiation of this agreement was not conducted very well , or well enough .
the report by Mrs L@@ ich@@ ten@@ ber@@ ger , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on the 2@@ 6th Annual Report on Monitoring the Ap@@ plication of European Union Law ( 2008 ) - .
I urge Mrs Morgan to request that the report be referred back to the committee .
What I have just said with regard to Parliament , Mr President , is equally valid for the Commission .
Restric@@ ting the sum , as the rapporteur does in her compromise amendment , seems more reasonable and , above all , more effective in terms of defending this strategy .
The European Union has taken very significant steps in these negotiations , more so than others .
We must now apply the Treaty , as interpreted by the Court of Justice .
In any case , the possible existence of this agreement , of which we are completely unaware , would by no means prevent Member States from having to carry out their obligations in accordance with international law and humanitarian law .
We now have a series of measures in place : monitoring by the Council , on the one hand , and guidance from the European Council , on the other . The result has been an improvement , with the European Central Bank understan@@ da@@ bly acting to ensure bank liquidity , first and foremost , and access to loans by companies .
This option would allow cohesion to be preserved within the Union and would permit a fairer distribution of the financial effort required to maintain this level of cohesion .
But all of this , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , should take into account an essential element : we should not forget what the European Community has meant over all these years nor the thing which is most important to the Community , which is the principle of integration .
So far , the Commission has approved the Regulations on SMEs , training and minimums , and now it is proposing a Regulation on employment aid .
It must not therefore be used by the Council as a bargaining chip to obtain strategic positions which have nothing to do with the actual political process of enlarging Europe .
This is a further step by the European Union in the fight against terrorism .
It is difficult to implement trade defence mechanisms in response to external pressures , as we have found , but it is not impossible .
I therefore believe that we must welcome the Council &amp; apos ; s commitment to approve a package of measures at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 6 and 7 December .
Furthermore , and in order that this policy may be truly effective , information on actions implemented by the Commission must reach the smaller entrepreneurs , a sector which very much needs it .
It is also clear that this revived dialogue requires a broader agenda providing for a whole series of issues to be taken into account . I have in mind challenges to governance , conflict prevention and important issues relating to democratisation and the defence of human rights .
With regard to the Constitution , I must point out that more than half of the European citizens and 60 % of the euro zone have approved it and I cannot understand why the positive vote by 75 % of Spanish citizens is worth less than the negative vote by 66 % of the Dutch .
Mr President , at this stage it is obvious that this parliamentary initiative is born out of a general sense of concern in this House about the slowness , and even paralysis in some areas , in implementing agreements reached within the framework of the Barcelona Conference , almost four years ago .
I should now like to focus on two specific aspects of the guidelines for the budget for 2000 .
It seeks to update the 1996 Regulation with regard to the Union &amp; apos ; s commitments on security of supply , climate change and renewable energies following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
We cannot therefore support any amendment aimed at bl@@ ur@@ ring or doing away with the distinction established so clearly in the Council &amp; apos ; s text .
As a former Member of this and other parliaments , I understand the importance and the implications of the Statute for Members and of the report presented to us today by Mr Rothley .
This is therefore the vision that I can give you on relations with Russia .
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital .
The decisions adopted for the supplementary budget are correct and are a step in the right direction .
Any additional cut would be extremely negative and would mean giving up many of the policies being called for .
S@@ imply , a new Community vision of nuclear security and the treatment of radioactive waste .
The same is true with regard to immigration policy .
Whilst on the one hand we recall how reports , financed mainly by Americans , were falsi@@ fied during this period to show that climate change did not exist , in the same way that any sci@@ enti@@ st who insisted on the problems that climate change could cause , was discredi@@ ted , it is also true to say that public awareness has greatly increased over these ten years . In other words , we may have wasted time in implementing measures , but the level of public awareness is higher than ever before .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think it is very positive that we are talking about the Mediterranean today , the southern border of the European Union , and that we can hold a debate specifically on transport in the Mediterranean .
Changes in the legal bases are also recorded , notably concerning matters covered under the old Article 43 - agriculture - and which now come under the title covering public health .
I believe we should also stress , as the President has done , the progress that has been made on maritime safety , particularly in view of Greece &amp; apos ; s role as the main European power .
With regard to the liberalisation of planting rights , I believe that it must be carried out prudently and at all times under the supervision and control of the Member States .
We know that the terrorists observe us , we know that they are innovative and try to change their methods to ev@@ ade our strategies in the fight against terrorism .
I also want to state , however , that we cannot and must not be satisfied with this . Let me reiterate that the Council and I are fully committed to pursuing the investigation of this matter through to the end .
I am not of course just talking about prevention through war .
Madam President , Commissioners , the recent situation concerning Russia and Ukraine and the gas supply has clearly shown that more than ever before we need to diversify our supply and improve connec@@ tions between Member States and with producer countries .
Only if the European Parliament receives a satisfactory response setting out in detail the reasons for which the Commission has not decided to take proceedings , will it be possible for the European Parliament to accept the way in which the system works .
However , they can also help the EU &amp; apos ; s technological development and enable us to export clean technologies to other parts of the world .
The Treaty of Lisbon , which makes the European Union more democratic and more effective , is bringing in new elements , such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and new instruments , such as the citizens &amp; apos ; initiative .
I believe that we will have to carry on talking a lot over the coming months in our committee in order to find genuinely European compromise formulae .
This policy also includes a requirement of proper use .
Mr President , I would like to know whether perhaps the question I put to the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council does not deserve a reply , as I have not heard his reply .
Finally , paragraph 39 is also incorrect .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to highlight once again the importance of the Mediterranean policy for the European Union .
It is a new right in that the European Community is at present playing a vanguard role .
First of all we must assess the need to take action and , after that , actually take action .
The Socialist Group welcomes the stated intent of meeting the Kyoto commitments .
Mr President , in order to be effective , all of this legislation , this modification , this updating of the legislation , requires other measures .
Report by Mrs Thyssen ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 77 00@@ 77 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the draft guidelines on vertical res@@ tra@@ ints &amp; # 91 ; C5 @-@ 00@@ 0@@ 9 00@@ 0@@ 9 / 2000 - 2000 / 2003 ( COS ) &amp; # 93 ;
We will not be able to tell citizens that it is necessary to address the challenges of globalisation , that it is necessary to be more competitive and that the operation of our markets must improve , if our policies do not respond to a greater degree of social inclusion which is also provided for by more competitive and more productive economies .
Having said this , I wish the Commission great success in this debate and I hope that the management model , which has been a failure , can be changed in the future .
At the moment , the two clauses contradict each other , which is why we are proposing that they be removed .
Some passenger interests are so important that we must give them protection under the law .
We also need to do something about trade .
The Commission should pursue this objective and approach during the extra year for which the plans will be extended .
Would you please kindly tell me which Rule of the Rules of Procedure your point of order relates to .
Moreover , we must have a coherent external policy to ensure the compatibility of trade objectives and development aid so that less @-@ developed developed countries can export their products and do not have to export their own nationals .
This , however , was not possible and despite the good will of the European institutions , the problem of reaching the agreements that were supposed to have been the minimum basis for solving the serious problems we have in this world was not solved .
This is not a trivial issue .
On behalf of the workers , I would ask you to communicate this concern to the relevant committee .
Cas@@ es such as that of Joaquín José Martínez lead us to be more optimistic about the influence of the European institutions and , in particular , our Parliament .
I am not only referring to freedom of speech as we politicians defend it , but also to freedom of speech for all citizens and also for workers in the press and the media , because it does not make sense for us always to advocate greater democracy for workers in other sectors but not in this one .
I believe that this is an issue that the Napolitano report has also highlighted and to which we should give our full attention .
If action is not taken immediately , the producers of Community salmon will suffer such heavy losses that many will be ruined .
So it is important for this Parliament to be kept informed , to be consulted and to state its opinion , in order to guarantee democratic responsibility .
This is not the first time we have discussed this issue in Parliament , of course .
Finally , ladies and gentlemen , there are important reasons that we need to take into account : we are currently dependent on imports for 75 % of our vegetable protein needs .
Cri@@ me goes beyond borders , and our police forces , which are national , need to have in Europol an instrument to support and strengthen them .
Mr President , the tripartite interinstitutional dialogue - Council , Commission , Parliament - is the essence of the Community institutions &amp; apos ; origin@@ ality .
We must wait for its culmination with the decisions in June , but I am convinced that , by welcoming Greece into the euro when the time is right , we will generate more confidence in the face of any other type of arguments against the future progress of the single currency .
This objective is applicable to institutions at all levels , local , national and international , and furthermore it is necessary for the public administrations , whatever their institutional level , to promote and support the reuse of the information provided .
In order to do this , we need to promote sustainable water use , protection of available water resources and their efficient and sustainable use .
Apart from that , I repeat , I want to join in congratulating the Commission and the Commissioner , Mr Patten .
And I regret that Parliament has not fulfilled its obligation , because what we have to do on first reading is budget in the way we want .
The delay , among other things , has meant that the MEDA programme has developed slowly .
Mr President , I would to thank all the Members who have spoken in the debate and point out that there is largely a broad consensus on our approach to this issue .
The only difference of opinion is over how best to achieve this goal .
There are the well @-@ known known methods of budgetary discipline and structural reforms in order to maintain competitiveness .
I agree with them that our main concern must be attention to and clear information for patients .
Unfortunately , the reality of immigration requires global , coherent and coordinated initiatives and not one @-@ off off actions , like this one , which is limited to implementing Article 26 of the Schengen Agreement .
We believe that industry - and on this I am certain that I am in agreement with the Vice @-@ President President of the Commission , because we recently spoke about this matter and he agrees with us - is and must be an irre@@ place@@ able driving force behind growth and recovery for the European economy .
To insist on it would imply an excessive interest in sending messages in favour of a certain action , which cannot be shared by important sectors , both in Parliament and in European society .
Mr Hughes , who is not present at the moment , made a useful incidental observation on how the European Union can also play a major role in effective dialogue in the event of conflict .
Finally , the Council also focused its attention on matters involving education and technological research , development , and innovation , factors which should be a major part of Europe &amp; apos ; s competitive advantage .
The US Administration is denying them and their families their legitimate rights as defined in the most fundamental rules of international humanitarian law .
We need to keep on working , we need to keep driving gender equality policies forward .
And , consequently , all of the measures agreed upon by the Council will be implemented jointly by the Council and the Commission .
The rigi@@ di@@ ties of the Regulation have also contributed to this and now , by means of this modification promoted by the European Parliament , they are going to be eliminated .
I hope that justice will give them the victory that history , ham@@ pe@@ red by crime , denied them .
I am speaking simply to propose a minor modification to the amendment , in the name of legal rigour .
Mr President , when the Council adopted its common position in September , it was a bad day for social dialogue .
Yesterday , Commissioner , I read something that did make me happy ; it seems that , following the Brussels Council , the Commission is explor@@ ing new forms of modulation .
It does not take into account , as has already been said , the strategic significance for European livestock bre@@ eding of being dependent on imports from third countries for the supply of vegetable proteins , and of the fact that those imports consist almost exclusively of genetically modified food .
But I have decided to take the floor because we run the risk of exaggerating the complaints , and an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes go down in history as if they were the opinion of the Parliament .
During the negotiations , Europe has kept moving forward .
The fact that some governments do not wish to finance the fight against unemployment or reconversion activity cannot lead to an a priori reduction in these funds .
The only solution is for us to support Ju@@ li@@ us N@@ ye@@ re@@ re , African leaders and the O@@ A@@ U in their efforts at finding a solution to the grave crisis aff@@ lic@@ ting Burundi and the entire Great La@@ kes region .
However , as well as this short @-@ term term work that is being done by the Member States and the European institutions , we need to look beyond this decade and ensure the sustainability of our social model , the European social model .
If I may , I would like to add to what has been said by all my fellow Members in favour of a charter or of a common approach to this policy by giving you a very brief summary of ten aspects that I feel are key in this respect .
I was surprised by the statements by your Foreign Minister threatening to take a stick to the candidate countries if they do not behave properly .
I do not want cohesion policy to overlook the specific needs of the social groups with the most difficulties , as that is not compatible with an integrated approach or with a more strategic concept that is investing in the sectors of the future .
This is the only way that we will be able to ensure that equal opportunities become a reality for European women in the countryside .
As for the social chapter , I think that we must act .
I hope we will be practical and that this formula will be applied in the debate next week in Bar@@ i .
Certain amendments do not therefore seem acceptable , such as Amendments Nos 1 , 11 , 15 and 19 .
But questions need to be put to the Commission , and some suggestions may also be in order .
Mr President , I believe that this sitting is of particular importance .
That is why we believe that Parliament &amp; apos ; s amendments improve the text .
They are happening on a daily basis .
Ma@@ inly , however , what is essential is a form of vigilance that ensures total compliance with current legislation , which often appears to be nothing more than a useless piece of paper and as such , cannot serve the purposes for which it was intended .
This year once again , therefore , we must call for actions , for commitment , and above all we must demand that promises be kept .
Commissioner , at this decisive point for the European Union , prior to enlargement , the Member States , with the support of the Commission , will have to achieve greater efficiency in the application of the Structural Funds with the cooperation of the regions and local groups they are destined for .
That is precisely what this Parliament is seeking too .
This government is taking great steps to produce legislation on and to put some kind of order into this issue of adoption which , I might add , is extraordinarily sensitive inasmuch as it affects the whole of Romanian society .
I think this is what the European people are asking of all of us .
As a supporting argument , I should like to mention a fundamental issue .
But we must not forget that this report is in the context of a serious disaster , namely that affecting the Gulf of Mexico .
Mr President , Commissioner Damanaki , Commissioner De Gucht , thank you for being here at this debate on a very important report on the import arrangements .
You may ask whether this is contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Maastricht , but it is clearly not a point which we can debate at the moment .
This requires the creation of a dynamic of growth which guarantees , for the whole of the European Union , an average annual rate of growth of 3 % at least .
Another important point is the creation of an integrated system of management of external borders .
The European Union - the Austrian Presidency has already commen@@ ted along these lines - should not sign any more agreements in the region unless they include the clause on the repatriation of illegal immigrants , which in my opinion will be of considerable help in resolving this problem .
Mr President , it only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for his work and say that I am sorry we have so little time to deal with such an important matter .
We have already re @-@ established established calm debate in Parliament .
To tell the truth , it was not supported by the majority of States in the European Union .
Let &amp; apos ; s join the real world .
We cannot crimin@@ alise immigration , whether it is for economic or political reasons .
We signed an interim nine @-@ month month agreement which should be ratified in this Chamber : an interim agreement lasting nine months , during which this Parliament , the Council and the Commission should establish a new negotiation process to set out a definitive agreement .
It is essentially a legal requirement based on the rules of legality laid down by the World Trade Organisation .
Mr President , I will end by urging the need for the European Asylum Support Office and the aid that may be granted through the European Refugee Fund .
By accepting the greatest number possible of such amendments , I am thereby seeking the greatest consistency possible in terms of what we are voting today , since we will thereby avoid Parliament &amp; apos ; s occupying a weak position , which would not help this matter in any way .
Due to a lack of time , I am not going to give examples .
If so , how much money have these programmes been granted ?
The Commissioner knows that very well , which is why I am not presenting this as a complaint , but just asking for her help and collaboration .
Thanks to the three institutions , therefore , the Commission has the necessary political support to continue moving forward .
This global debate once again places the European Parliament at the forefront of the fight against terrorism .
I will summarise the three that seem most important to me for the future of the European Union .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Laschet , for the work he has done .
We are not discussing economic aid today , but I would like to mention on this point that we believe that this economic support should be utilised correctly and not be directed towards super@@ structure projects which may , at the end of the day , have a negative effect on competition .
We need to revise the competences of the European Union upwards , rejecting any kind of re @-@ nation@@ alisation nation@@ alisation , weakening or curta@@ il@@ ment of those which already exist .
This is because , obviously , these things do not exist in national parliaments or at national level , so people do not understand why an agreement has to be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to implement what the treaties say .
I believe that the European Union must manage and improve this relationship , and promote cross @-@ border border cooperation between the Balkan countries , as a method for preparing them for their future integration into the European Union .
By that , I mean I am totally in agreement with the rapporteur that it is necessary , as a priority , to train teachers to be able to give cla@@ sses in new technologies .
I would like to repeat this request , given the importance of this report , and ask that the vote be taken in Brussels .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted that , after more than a year and a half in Parliament , Mr Seppänen &amp; quot ; s report is finally being voted on in plenary .
At present there are many pilot schemes which the European Commission might use to empower these areas in their proposals and use them as a model .
Another issue which remains in the air is the quest for greater efficiency in our actions by means of selecting more suitable interlocutors with whom to implement our actions .
It is appropriate that we should hear the opinion of the rapporteur , Mr Crowley .
We would hope to see these three objections resolved when it comes to the vote , although I appreciate that the rapporteur himself is willing to accept some of these points .
We believe that the combination of specific actions at all levels - European Union , national , regional and local authorities - is an absolute necessity .
Some amendments , such as Nos 1 and 18 , deal with questions that basically concern the United Kingdom , and it must be said that all the groups from the United Kingdom , whether socialist , popular or green , have supported them vehemently and they have been approved in the Committee on the Environment .
Develo@@ ped countries also assume the obligation of promoting trade within the terms of the agreements adopted in the World Trade Organisation , which are generally considered to be the main driving force behind all economic activity .
Nevertheless , non @-@ legislative legislative measures are being adopted , particularly by means of the Euro @-@ N@@ CAP N@@ CAP programme , with which , as you know , car manufac@@ tures are associated , to persuade those manufacturers to indicate which restraint systems are suitable for their vehicles .
I said that we are constructing , on the bases and principles of our legal systems in democratic States governed by the rule of law , a democratic Europe governed by the rule of law .
We therefore support the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s Amendment 8 , and once again I sincerely congratulate her on the excellent work she has done .
The way to do that is to create a genuine European security and defence identity , based on new foundations and adapted to the current situation .
These countries must be integrated into the common foreign and security policy and they must be able to participate in programmes such as Socrates or Le@@ on@@ ardo , in order to bring their integration into the European Union closer .
With this reservation , I repeat , the Commission accepts the spirit of Amendment No 1 .
How can you talk about regional cooperation programmes with third countries when the democrats of Tunisia and Libya are seeing us closing our countries &amp; apos ; borders ?
Small industries need to be helped to understand how they fit into the potential of the single market , and how they can benefit from a single currency .
Or has the time come to take a greater leap , to play a much more courageous role , if that is possible , but one which leads much more quickly to a definitive solution ?
And , above all , we in Parliament would stress the lack of a genuine crisis management mechanism .
We have asked the Commissioner for more than sympathy .
If we had a scale , we would be very surprised to see the ranking of countries that do not respect human rights .
Fisheries research is also vital when drawing up recommendations and providing scientific advice to legislators .
It is a document that is largely based on a consensus , which is unexpected in an environmental policy that it could be said is going to generate a new European policy and is opening up a new path .
Everything points in the direction of determined and united European action .
The European Parliament has already come out in favour of the Cohesion Fund , as did the European Commission when it considered the matter . However , Parliament is against cofinancing of the CAP .
The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the integration of the objectives of equality into Community policies and , especially in Article 14@@ 1 , positive actions in the field of employment .
However , I should like to conclude on a positive note .
We believe that the general approach which is being applied and proposed to be satisfactory .
We feel encouraged in our commitment by the fact that the ratifications that have already been registered and those that will take place in the very near future are from States on all continents , predominantly European , African and Latin American States so far , with different legal systems and levels of economic and social development .
There can be no obstacles to the application of the law in the European Union .
I believe that the executive Commission has so far acted responsibly and transparently within the framework of its competences .
If I could summarise this debate in just one point , I would say , Commissioner , that Parliament is using these reports to call for the negotiating directives to be revised .
Area of freedom , but the freedoms , the guarantees for citizens are practically un@@ heard of .
Moreover , the political situation in the Sahara warrants further consideration .
The Member States must from now on synchron@@ ise their growth rates . In short , more jobs and more SMEs need to be created .
Solidarity and integration must be the two fundamental corner@@ stones of our immigration policy .
In relation to each of these issues , on the proposal of my colleague Mr Michel , the Commission has recently proposed specific actions , which I believe Lou@@ is Michel has had the opportunity to debate in this Parliament .
The Commission is fully aware of the environmental problems in the Al@@ p@@ ine corridors , but points out that it must act in a balanced way in order to take account of the different interests at play in this kind of situation .
If that relationship comes to be proven , it would significantly change what we might call the Middle Eastern landscape .
This is a proposal which fits in which the concept of shared responsibility and developing an essentially successful market which still requires a few pro@@ ps up front in order to adjust fully to the rules of competition , a board based on cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in the form of the regulatory bodies .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , the first thing I want to do is congratulate Mr Izquierdo Collado on his report on the triennial report on economic and social cohesion .
I am pleased that we will have an opportunity to discuss the EU &amp; apos ; s response at the General Affairs Council next week .
The current crisis has revealed a lack of supervision and economic governance in the financial markets .
I should repeat once again that the Council must show signs of political will , without which it will be very difficult to make the principle of complementarity a reality .
This tax has been thought up entirely from a continental point of view and would in fact genuinely restrict the traffic between the continental areas of the European Union and the regions and countries of an island nature , particularly outlying ones or those furthest from the centre of the European Union .
We want the balance represented by the text of the Constitutional Treaty .
. - The Commission understands that the honourable Member is referring to an issue which is before the Court of Justice relating , amongst other things , to the conditions applicable to the crew laid down in Greek legislation for ships which carry out cabotage services .
In a country where a universal principle such as that of non retro@@ activity is not respected , where the judicial authorities do not respond to any appeals unless the President tells them to , there is no rule of law and there is no separation of powers .
We also think that there is a clear lack of will in the Member States to promote the objective of equality in the Structural Funds .
For this reason , for example , we respect the dates of all these agreements that the Commission and the Council are to conclude with other European countries .
This scheme must therefore be financed by the Community so that it can be applied uniformly .
I would like to point out that there are more than a hundred Euro@@ regions in Europe and that , in fact , through the impetus of INTERREG , the Community initiative which is right now going also to become an objective , they are of particular interest .
This is an act adopted by the United Nations Security Council that the signatory States and the European Union - as representative regional power in some cases of signatory States - should support , but in which it cannot participate .
However , how are you going to speed up this standardisation in order to prevent this issue from delaying the introduction of electric cars in the European Union ?
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Hen@@ nic@@ ot @-@ Sch@@ o@@ ep@@ ges Sch@@ o@@ ep@@ ges for her work on this report .
The President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council has referred to the fight against terrorism and it is clear that when freedom was attacked with the barbarity of 11 September it was perfectly demonstrated that in today &amp; apos ; s globalised landscape concepts of security , defence , diplomacy , trade , culture and religion are all interrelated and that this should be translated into a common awareness that , since the phenomenon of terrorism affects all of us equally , there must be a response that comes from all of us equally .
It is the preventive part that we are concerned with now .
We have often been a little mean in the granting of staffing increases but it is also true that sometimes we do not allow the institutions to function totally efficiently through a lack of personnel .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are attending this debate on budgets at this late hour more than anything else in order to accompany the general rapporteur , Mr Mulder , so that he may feel accompanied and supported by the political groups in this House , with a view to the conciliation which is going to take place on 16 July .
We also know that this crisis has been very expensive .
The key aspect of the report is based on the belief that it will not be possible to construct a democratic Europe unless its citizens are recognised not only as being the direct beneficiaries of the integration process , but also - and perhaps , fundamentally - as subjects who actively help to formulate common objectives .
There are two matters that still need to be dealt with : the regulation of the systemic bodies , and contributions and taxes on banking .
Comp@@ ani@@ es will be free to adopt codes of conduct , but they cannot be free when it comes to respecting the codes of conduct that they have adopted .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , first I should like to say that I support , as does my Group , the decision which has been taken to postpone Croatia &amp; apos ; s admission to the Council of Europe .
To conclude , Mr President , I think that on the one hand , the European Union is in decline , in economic terms , and on the other , it is strengthened by the presence of the High Representative .
We must continue to make progress and today we are going to debate a fundamental element in the mechanism to combat and prevent the pollution caused by ships , namely the system of sanctions for pollution offences for which a part of the directive establishes a framework , and then there is the instrument in the criminal field .
The situation of women with family responsibilities , combined with the difficulties in the labour market , have led to a term which is explicit as well as unfair : the feminisation of poverty .
Thanks to that report , we are able to hold an extremely interesting debate , because once again it emphasises something that I and many people here present consider to be absolutely crucial in the Union , particularly over recent years : at last , we are becoming aware of the impact on island regions of their island characteristics .
I think that the Parliament should therefore send its condolences and condemn acts such as this one .
Mr President , I will try to speak about both issues .
However , the problem of the social and cultural integration of the Roma ethnic minority has yet to be resolved .
Is the Commission also prepared to be more flexible on some matters such as REACH and its implementation , which is going to cause extraordinary damage to our own competitiveness ?
We will see what we do , but you are well aware that what you have adopted does not provide de@@ gressive proportionality .
( The sitting was suspended at 11 : 0@@ 5 pending voting time and resumed at 11 : 30 )
The European Parliament is thereby giving its opinion on the Gallagher report on this agreement , which is essential to the European Union , in record time .
I would add something more : for the first time there is a minister in Ecofin who proposes a debate on the viability of an international tax on speculation .
The proposed decentralisation could cause problems when it comes to precisely determining which costs can be subsidised with Community funds .
Minister , I do not understand the British Presidency &amp; quot ; s concern about multiple contracts .
Particularly in difficult times , it is more important than ever that we manage migration flows intelligently and generously , but responsibly .
Though we are not asking for a complete commitment to this Fund , we are asking that it at least be studied and that it can be taken into account in the Summit &amp; quot ; s conclusions .
Lastly , Madam President , in the middle of this dramatic crisis , it is cause for hope that there are Israeli and Palestinian voices which have the civic and political courage to sign a joint manif@@ esto .
That would be a bad sign for the Intergovernmental Conference and for the future of the European Union .
More in @-@ depth depth consideration would in my opinion bring us to the conclusion that we need to allocate more to the trans @-@ European European networks , precisely in order to favour the creation of infrastructures that will benefit the Community .
I would like to express our concern about the grave situation which has arisen in view of the Laeken Summit , because , by supporting the report by Mrs Reding , of the PPE @-@ DE DE , and the report by Mr Watson , a Liberal , which was widely supported by the European Parliament , this House has defined a clear approach in the fight against terrorism .
We would like to reform these provisions here .
But I have the impression that the procedure which is being tried here is not going to lead anywhere , because I do not see how the Commission , at any point , is going to be able to invoke non @-@ compliance compliance with a Community directive in the past on the part of the State in order to call them to account .
Another issue is that of full convergence between the report by the think tan@@ k &amp; apos ; s task force and Parliament &amp; apos ; s point of view , with regard to the need to carefully study the situation of competition on a world scale and to adopt appropriate measures , especially with regard to launch p@@ ads .
Mr President , my colleague Lu@@ ig@@ i Fl@@ orio was to speak as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &amp; apos ; Rights but as he is not here , I shall speak instead .
These deficits inevitably mean that governments have less room for manoeuvre in terms of their budgetary policies .
The second observation relates to the idea that MEPs should be paid from the budgets of their respective States .
I therefore believe that today we in Parliament should remember the measures she proposed at the time with the support of the European Parliament , which the Council did not support .
And of course , we also must condemn the hypocrisy of some Member States which , breaking the code of conduct for exporting arms to countries that could use them in the way that Turkey did in this particular case , export arms there .
My group is in favour , as are all the others I suppose , of this issue - which is already included in relation to maritime safety in the relevant committee of Parliament - being examined with the greatest possible urgency .
This is not being done for two fundamental reasons .
The reform plan that was presented to us was moving in the right direction , but it fell short in its proposals .
Since we are undergoing a co @-@ decision decision procedure , we all have the opportunity to carry on correcting the deficiencies which may be contrary to the objective of being sure that this new proposal for a directive may pass the test of a further hearing before the Court of Justice , which will undoubtedly take place , because in the field of tobacco there are always hearings before the Court of Justice .
The logistical operation is of great importance , and we should try to resolve the majority of the problems before that date arrives so that these possible second level and less important practical problems do not clou@@ d the fundamental issue , that is the introduction of euro notes and coins .
I believe that we have made quite a considerable effort , and I think that this is a significant step forward as a starting point . We are sure that the Commission will be capable of using the new powers that the Council and Parliament has granted to it .
Our neighbours must also be capable of carrying out significant reforms in order to deal with their problems .
But we must be aware that Eurocontrol does not have the capacities offered by the Community method to carry out its activities .
If we are to provide an adequate response , we must make progress on integration .
We will always support the defence of life and the most fundamental rights and we will always be against murderers and those who justify and support them .
Mr President , I do not believe I can improvis@@ e a five @-@ minute minute speech on budgetary affairs .
We also run the risk of failing to comply with our international obligations within the two regional fisheries organisations operating in the Mediterranean .
I am also very pleased they have decided to pay a visit to the European Parliament during our part @-@ session session .
We could have chosen to pose the question in reverse , that is to say , why , when the Commission had the monopoly on initiative for ten years , did it not take any step to regulate such an important issue ? However , we are taking a constructive view .
The Commission can rest assured that I have an entirely constructive approach towards the object of achieving a final result in relation to this .
Mr President of the Commission , you have done this recently - and I thank you for being here today - by adopting the appropriate measures and repro@@ ac@@ hing those countries which are on the point of exceeding the criteria established in Maastricht in the field of deficit .
That is the reason why Amendments Nos 2 and 4 , which seek to reduce that requirement by establishing that the third a@@ x@@ le is only obligatory in the case of bus@@ es of more than thirteen and a half or even 15 metres , are not acceptable to the Commission .
We shall see what happens in January and February .
If the euro is to bring greater freedom to individuals and companies and increased rationality in their decision making , they must previously have become familiar with the new system .
Secondly , Mr President , the European Union is irrevo@@ cab@@ ly and unquestionably committed to human rights and it has to be very firm when defending those positions .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Schmit and Mr Michel for their speeches , which I found to be notable fundamentally for their level of commitment .
We call on the Commission to make sure that any framework directive on renewable energy includes measures to promote heating and co@@ oling by means of renewable energy , which are the least developed technologies so far .
I entirely agree with the aspects of Mr Lipietz &amp; quot ; s report providing a favourable assessment of the European Central Bank &amp; quot ; s reaction during 2003 : low interest rates , clarification of the concept of stability and enlargement of the eurozone .
Mr Berenguer F@@ us@@ ter said that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market reflected the views of the Members of Parliament .
This is not the aim of this proposal and , therefore , cannot be accepted and we reject it .
I think that this is a relevant political fact , because the Czech President will hold the Presidency for the first half of next year .
We had a situation that was completely lacking in balance between progress in the field of security and progress in the field of freedom and justice .
Our messages are as follows : Yes to enlargement , which is the appropriate response to the challenge of building Europe at this decisive moment in its history .
Congratulations , Mr Chichester , and I hope that you will continue to work with the same rigour .
I also wish briefly to add that I fully concur with what Mr Caudron has said about the launch , as soon as possible , of the ITER initiative , as well as other initiatives .
The Commission should continue its efforts to ensure compliance by Member States in their reporting obligations with a view to providing reliable and comparable data and making a distinction between irregularities and fraud .
In brief : one and a half million people are suffering from hunger in the region , not to mention the long @-@ term term consequences for sustainable development and the climate .
If we are unaware of the challenges and the work which is yet to be done it will be difficult for us to make head@@ way on equality issues .
The application of twenty @-@ five five different taxes on companies creates obstacles to cross @-@ border border activities , reduces the efficiency of companies , over @-@ burden@@ ing burden@@ ing them with greater costs , and causes many fiscal problems for the Member States , as well as greater complexity in the fight against fraud and tax evasion , dealing with double taxation and relations between groups with a presence in different Member States .
Meanwhile , we have to negotiate a framework agreement which forms a solid basis for the improvement of our institutional relationships , with measures relating to transparency and information , such as obtaining the working documents of the Council , the Minutes of the meetings of the College of Commissioners , except when confidentiality has been agreed , or an information system on the work of OLAF which would take into account the necessary discretion .
Mr President , Commissioner , all those present here today seem to agree that the products under discussion are of significant social importance .
The resolution - the draft recommendation - states quite clearly that the conditions have yet to be met : there must be very clear progress in a number of areas .
Having said this , what we need , year after year , is a specific and broad awareness campaign to bring the European project closer to citizens and to gradually raise awareness of the institutions and how they operate .
For them as well , since services affect all economic sectors and this is a crucial issue for the European Union .
Amendment No 5@@ 99 , in line 18 0@@ 6 04 02 , is accepted with an increase of EUR 2 million , rather than EUR 1 million .
Allow me , therefore , to draw the attention of all politicians and institutions to this situation , since we have a great responsibility in this field .
With regard to Annex I , I think that , finally , the proposal from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , which has been succes@@ sively extended with compromise amendments , is correct and should be adopted by this House .
Therefore , we regret very much that the Member States , in the Ecofin Council in February , if my memory serves me correctly , did not support the Commission proposal with regard to the concern for the development of the Portuguese and German economies and the administration of their respective budgets .
Furthermore , it is clear that the current balance between obligations and resources means the Court of Auditors is at risk of being unable to continue to meet its commitments effectively .
I should just like to say that we have taken very good note , because naturally that is part of the exercise : the Presidency has taken good note of everything the honourable Members have said ; I cannot say I agree with everyone , but I have ga@@ thered some very important points .
The reform of the rules introduced as a result of the decision made by this House in plenary at the end of the last parliamentary term changed this situation with regard to the interparliamentary delegations and the delegations in joint parliamentary committees .
I am confident that next year the time scales will be longer and we will all be able to work much more effectively and the opinions of Parliament will undoubtedly be taken into account .
Finally , neither must we forget that somehow we must promote the pre @-@ accession accession strategy with Turkey .
For this , we need Europe to have a genuine commitment to human rights ; an effective , credible and coherent commitment .
Effective , proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are laid down , in accordance with national legislation - of course - in the event of infringement .
But it is such a cautious step and above all so unclear that some of us are concerned about it .
To this end , in 1992 and 1993 , the Regulation and the directive which we are discussing today were adopted .
S@@ el@@ f @-@ government government may be one of the most efficient ways of tackling these problems .
Madam President , I should like to tell the Commissioner that the regulation has been greatly improved , as Mr Val@@ verde has already said .
It remains to be seen how this matter is going to be dealt with in the United Nations General Assembly .
In fact , this Parliament has previously expressed its full support for the Galileo programme , taking on legislative and budgetary commitments and clearly acknowledging that Galileo is a strategic project , one of the pillars of the Lisbon Strategy , which in turn offers great opportunities to our small and medium @-@ sized sized businesses .
In my view , we can no longer put off establishing a framework agreement with the entire European car industry and a code of conduct with the multinational companies , basically so as to guarantee jobs .
We need to take a decision on energy supply in transport , we cannot delay any further beginning our work to reduce our dependency on oil .
Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field . In fact , we are aware that these are already happening widely .
The European Union cannot wait for there to be a change in the international rules ; it needs to act now , to lead the change , to promote green audits of ship dismantling and create a fund with the industry to internalise the environmental costs and also to help the communities in the South , that have already suffered a great deal from the environmental and health costs of this problem .
In the end , there is a considerable possibility that the option that has the most support and the most justification will become a definitive part of Community legislation .
As has already been said , there is anxiety and uncertainty .
Let us trust that they enter into force within more reasonable timescales .
How can we help renewable energy ?
Provi@@ ded this happens , we are in favour of applying Community regulations , of the Commission investigating this , of giving a technical opinion and duly deciding whether it is realistically possible to commen@@ ce negotiations regarding accession through the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria .
Unless you ask me to provide further information , Mr President , I would prefer not to dwell on the issue of enlargement , since today a substantive debate is going to be held on the matter .
I fully share your position and believe that it is crucial to strengthen the voice and human dimension of the Union .
Why not use the leeway provided by the increase in productivity to reduce working hours ? And why not consider other economic solutions ?
Above all , this must also contribute to making our governments think in a more European way when facing crises .
I would like to affirm and confirm the Commission &amp; apos ; s total support for the new text presented by Parliament .
From the point of view of regional policy , the European Parliament has stated quite clearly that the Union should set aside a minimum of 0.@@ 46 % of Community GDP for cohesion policies . It must be set at this level if we wish to have sufficient critical mass available to reduce regional disparities at a satisfactory pace , as highlighted in both the tri@@ annual report and the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union .
Thank you , Mr President , for giving me the opportunity to speak on this item regarding the situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus .
In spite of the exceptions which still exist , the duration of the Union &amp; apos ; s legislative procedures is quite reasonable , generally speaking , particularly if we compare it to national procedures .
In Madrid we must , therefore , strengthen interinstitutional political dialogue in order to ensure a climate of trust and achieve suitable relations .
The reason that I am speaking is purely to support and highlight , if possible , essential elements expressed by the rapporteur of this report , our colleague Char@@ lo@@ t@@ te Cederschiöld , whom I congratulate for her rigorous and excellent work .
The Israeli Government must understand that it cannot ignore the clear views expressed by the international community .
That is why Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Fisheries came out unanimously in favour of the urgent procedure .
We have poo@@ led our sovereignty to face common challenges .
Mr President , it sad@@ den@@ s me very much that we have to hold this debate on violence against women , since it means that we are talking about an active , live issue .
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler , and given that we have heard contradictory comments , depending on the translation , with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler , I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House .
With regard more specifically to tariffs for textile products , the Commission &amp; apos ; s document talks about negotiating new reductions which are as close as possible to zero , a proposal I totally agree with , provided that this does not mean - and I hope the Commissioner will clarify this - that the European Union will be obliged to reduce its tariffs , while others have not achieved an equivalent level for theirs .
Since the armed conflict bro@@ ke out three years ago , the appeals from the humanitarian agencies have become increasingly desperate .
Commissioner Fischler , I am glad that you have increased your flow of information .
Mr President , anyone who reads the newspapers today will find out two things : that we are at a crucial point in the sovereign debt crisis , and that the European response is a succession of isolated provisions with no internal consistency .
Reform should not further penalise those Member States who have less premium units - whether these be for suc@@ kler co@@ ws or male bo@@ vin@@ es - and these reforms are on top of the age limits established for obtaining premiums for sheep .
Mr President , the latest United Nations report on human development defines poverty as a denial of the choices and opportunities to lead a tolerable life .
The outermost regions bring Atlantic , American and African dimensions to Europe , which enrich our cultural , political and economic diversity , of which we are all rightly proud .
The Commission has sent a communication , which is a programme , a sort of timetable for what is going to be done .
This means that there will be grey areas and overla@@ ps in the budget , because I am sure that everyone thinks that cohesion and agricultural policy should be included in the 2020 strategy . This will involve tensions between the Member States and will involve , as it has done up to now , unofficial proposals that appear suddenly , are criticised , and are then hidden away and not mentioned again .
Pa@@ pu@@ a New Guinea is thus becoming a major platform for the processing and export of tuna from the European industry &amp; apos ; s major competitors : the Philippines , Thailand , China and the United States .
They are sometimes very significant mistakes , to the detriment of some of these countries .
As the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Mr Z@@ al@@ m , has said , last weekend in the Hague , both in the Eurogroup of 12 and around the table of the extended Eurogroup - the informal Ecofin of 25 - we held an initial debate on this issue .
It is not just a case of legislating for the Sta@@ ff Regulations of the Of@@ fici@@ als of the Community ; it is also a matter of constructing a working model for economic and social rights and for promoting systems which constitute an expression of equality of treatment , and the end of all legal forms of discrimination based on sexuality .
For this reason , the Commission considers that the proposal presented , and which it expects Parliament to approve , are useful and we are therefore going to support them before the Council , which will take the final decision , and we hope that it will accept the fundamental elements of it .
Furthermore , in the event that it were possible to include rules on additional funding in this Regulation , those rules would not invali@@ date the superior Community rules on state aid which are still applicable .
Mr President , I understand you are performing your job and I shall therefore try to follow your instructions .
When we demand that other countries respect the separation of powers , we must first of all do so ourselves .
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia ?
The Member States , showing the required ambition and flexibility , have made a decisive contribution to reaching these balanced and positive agreements .
Therefore , it is not admissible for fruit and vegetables to pay the price for a large part of the European Union &amp; apos ; s external policy .
And it is doing so by means of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs whose rapporteur on this issue will be Mrs Kaufmann , and it is also doing so on all those issues which are eventually going to be combined with the reflection of the Commission which President Prodi called the third reflection , which is going to come together in the debate of the IGC 2004 .
I feel that the Commission &amp; apos ; s new phase is important . In particular , the B@@ ama@@ ko project provides a focus for the European Union in terms of immigration .
The Commission , for its part , totally shares this approach , and will firmly commit itself to the process of drawing up the Charter and , of course , Mrs Hal@@ on@@ en , we will communicate to the next Commission your invitation to the Commission to make specific proposals in this regard .
I should also like to ask the Commission to thoroughly prepare its position before attending meetings of the SEA@@ F@@ O and the other RFOs , by consulting the sector . This requires good communication and relations between the Commission and the industry .
The first is that the openness of the markets and progress of exchanges should be of reasonable dimensions and that the textile sector should be assisted in its process of restructuring .
This apart , however , there are two elements which I do believe to be important .
It is also essential that the public institutions participate together with the NGOs , in particular the local institutions , where they can do extremely important work .
I want to say this , Mr President , because it is in the interest of Parliament and the Community as a whole to have a strong Commission .
Mr President , to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new . It has been said many times .
My first speech in Parliament , in June last year , was on the subject of Iran , in the wake of the latest wave of executions .
Besides your own name , Commissioner - and I wish to echo the praise of previous speakers - that of the rapporteur , Nico@@ le Fontaine , a French and European lawyer , whose good offices will for ever be associated with this directive , stands out on this list .
This increase is clearly having a negative impact on growth during 2004 and on the growth forecast for next year .
Ladies and gentlemen , there is one issue that gave me great cause for concern throughout the negotiations , since it touches on an essential aspect of the package .
Thirdly , we need to act to make the market more transparent .
It is very positive that a resolution is recognising the equal value and dignity of all European languages and urging the Commission and Council to act decisively in this field and to find a permanent legal basis .
With this oral amendment , my group - and , I think , several other groups - will be able to support the amendment tabled by the GUE / NGL Group .
Today , the Commission is reiterating the measures that it had announced to us .
I believe we must take a more courageous step forward and begin to define the final parameters on which the two parties must agree .
These thoughts are fully applicable to this report .
The common position , therefore , maintains the balance between the various general objectives and the various interests , and we have not therefore tabled any amendments .
Instead of focusing on our demands in detail , something that some of my colleagues have done , I would like to emphasise a point without which the targets above are not possible : infrastructure .
If this is the way it has behaved in this affair , what are we , or the Union &amp; apos ; s citizens , to think of the lack of coordination , information , control and transparency that prevails in DG VI , or the demo@@ tiv@@ ation of its officials , who see responsibilities moved up and down and back and forth ?
We know that our infrastructure is weaker , but we also know that the European Union can never find enough funds to tackle the infrastructure we need to create jobs .
Madam President , I should first like to thank Mr B@@ au@@ tista O@@ jeda for his excellent report . I am sure he knows he can rely on total support from my group .
Through the Member States , the people of Europe have transferred certain competences to the Union . They have even sur@@ rendered some of their sovereignty to ensure that the Union is in a better position to respond to their needs .
The idea - at the request of most group Chair@@ men - was that the four rapporteurs would speak first , and then the representative of the Commission would follow .
Another reason for this Parliament and , of course , for me personally , to be pleased , is the fact that the decisions adopted by the Council at the Laeken Summit take up the tenor of the positions that this Parliament has expressed on several occasions .
If the legislation is insufficient , the Commission will have to put forward a new proposal , and we will give it our total support , and , in the meantime , I believe that the attitude shown by the Spanish Government - to immediately seek investors to resolve the problem , which has already had a result - shows that the Government &amp; apos ; s will is precisely in tune with social concerns and that it wishes to prevent the closure of this fac@@ tory .
It is shameful to see the Council as an institution and all its members acting in a collective fashion , collectively av@@ a@@ iling themselves of the law used by defen@@ dan@@ ts in court .
We also need to continue working intensively in the area of prevention .
The initiatives put forward by citizens of various countries will unleas@@ h a European debate in every country , not just a purely national debate .
I believe , Mr President , and I do not believe I am far wrong , that it is our duty to ensure that the fisheries legislation in the Mediterranean evol@@ ves to the point where it is equal to that in other Community regions .
We need to ensure that this programme will reach out to all countries , and especially those most in need .
In order to achieve this objective , which is still a long way off , we have much ground to cover and many barriers to remove .
Mr President , I also think that there are ample reasons to support the amendments tabled for this report , and that the report is very valuable .
In order to increase employment , it is not enough to implement measures of a structural nature , such as reducing tax and social costs .
If we do indeed all agree that we wish to create an area of freedom , security and justice , we must work to ensure that its three components work fully and with equal intensity throughout the territory of the European Union .
Mr President , having heard Commissioner Fischler &amp; apos ; s answer it gives me the impression that at the moment on this matter the Commission is completely un@@ prepared .
We must share responsibility for this serious problem which the whole of European society is obliged to confront .
When are we really going to see something practical done about this urgent matter ?
I had the opportunity to condemn these actions yesterday in plenary .
I think that that is the very great merit of Mrs McNally &amp; apos ; s position and I must therefore congratulate her on her report .
We need to stress to the regional and local authorities the opportunity offered by the Structural Funds to address the challenge of water efficiency in terms of saving and re@@ using water .
Nevertheless , this is not a round trip , although there is no doubt about the need for development processes to be participatory if they are to be effective and sustainable .
I must particularly highlight , due to their symbolic value , two parliamentary proposals incorporated during the discussion process .
I should have been with the victims of terrorism from my country , but I am here out of respect for all of you .
I would like to say that the other aspect which the rapporteur &amp; quot ; s group calls into question - by means of the amendments - is the creation of a bi @-@ regional regional solidarity fund .
I do however think that special attention should be paid to the changes proposed in order to introduce coordination instruments at all levels . In particular , I believe that the suggestions included in the proposal concerning cooperation with the Member States of the Union are most relevant .
Cooperation between the European Union and the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) has therefore become a key item on our agenda .
We are talking here about immigration , about terrorism , about pas@@ se@@ relle clauses and about organised crime .
This must be made quite clear in the Committee on External Economic Relations .
Finally , I would like to point out that the procedure adopted for the supervision of state aid for regional development purposes ought to be subject to the demands of economic and social cohesion . Further , the method of determining resources must take account of the legal concept of ultra@@ peripher@@ ality .
We have known you for many years and we know of your commitment and dedication , not only to what we could call the European cause , but also to ensuring that the European cause really reaches the citizens .
In short , without such measures , the Canary Islands &amp; apos ; fishing industry , which is increasingly a minority interest as it is , would end up by disappearing altogether .
With regard to the Member States , I can tell you that next week I will present the Commission with a report on the practical application of the euro .
We will finish with the speech by the rapporteur , Mr E@@ ppink , whom , of course , we congratulate , as the majority of his colleagues have praised his work as author of this report .
I am convinced we shall succeed .
We believe that this is a question that requires an immediate response from the Commissioner .
I will not deal with these three issues in detail . I will restrict myself to making a few comments on each of them .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , first I would like to thank Mr Tannock and Mr Obiols for presenting the report and , without further ado , to inform you that my group is critical of the evolution and approach taken in the neighbourhood policy .
In my view , the European Union should promote something that the Presidency mentioned . Without being too specific , it is basically the fact that , clearly , there is a right that we must recognise .
All of this has its place within the framework of the debate we have held today on development cooperation and respect for the resources of third countries , certainly , but also in the knowledge that there are fishing opportunities which have not yet been utilised .
Within this context , I believe that we should welcome the fact that the Council of General Affairs Ministers has decided that the next three Presidencies - the German , Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies - should draw up a strategic plan .
We must all ensure the success of those who are working hard to achieve decent levels of democracy , freedom and progress in those countries , as a necessary precondition for stability and prosperity to become a reality in their societies .
But I believe this is not contradictory , on the contrary , with a legitimate interpretation of international law which I ask to be done formally .
Let me take 30 seconds to explain the rule established by the Bureau to you , because I recognise that it is most dis@@ agree@@ able for Members to request the floor but not to be given it .
There are , therefore , two problems .
The Growth and Stability Pact is intended to serve as an instrument to facilitate antic@@ yclical action by the public finances .
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on illegal immigration , external action of the European Union and Frontex .
Mr President , I shall comment very briefly on this agreement , since it is very late and this is not the time .
If , furthermore , it provides additional information on the sustainability of the product , the independence of the control and certification body must be guaranteed , as the rapporteur quite rightly points out .
I also want to thank the Commission for its excellent cooperation , and the services of the Committee on Industry and my parliamentary group for their invaluable help .
Before ending my first speech , I would like , if you will allow me , to stress two elements relating to the European economy in a more general sense .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think we must first congratulate and thank the Commission for the fact that we are today holding this debate on the serious situation of the European shipbuilding industry .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank you once again for the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s constant and determined majority support for the GALILEO satellite navigation programme .
That must be the basis for our work , in order to achieve a reasonable level of safety so that this kind of event does not occur again on our seas and along our coastlines .
The second is sanction mechanisms against those who have not yet adopted legal measures to stop po@@ ac@@ hers , in particular , benefiting from impunity .
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly .
Our work is based on the principle that articles are incorporated into the Treaty because they are expected to be used subsequently .
For this reason , I should like to remind the Commission that the proposal for a resolution on shipbuilding included an amendment that called for a study on how to address the problems described .
I would like to ask the Commission to call on national governments and on the Council to ensure that Community provisions are duly transposed into national legislation .
In addition , the report provides that in future , once sufficient experience has been gained in this field , the Commission should be called on to submit a legislative proposal to strengthen cooperation among Member States and improve the recognition and enforcement of decisions on the protection of adults and in@@ capacity mandates .
Most significantly , however , the European Parliament is going to be involved in the assessment and follow up of the performance of the agencies within Europe &amp; apos ; s institutional structure . I refer to Europol , the European Asylum Support Office , Eurojust and Frontex .
What is at stake here , Commissioner , is something extremely important : the credibility of the single currency , the credibility of the most important operation the Union has undertaken in a very long time .
What I want to say , Mr President and Mrs Díez , is that committees of inquiry are laid down in Rule 151 of our Rules of Procedure - I would ask you to read them , please .
Secondly , in relation to the development of recent events in the European Union , the Community will report on the state of the enlargement negotiations , the development of the discussions within the framework of the European Convention and the development of the security and defence policy .
I believe that the Union for the Mediterranean is not only about trade , but also about defending international law and human rights .
We are talking about a Fund that is a political instrument and , as such , it must resolve the difficulties faced by the areas affected and the people living in them .
It is a warning call to the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean area , which historically and cultur@@ ally has enriched our European continent .
The high level group for the social and labour market integration of ethnic minorities set up by the Commission is paying special attention to issues relating to the Roma community .
The second element of concern to us , of course , relates to the fact that the supposed fight against terrorism is often used to justify wars , massacres and torture . We saw that this morning when we discussed the Fava report , and elsewhere .
I therefore believe that the future European forest plan must opt clearly for a policy for preserving our forests and enhancing and making the best possible use of the immense resources obtained from forest soil .
Mr President , the serious accident at the Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hi@@ ma nuclear plant has called into question the supposed rena@@ iss@@ ance of nuclear energy .
With regard to prevention , Madam President , prevention cannot and must not be used as a missile amongst democratic countries and States .
We believe , Mr President , that the legislative programme is an indispensable interinstitutional instrument for planning and coordinating Union activities in a transparent manner , and we therefore seek , Mr Santer , an effort in the right direction to achieve these objectives .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal for a regulation that we are considering today is the second stage of this re@@ orientation which the Commission &amp; apos ; s new direction is based upon .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I wish to express my thanks to the Commission .
In order to do this , we have suggested the possibility of establishing a clause that will ensure that the liberalisation of the market does not lead to distortion .
Secondly , as a personal statement , I would like say to Mr Nassauer and Mr Coelho that no part of my report promotes illegal immigration or allows a work permit in the European Union to be granted to people who enter illegally .
I ask Spain especially to recognise the independence of Kosovo , as this is what its people have decided , and this is what Europe has also recognised .
We know what we want and we have said it .
I think that what we are doing is coherent , I think that it needs to be done , and I think that it is important that we also do it - I would like to stress this - irrespective of the motiv@@ ations that might be behind it .
We must be coherent and uphold the Charter here and in our own national parliaments .
( Inter@@ ruption by the President to request silence )
I think a view of Europe firmly based on the tangible , the material , is a legitimate view of the project .
Finally , Mr President , I will refer to foreign policy .
The issue we are dealing with is fundamental , linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , and it therefore seems to us to be essential to achieve the greatest possible agreement amongst the members of the international community and , specifically , amongst the members of the Board of Govern@@ ors of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
If it does not , we shall have squandered a unique opportunity .
I have been able to observe their efforts closely , as well as their coordination with all the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
There is the risk that if Europe advances too rapidly , if it causes a crisis in industry , if it only implements policies - I should say &amp; apos ; meta@@ policies &amp; apos ; - from the top down , it will not work .
The discoura@@ gement felt by many Members when we see that things are not improving and that we have to deal with this issue over and over again in this Chamber is understandable , but we must not for that reason cease to raise the issue whenever events such as the recent ones take place , involving the repression of human rights activists , radio stations , teachers &amp; quot ; unions , activists , journalists , trade union@@ ists in different fields , former parliamentarians , etc . Only with the help of vigorous and decisive measures on the part of the European Union , the Commission and this Parliament where Cambo@@ dia is concerned might actions of this kind be reduced or eliminated .
Unfortunately , we do not think the plan of action we are discussing is sufficiently ambitious , since it does not specify concrete measures or adequate funding .
With regard to the control of EU expenditure , I believe that the European Union - the Commission , OLAF ( the European Anti @-@ Fraud Fraud Office ) and the European Parliament - have the necessary instruments to control fraud , and I naturally imagine that , in the future , it will be treated with the same degree of severity and rigour as it has in the past .
It is very important , as has been said here , to speed up the process of ratification in the national parliaments , including those agreements currently being negotiated , as is the case with Algeria .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , there are silen@@ ces that speak volumes , which make themselves heard , and the complicity of which is horri@@ fying .
I believe the European Commission is doing much more than people are aware of .
The 2000 @-@ 2004 2004 multiannual programme for sustainable development in the urban environment is an appropriate instrument for achieving this end , and the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordinating and developing actions .
It has reached positions on fundamental issues such as safeguarding our parliamentary rights and the length of financial perspectives . Parliament has already made its views known on the latter .
It has not been a time without serious problems , but in spite of all , relations between the Commission and Parliament could not have been better .
Mr President , it appears that today , at the request of the Cuban Government , the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is going to vote for a draft resolution on the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo .
We cannot simply wait for lobbies and interest groups to pressure us : we must make the effort to get close to the public ; to listen to them .
The entire process of European integration has been characterised by a constant effort to consolidate the democratic progress made within the interinstitutional relationship , which has essentially taken the form of greater competences for Parliament in decision @-@ making making .
In my view , as some honourable Members have indeed pointed out , the national will to apply the pact is absolutely vital .
The European Commission needs to have an effective presence , both in terms of human and technical resources , in all these organisations and , as I said , in those that may be created in the future .
Let us not repeat the mistakes following the Iraq war : Cha@@ os and the collapse of the Palestinian institutions could harm Israel , which is seeking security .
In fact , we believe that the Euratom loans are an appropriate instrument .
The European Union must , for once and for all , take responsibility and do everything possible so that CO2 emissions are reduced by 40 % by 2020 .
New addi@@ tions for this year are the neighbourhood policy , the creation of a European diplomatic service and of a European external action service .
Mr President , I should like to deal very briefly with two matters .
We are fundamentally talking about democracy , Mr President , because we are talking about equality and freedom , the combination of which should result in democracy .
The Agency , which would be responsible for these vessels and for the deployment at different strategic points on European coasts , must also implement a series of plans for responding to maritime accidents of this type .
Madam President , I believe that it would be premature to draw the conclusion that the sp@@ lu@@ t@@ tering peace process in the Middle East will be bur@@ ied as a result of these elections or that these elections herald the death of the Oslo agreements .
With regard to the European Ombudsman , I would like to say that he has cooperated magnificently with this Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Petitions and has done good work , despite the scant resources at his disposal .
Firstly , on the role of the Commission and the appointment of its President , secondly , on the common foreign and security policy and , thirdly , on diversity , subsidiarity and shared sovereign@@ ties in the European Union .
The truth is , however , that in Parliament , and in the whole of the European Union &amp; apos ; s sector , there are certain problems that , in all of the Member States , we have seen as priorities within the reform .
In any event , I would like to place my group &amp; apos ; s objection on record .
We cannot afford more failures , above all the developing world , and this is a question of survival .
I am referring not only to the paramilitary organisations and the guerrillas , but also to the drug trafficking organisations .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to repeat that at this Madrid Summit , which , as I have said , we expect to be attended by 48 Heads of State and Government , a bi @-@ regional regional process based on a strategic partnership will be consolidated .
It is Rule 145 , Mr Borrell Fon@@ tell .
As I said , some of the criticisms have certainly been more founded than others , but criticism there has been , and I think that this deserves serious consideration . I am asking on behalf of the Council , that Parliament give us this time for reflection .
Policy changes are therefore required in order to re@@ ori@@ ent our economic model , stop the dis@@ integration of our productive structure and prevent any increase in the adverse social and climatic effects that are now occurring .
The small @-@ scale scale fishing fleet and the areas that are highly dependent on fisheries need to be treated differently and need greater socio @-@ economic economic support .
Congratulations , Commissioner . Without your total dedication to this cause , it would not have come to this apparently happy ending .
Mr President , at its first reading , Parliament did nothing about this directive because it appeared to be a technical directive which presented no difficulties .
In view of the above , Mr President , I do not share the doubts expressed in nu@@ m@@ bered paragraph two of the report about the meaning@@ fulness of the EN@@ P &amp; apos ; s geographic scope .
The European Union should be a global example of marine research , but it is not , not even - and I say this to Commissioner Fischler - with his proposed reform , which pus@@ hes science into the background .
Mr President , in the absence of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , and on his request , I will speak on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his understanding remarks about an extremely serious problem in Spain which , in my own region of Ara@@ g@@ on , as well as in the Pyrenees , is coming to a head in a way that may have a series of repercussions over the next few years .
It should be understood that it is crucial to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Summit on the &amp; apos ; communitisation &amp; apos ; of asylum policy and the fair and humanitarian treatment of refugees and immigrants .
Today the European Union is united against the death penalty , and this is reflected in the European Union &amp; apos ; s Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 2 , where it mentions the right to life .
It is therefore essential that , before there is any foreign international investment , we guarantee that there is at least an analysis of the impact of those investments on human rights .
Clearly neither the European Parliament nor any other institutions are competent to decide on the final status of the territory ; it should be established by the Security Council that adopted Resolution 1244 .
This Parliament is involved in codecision and has a lot of work to do .
We should therefore encourage synergies between those universities with a strong entrepreneurial culture and companies that are truly driven by knowledge .
That is the wording of the oral amendment , Mr President , and I hope that the House can accept it .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission does not intend to present a proposal on the prohibition of night flights at Community level , for various reasons .
To be effective , aid must arrive at the right time .
The French Presidency therefore proposed that non @-@ EU EU companies providing services in the Union should have to register in all fifteen countries , which contradicts the objective of simplification .
Honourable Members , indeed , there is still work to be done , but we certainly place our trust in the dialogue and what we could refer to as the impact of the dialogue and its effects .
It is true that Regulation ( EEC ) No 1408 / 71 refers to the coordination of social security systems in the Member States .
Parliament in particular has already adopted a resolution on the crisis at its last part @-@ session session .
I believe the job of the Presidency @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council is to unite wills , forge agreements and make sure , in short , that the European Union moves forward .
Ladies and gentlemen , the road map talked of a peace process that should lead to two States by the end of 2005 .
Mr President , I would like to join in congratulating Mrs Emili@@ a Fran@@ ziska Müller on her excellent work on this directive .
We can contribute to promoting measures in those waters for the sustainable management of fisheries resources , and for EU fishermen fishing tuna it would be a very positive thing to make more progress towards creating a network of tuna agreements similar to the one already in place in the Indian Ocean , as requested by the Committee on Fisheries in its opinion .
On the one hand , the Council has been most receptive to our Communication and adopted conclusions in this regard at the end of February .
I can understand that , but nevertheless , the Union does have close links with the countries responsible for the scandal I am referring to . I therefore believe that , although the Community has no competence , the Council should be concerned to make it very clear that Europe acts differently in its international relations .
I fully agree with the comments made by our colleague Joan Colom on the revision of the financial perspective .
Mr Meyer proved to be very receptive and we jointly signed seven amendments introducing the specific concerns of the Committee on Development .
The Commission supports a peaceful and constitutional solution to the crisis and that is necessary in order to hold free and equitable elections in the future within a climate which makes them possible .
All policies should be integrated into environmental policy - as stated in some of the amendments - and public participation and information is necessary - also as stated in some of the amendments .
We could discuss whether our past experience , gained from implementing the pact during periods of growth , has led us to the conclusion that it is only applicable to that end .
Mr Papoutsis &amp; apos ; demand is a good one and we shall bear it in mind , but it is also pessimistic about the possibility of reforming the Treaty on European Union .
In a manner that demonstrates considerable coherence , we have managed to update that principle in the Constitution , translating it to the reality of a globalised world .
This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately . We must ensure respect for human rights , tolerance and multicultur@@ alism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues .
I am optimistic about that .
For all of these reasons , I would repeat that I am not going to vote for the resolution and I hope that my fellow Members will at least listen to my arguments , regardless of how they vote tomorrow . If they vote like me , all the better .
This is all because we are incapable of standing up to a situation of unfair competition in the face of a reality of dis@@ loyalty and dumping , while we wait for the Commission and the Council to adopt courageous and firm decisions of great political significance .
If infrastructures do not get there , how are we going to develop ?
Mr President , I simply wish to say that at 7@@ .30 p.m. an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs will begin , for an urgent consultation that the Council has requested .
Based on the legal considerations of the EC Treaty , we argue that the APIM be kept as it is for now , and that it be consolidated within the obligatory reform of Regulation ( EEC ) 1911 / 91 .
There is broad agreement between the Council , the Commission and Parliament , also demonstrating that a good method has been employed .
This delegation cannot accept this text &amp; apos ; s mention of an agricultural product - co@@ tton - and its recommendation that assistance to that sector be reviewed and restricted .
To speak with one voice , to aspire to a leading role not only economically but also , surely , politically , demands more of us .
There are two roles here : the fundamental role of the European Parliament and the role of the national parliaments .
We believe that the European Union should really have to make more inci@@ sive budgets in terms of stimulating economic growth that will create employment , and for this purpose allocating resources that belong to all the EU countries is absolutely necessary .
Having said this , please allow me briefly to address certain comments to you , from the point of view of the outgoing Commission , regarding the work carried out by the Committee of Independent Experts in this second report .
We are , however , open to examining how best to use the existing statistics on production and marketing to benefit the objectives of the The@@ matic Strategy .
Mr Schmit &amp; quot ; s fine words , for which we are certainly grateful , must be translated into a clear commitment to cohesion .
There is no doubt that we have made progress and that is clear from the report on the implementation of this year &amp; apos ; s broad economic policy guidelines , but we must not view this progress as completely satisfactory .
What more can be done therefore to increase compliance with international humanitarian law and thus limit the suffering of the victims ?
There has been much progress in this field and in the field of cooperation in criminal matters and we have demonstrated that when we have political will we can be effective .
I think that , if we make an effort , we can achieve a good result .
He has also talked about the level of remuneration and I also believe that he has made an interesting observation on the problems it can prevent .
We must therefore continue to insist that this House maintains Mr Napolitano &amp; apos ; s report , produced by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , which included , amongst other things , increasing the participation of the regions in decision making , the adaptation of Community legislation and the right to bring cases before the Court of Justice of the European Communities .
Together with these requests to the Council and to the Member State governments , requests that we put forward in the resolution we would like to see adopted , we also wish to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to step up its cooperation in demo@@ bili@@ sing armed groups in developing countries . At present this applies most particularly to Africa .
And I am addressing Mr Cox so that he might have the opportunity to send compli@@ ments to the representatives of his group who s@@ at on the European Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I regret having to speak once again to defend the cause of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi .
Only foreigners from Union countries are good foreigners in the European Union .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I have three messages for you .
I therefore believe that we have a debate pending on the consolidation of this social state .
In the case of some others , I will request a different wording which will render them acceptable to the Commission .
The new European regulatory framework providing for the integration and interoperability of the market will allow rail companies to increase their competitiveness and orien@@ tate their business activities towards the growth of market sectors such as European goods services .
As Mr Solana has said , all of this comes within a context of posi@@ tives and nega@@ tives .
To conclude , with regard to the report on the cultural dimensions of the EU &amp; apos ; s external actions , I would like to highlight the importance of culture in our cooperation policies . It is important to create a better mutual understanding with third countries and , in these times of great upheaval to the south of our borders , I believe it makes a lot of sense to answer these questions .
The latest general call for proposals for the European initiative on democracy and human rights illustrates our commitment . EUR 4@@ 2.@@ 6 million will be allocated to related projects in the 29 selected countries .
Finally , I want to point out that the objective of the directive should be cultural as well as economic .
In view of this situation - as Minister Frattini has said - it is clear that it is not possible to change the common position set in 1996 and we must - and I address this directly to the President ? in @-@ Office Office of the Council - prevent any gesture which could be interpreted as an internal difference within the European Union .
Mr President , the European Parliament put its full trust in Mr Böge to negotiate an acceptable financial perspective package for the European Union .
In this sense , democratic conditionality , used in a constructive manner , is a key tool in the European Union &amp; apos ; s development policy .
We wish to study the use of current budgetary resources , reconsidering their use , in order to promote the large @-@ scale scale assimi@@ lation of intermodal transport by industry .
The European Union must , through all possible channels , demand that the Government of Equatorial Guinea free all political prisoners and end the coercion suffered by the democratic forces , in order to guarantee that the coming municipal elections bring hope to the people of Guinea and lead to fruitful relations between Guinea and the European Union .
The Commission agrees with Parliament that it is necessary to adopt a broad approach in order to promote the use of energy sources with low carbon content in order to satisfy demand .
Therefore , I am very pleased that it is the Spanish Presidency that has managed to break the deadlock on this issue and that in 2002 , under the Spanish Presidency , we will have the first reform of the Electoral Act .
Moreover , the fact that we do not even know at this stage whether or not the Council has acknowledged receipt of this report seems quite unacceptable .
On the one hand , there is the decision by the head of the Israeli government to put the peace negotiations on hold due to the violence in the area and focus on the creation of a government of national unity with the head of the opposition , Mr Sharon .
I am delighted at what Mr Ci@@ o@@ lo@@ ş had to say .
In principle , we agree with Mr Savary &amp; apos ; s request and there are just a few remaining questions with regard to the application of a cost @-@ benefit benefit analysis and with regard to the intensity of the proposed information mechanism .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 25 September .
Finally , I must point out that it is our duty to guarantee an atmosphere of fair competition on a world scale so that this industry , on which so many families in Europe , Spain and in my region , the Basque Country , depend , may move forward .
It has been said that ageing is the most far @-@ reaching reaching social phenomenon of the beginning of this century .
I would like to mention the budgetary dimension of the Barcelona Process , now the Union for the Mediterranean , in which we have placed such great hope . We want a Europe that can continue to feed its people and can wage war on the scourge of hunger and social exclusion around the world .
There has been no amendment from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs offering us an alternative .
Mr President , we have a definitive text , approved at the conciliation meeting of 17 April , which rounded off a long period of work .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by congratulating Car@@ lo Fa@@ tuzzo on his excellent work , and in particular on his efforts to introduce the many amendments suggested .
Further to the strategic association which the European Commission has initiated with Brazil and Mexico , this process could perhaps also form the approach to be taken in the negotiations on the Mercosur agreement , which have been stalled for too long .
Mr President , I have a specific question for the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . What is her opinion on the full participation of the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference ?
As you will remember , the Stability and Growth Pact stipulates close , on @-@ going going supervision of the Member States &amp; apos ; budgetary position during the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union .
The present directive is a response to the conclusions of the Auto @-@ Oil Oil programmes carried out by the Commission and will allow us to enjoy better air quality , which we are pleased about .
A genuine regional integration of the countries on the Southern shores of the Mediterranean is necessary .
Furthermore , Mr President , I believe - and I address this to my respected friend , S@@ him@@ on Peres , who said yesterday in Madrid that he was worried about the growth in anti @-@ Semitism Semitism in Europe - that we also all have to be concerned about the demonstrations of intolerance we are seeing on our continent .
The fight for equal opportunities and the struggle against violence affect us all and their success benefits the whole of society .
We set out to draft a shorter resolution this year . Unfortunately , I fear we have failed in our endeavour , as we did in previous years .
I wish to begin by giving special thanks to Karl von Wogau for his involvement in this process over the last 22 years .
Like Mrs Green , I do not think there can be a better example of what this European Parliament is here for .
Mr President , I regret Kosovo &amp; apos ; s unilateral declaration of independence .
We must not allow fundamentalist political ideas to hide behind the clo@@ ak of ethical objections .
Of course , we want Community procedures for asylum .
This is a good proposal , which we are convinced has been strengthened by Parliament , as the Commissioner has already said .
This Wednesday we will once again study the situation on the eve of the start of the negotiations .
It is essential that documents such as the Paris Declaration of March 2005 be taken seriously and periodically revised to produce the net aid figures .
Mr President , I am pleased to have the opportunity to present this important proposal to Parliament . It forms part of our policy of giving transport a human face , in other words , looking after citizens &amp; apos ; rights , passengers &amp; apos ; rights , as we announced in our White Paper .
Today , more than ever before , there is a need for the Union for the Mediterranean , for support for major projects and for institutional development .
In the face of totalitarianism and lack of freedom , there is no option but to have a strong and solid alliance with our natural partners , the United States : that is the only alliance that has produced , and will continue to produce , results .
These experiences are fundamental , and having been a member of a local council , I also believe that all the councils in Europe should make a commitment on this issue .
We are grateful to the rapporteur , Mr Tillich , because his attitude ensured that the vote in the Committee on Budgets gave satisfactory results , with certain amendments being approved .
That is the difficult question that we have been working on for many months .
Fortunately , the countries of the European Union have been pioneers in the creation and maintenance of a system of social protection which protects people from poverty and abandonment and therefore has helped tens of millions of Europeans without jobs .
However , we accept that equally valid reasons may still arise for the establishment of lesser objectives .
Mr President , as Mr Swoboda stated , Algeria has already seen a great deal of suffering with the continu@@ al deaths in the country , more often than not of innocent people , and also with the poverty that is devastating part of the population .
The judgment is therefore important due to the precedent that it sets .
A Head of State of a Member State even recently visited H@@ avan@@ a .
On the other hand , we have seen a necessary and expected decision : enlargement to the East .
Therefore it is extremely important to reach agreements with the other major world financial markets , notably the United States .
I believe that this is therefore decisive for the sector .
This is what we are gambling with and , for this reason , we feel we should once again draw your attention to the possibility of revising the Commission &amp; apos ; s initial approach .
The new Article 13@@ 0@@ a of the Treaty of Amsterdam already introduces a legislative point , and a declaration made at the Amsterdam Conference also goes in the same direction .
The first is whether , during the meeting of the Quartet on 30 March , they noted any dis@@ sent from Russia , in view of Hamas &amp; apos ; s visit to Moscow and the European Union &amp; quot ; s position on the Belarus elections .
However , at present , according to international rating agencies , Spain heads the European Union poverty in@@ dex , with 20 % unemployment and a deficit of EUR 78 billion .
Some will be successful and some will fall by the wa@@ y@@ side , but if we do not create a policy of multiple initiatives of many types , allowing society to express itself and take advantage of its resources , we will not achieve anything .
The Commission has indicated that it is in favour of incorporating the fisheries plan and we hope that the Council will also lend it its support .
The Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean partnership makes sense if it is the instrument used to remove those obstacles and to promote dialogue and cooperation between North and South , but also to prioritise South @-@ South South relations in those regions , which are greatly weakened .
With regard to Lithuania , I am not going to deny the obvious , of course : its economic results are magnificent . The efforts it has made to improve its economic situation are extraordinary .
Mr President , Commissioner , Madam President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , I must thank you for agreeing , on most points , with the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s resolution , which lays down our whole philosophy on climate change .
establish a coordinated and integrated management of the Union &amp; apos ; s external borders ;
Mr President , we cannot forget that this proposal amen@@ ds a previous proposal and that the Member States and the Commission itself therefore already have a great deal of experience with it .
To this end , it is important that we analyse the political , geographical and economic circumstances of each crisis and each type of immigration .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin my speech by stressing the importance and significance of the recommendation we are debating today .
There is of course the risk that , at a particular juncture , the Council may not agree , and that it would then take a backward step and act simply through intergovernmental agreement .
The report on the regulation is in deadlock because , amongst other things , the rapporteur alleg@@ es that she has not received all of the documentation from the European Commission .
I believe that the efficiency of an enlarged single market , the competitiveness of our industries and the sustainable development of the Union depend on this .
From Mrs Langenhagen &amp; apos ; s report I should like to highlight her observations on both the global and European frameworks , taking account of enlargement .
In some way , this Community fisheries market , which is so temp@@ ting , is the greatest enemy of the Community producers themselves , because increasingly more is asked of us , more is demanded of us and more limits are imposed on us .
In my opinion , this motion for a resolution mis@@ ses the point .
The European Union must demonstrate its support for the en@@ ac@@ tment of national laws providing that citizens of the Member States who commit sexual crimes against children abroad must face the courts of their home country .
I think it is an excellent initiative , although I must also admit that it provo@@ kes some negative reactions . My colleagues who have yet to speak will not fail to mention that .
How can we do this ?
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .
With regard to Mrs Péry &amp; apos ; s report on the crisis in the fishing industry , the rapporteur deserves to be congratulated on her efforts to unite positions . On the specific question of markets , however , I should like to call on the Commission to present , in its new draft regulation , a genuine reform which is geared to the challenges of the common fisheries policy .
In the debate we have just held we rather confused the three elements .
In short , the report which will be presented to plenary tomorrow specifies in detail many areas in which the Romanian authorities must continue to make efforts .
Mr Bar@@ on , leader of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , referred earlier to the Casaca report on the importance of Parliament as a source of political power . There are also the legislative controls .
I think Mr Borg said that the procedure , or the monitoring of the entry and exit procedures for fishery products , was going to be done by the Commission , and that is happening right now .
I think that in conclusion , Madam President , we need to give our total support to Mr Patten &amp; apos ; s proposal and behave with maximum diligence and efficiency to support the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals today .
If codecision in agriculture truly existed , this crisis would have taken a very different direction .
The free movement of persons contributes to the meeting of cultures and the development of democracy .
The European Council requested the Commission to submit a study of the likely evolution of the economic situation together with the recommendations it envisages to the forthcoming European Council at Ghent .
And what does this mean ?
Have no doubt about it : this is our sole objective and our task here today .
Mr President , I am not sure whether Mr L@@ und@@ gren has actually asked a question , but in any event he and I agree that there is at least that point that you mentioned in your speech , Mr L@@ und@@ gren , and there are also the legal incompati@@ bilities which make it impossible at the moment to say that Sweden fulfils the criteria for joining the euro .
I therefore believe that the British Presidency has a great opportunity to present proposals aimed at making these objectives a reality .
This achieves the objective we have all shared from the outset and in this regard I regret the fact that the rapporteur , Mr Jarzembowski , believes that what is proposed here is insufficient .
The drawing up of a code of conduct applicable to the relations between Community officials and the citizens is a priority , and work is being done in that area by Mr Kinnock and the Commission in general .
Mr President , on behalf of my group and on my own behalf , I would like to thank the general rapporteur , Mr Costa Neves , and the other two rapporteurs , Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen .
Im@@ migrants must enter Europe and work there in full respect of the law .
Thank you very much , Madam President .
And this Parliament should not send unnecessary and discoura@@ ging messages to European farmers .
We are debating a crisis today , but we must draw sufficient strength from it to plan for our future in an intelligent manner .
I believe that the fight against the murder of women is essential , and should not be ignored under any circumstances .
In any event - also in relation to the Convention - it is important that we find formulae for qualified association .
Mr President , it was in this very House , almost seven years ago , at the end of the constitutional convention , when we Members of the European Parliament and members of the national parliaments succeeded in putting forward a proposal that was accepted by the Presidium .
The Seville European Council came up with a compromise formula that enables us to begin to negotiate with the candidates on the vast majority of the agricultural issues .
This latest revision of the directive is certainly intended to bring us into line with the Aarhus Convention , whilst also taking account of the study of the outcome of the unsatisfactory implementation of Directive 90 / 3@@ 13 / CEE .
The report , which I hope the vast majority of you will vote for , is an evaluation of the progress made in Europe on education and training policies in the period 2007 @-@ 2009 2009 .
These turn the proposal into something very different by introducing , first , the compulsory nature of this measure for the Member States ; secondly , Community cofinancing of the fund and the contribution of de@@ gressive launching aid ; thirdly , Commission participation in crisis management measures ; and fourthly , a broadening of the scope of this measure to cover pig@@ let producers and closed @-@ cycle cycle holdings .
This decision would run counter to the flexibility of management that we would like this body to have .
We are talking about all of that .
Nevertheless , I would like to say that , in this regard , there is an issue which is never discussed and which I believe is a part of European tradition , an issue which we should take into account : man .
I would say that that is politically entirely understandable , but do not tell me that it is a security problem .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to express my thanks for the magnificent work done by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen .
As I said before , the outermost regions have significant han@@ dic@@ aps , but they must be considered an opportunity for Europe .
I therefore support the resolution , which calls on Parliament to take action as a matter of urgency .
There is no question that the current situation justifies enhanced and more active cooperation with the American authorities in order to reinforce security aspects in view of the new terrorist risks .
Mr President , before beginning my speech , I would propose the following exercise , both to the people who are present and to those who are absent , because there is nobody here from the Council , although there should be .
Here , when something goes well , it is the country or region that claims all the credit , but when something goes badly , or there is a disaster , Europe is usually blamed .
However , all this will be of little use to us if there still continues to be insufficient coordination between the Commission and the competent national services .
The most controversial aspect of this directive is perhaps the use of tis@@ sues and cells from clon@@ ed human embryos , because of the important ethical and moral implications .
Madam President , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the message that I think we should send to the forthcoming European Council meeting is the need to restore and bolster the confidence of European citizens in our project .
It was traditionally believed in the media that it was necessary to go &amp; apos ; lob@@ b@@ ying &amp; apos ; in Brussels , to behave like a pressure group .
Lastly , we should be aware that the construction of major infrastructures is only one part , albeit an important part , of the EU &amp; apos ; s security of supply policy . This security also particularly depends on energy saving and the use of renewable energies .
Mr President , the W@@ ynne report we are currently debating represents an initial response to the Communication from the Commission on the new Financial Perspective .
Specifically , you have asked us to support you in relation to having more civil servants and more resources in order to deal with enlargement .
It is incongruous for the Council to prepare to adopt this decision rather than its own general law .
Mr President , I would like to start by answering the direct question put to me by Mr Bo@@ k@@ ros .
In environmental issues , and I do not know if this is true of other areas , such slow progress can have irreversible effects .
Secondly , we must speak about the funding of this plan , although this is not strictly an issue for our committee .
Therefore I would like to thank you for the work on the budget , especially Mrs Rühle , for her invaluable cooperation on this specific issue of the forecast of the issues .
The previous speakers - above all Mr Leinen , with whom I have had the great pleasure of collaborating in the drafting of this report - have spoken about many different subjects .
We must acknowledge , however , that certain measures are having an effect , but there is still a long way to go in order to make everything , shall we say , acceptable and correct .
However , our issue with Iran is not just about stoning , but about the very existence of the death penalty because the number of people executed in Iran is still one of the highest in the world .
Mr Aznar , my political group has strongly supported the Convention .
Therefore , we must be particularly sensitive to those countries which have recently embr@@ aced democracy and the defence of those values and which wish to contribute to their common defence .
I urge the presidency to continue along the path followed up to now , strengthening the elements of cohesion which have made possible the development of our Union and the peace of our continent .
By attending school , both boys and girls can and should receive a basic education that contributes to improving health , not just in relation to HIV and the ways in which it is transmitted - as the rapporteur reminds us - which , although it is a serious problem , is no more serious than other problems that could be alleviated more che@@ ap@@ ly . This is the case of food hygiene , to cite just one example .
I believe that they are all essential to defending the world and , above all , freedom .
That if a country detec@@ ts a particular kind of problem in a specific aircraft , it will be obligatory for that information to be distributed and passed on to all the countries of the Union ; and also that there be common rules on the way in which those controls are carried out , on the percentage and on the system .
We must be clear that it is not to help the poor people , but in our own interest .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , please do not answer me with an agenda .
The second one is the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is the symbol of the identity of European citizens .
. - Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to table an oral amendment to paragraph 12 . The amendment reads as follows in English :
However , it should be noted that Regulation 10@@ 82 / 2006 was adopted in July 2006 , one year after it was adopted unanimously by the European Parliament on a proposal from our colleague J@@ an O@@ l@@ br@@ y@@ ch@@ t , and has been binding in all Member States since 1 August 2007 .
By decisively adopting the necessary measures and taking the lead in cooperating with the other central banks in industrialised countries , the European Central Bank has served as our guide throughout this period and has substantially contributed to preventing huge financial collapse .
This international criminal court should be independent of the Security Council , should be able to undertake its own initiatives , should have wide jurisdiction covering crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes ( and therefore serious human rights violations ) , and should not be subsidiary to national justice .
This parameter will improve the situation of pensioners and orphans in comparison with the Regulation , since these people will benefit from the same provisions applicable to the same category of family benefits as self @-@ employed employed and salaried workers .
In this regard we must recognise that public opinion and the media are right when they make certain criticisms .
Of course , the report before us is guided by an objective , which is none other than a way of making the European economy more competitive in a global world .
Mr President , no@@ b@@ les@@ se oblige , so I would like to start by saying that I am infin@@ i@@ tely grateful for the support that all fellow Members representing their political groups have given to the report that I have had the honour to present to the House .
We therefore agree with what the rapporteur says about the need to have specific objectives , to state precisely what these objectives consist of and the fact that there should be a proper plan aimed at achieving them .
This is the third fundamental recommendation in this analysis and stock @-@ taking taking of the Lisbon European Council .
I refer , for example , to the undeniable need to give a boost to Community legislation regulating aspects as important as family reunification , asylum procedure , or reception conditions for asylum seekers , in order to achieve a proper organisation of migratory flows , which effectively comba@@ ts people trafficking in human need and who are responsible for the tragic deaths that are taking place in some parts of European territory , such as the Andalusian and other Spanish coastlines .
With this report we are also expressing the urgent need to establish the legal personality of the European Union so that it can cooperate effectively with the United Nations and its various agencies .
In any event , at Community level , we reached an agreement a whole year ago during the Spanish Presidency .
Having said that , I must also express my group &amp; apos ; s concern and disappointment at the outcome of the summit , although I appreciate that the incoming Dutch presidency will cast a more favourable light on the Irish presidency .
Ireland , like other countries , is part of the Monetary Union and the development of interest rates and exchange rates is a problem of interest to all the Member States .
This assessment is particularly important , above all , if we bear in mind that the European Union is the main donor in certain areas .
However , Commissioner , I would like to use the time I have left to make a few general remarks on coal research because I think it gives us cause for concern .
We are saying that a natural monopoly , such as a European network , should above all be European , there should be no national concept , but a global European one , which requires common technological , administrative and safety rules .
It proposes removing any type of quota , and I would like to ask : does it intend in the future to remove the system of aid to producers ?
Mr President , the situation in Sierra Leone has been the subject of our urgent debates on several occasions , and we have always dealt with it by encouraging peace talks , national reconciliation and aid for the displaced population , and by calling for an international criminal justice system that can try those responsible for the genocide that is being committed in that country .
We should like to congratulate Mr Camisón A@@ sensio for his work throughout these two readings and also the Commission for its excellent initiative and for accepting most of the amendments from this House .
I imagine that it will not be , as Minister Pi@@ qué said , that Europe should speak with a single voice in 2050 , because , as country fol@@ k would say , &amp; apos ; that is a journey that requires no s@@ add@@ le@@ b@@ ag@@ s &amp; apos ; .
In doing so , we are concerned that the effort to liberalise should not transform the essence of the current European social model .
This transatlantic relationship should be strengthened in two dimensions : the institutional dimension and the physical dimension , involving cooperation in practice .
Last December , this Parliament voted to maintain the financial perspective and the interinstitutional agreement despite the fact that , at that time , the Council drew out the negotiation to unacceptable limits .
Of course , I realize that , as always , it is the law which will provide our Ari@@ ad@@ ne &amp; apos ; s thread , and the thinking must come from a European Union which speaks with one voice .
Mr President , as the rapporteur , Mr Pirker , has said , this Parliament has already expressed its opinion more than once on the proposed Eurodac Agreement .
Faced with this deficit , the only solution that the European Commission has proposed is to increase imports of these protein crops , an increase that will grow worse after the new Member States have joined the Union .
Experience shows us that violence creates more violence and that when political changes are carried out in this way , it leads to new forms of oppression and injustice .
It is essential for the Community institutions to share the same objective , which will enable them to negotiate from a position of strength .
They are affected by more than one million accidents each year , which also impli@@ cate serious health risks , such as vir@@ al infec@@ tions , he@@ pati@@ tis C , AIDS and so forth . However , this is not only of significance to health workers but also to hospital patients and their families .
Mr President , Mr Borg , ladies and gentlemen , in this debate there are a number of things we need to recognise .
Mr President , we in the Group of the European People &amp; quot ; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats very much welcome this Directive .
I would like to thank the President , Pat Cox , and this Parliament , which represents many of the peoples of Europe .
We know that this is a difficult and complex matter , but , Commissioner , I would like to ask you two questions .
We are sure that , thanks to this way of proceeding , we will be able to achieve successful results .
This is not , however , a question of principles .
I believe that Community money is spent better and more effectively in Brussels than in the average Member State .
Since the first oil crisis , the problem of unemployment has been near the top , if not the first item , on our governments &amp; apos ; agendas .
I am certain , I hope and I trust that the Commission and the Council will do everything possible in the months and weeks to come , which are so significant , to strengthen this relationship , including through the institutional dimension .
Moreover , with the application of the new Treaty , this agreement marks the end of what could be termed a test or trial period for the codecision procedure and Parliament &amp; apos ; s role as a co @-@ legislator legislator .
My second comment concerns action to combat the financing of terrorism .
What kind of measures is the European Commission taking to force the Pakis@@ tan@@ i authorities to refrain from supporting and facilitating terrorist group activities ?
The next item is the debate on the report by Elmar Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the Commission &amp; apos ; s 2007 enlargement strategy paper .
Mr President , the victims must be heard , they must be respected and they must be protected , and the resources must be provided for doing all of this .
