The role of the European Parliament will be crucial in this respect , but we know that we will only succeed if all those involved - and Member States , in the first place - are ready to commit and take responsibility .
The principal issues in crises like these are securing the safety of the area and of the people , attending to medical needs and providing food , water and shelter .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , we urge you not to give up on your efforts to break the deadlock at the IGC and secure a constitution for Europe before the elections to this House in June .
Does the Commission not take the view that it should propose a comprehensive legal measure to lay down monitoring standards with the purpose of regulating private pension funds ?
What is your opinion on that ?
The Commission , Council and international financial institutions must consider measures to help protect the population of the region against severe economic hardship .
It would be constitu@@ tionally inde@@ lic@@ ate I am sure for me to urge them to vote in one way or the other but I do very much hope that these negotiations which have been conducted in good faith and have led to very satisfactory outcomes will be endorsed by the people of Switzerland .
It has been extremely difficult because of the difficulties I have outlined to you , but we might be able to make some progress .
We will talk to the Commission again , should it not live up to this promise .
At the very time we are seeking these steps forward , the non @-@ governmental governmental organisations which play a leading part in sustaining and nurturing public , professional and political awareness of health issues are being faced with potentially damaging budget cuts .
It must do something to stop it .
We want to move the debate forward .
I hope that the Commission has not forgotten about that and will soon produce a proposal for a directive dealing with unlawful remo@@ vals prior to 1993 .
We looked into them and took them into consideration .
I understand it has been referred to a judicial review .
The exten@@ sions which have been tabled are sensible on the whole and therefore acceptable to the Socialist Group .
But I do have a question since the Commission was not responsible for negotiating on behalf of the EU when it came to the criminal enforcement chapter which was dealt with by the Council on behalf of Member States .
Mr President , the issue of the territorial limitations of contribu@@ tory infringement is the reason why software product claims were originally written and permitted by the European Patent Office .
In response to your question , without first having the general overall far @-@ reaching reaching directive , it is very difficult to set standards of a European character in the area of discrimination against disabled people .
In turn - and this is my third point - we insist absolutely on the conditionality of our assistance .
The Republic of Ireland &amp; apos ; s Government said it wanted greater cooperation with Northern Ireland , but the first time there is a bit of trouble , it runs away !
To the extent that it might concern the European Commission , including as a competition authority , we certainly are prepared to look into it .
So I am very pleased with this .
the report by A@@ tan@@ as Paparizov , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 17@@ 75 / 2005 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks - C6 @-@ 03@@ 19 03@@ 19 / 2007 - ,
We should point out that it gave a statement of assurance in relation to revenue and administration .
Therefore , we will vote against this resolution , not because we disagree with its contents but because we must wait to see the outcome of the aforementioned efforts .
I want to speak from the perspective of the rapporteur on internal market strategy for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
We have no idea what our policies are going to be by 2013 .
I think that this discussion should never have taken place in the European Parliament .
We , as Parliament , will obviously play our part in full .
It is time - and long overdue - that we look at results around the world that have worked .
Is he aware , for example , of the request from 37 million disabled people in Europe and many outside our borders that the United Nations should enforce better rights for disabled people ?
rapporteur . - Madam President , I would like to thank Commissioners Reding and Andor for their strong commitments on these important issues .
In view of our history , I am perhaps a little more liberal in my thinking about these particular issues .
author . - Mr President , there are three points that I would like to make concerning the ALDE amendments to this resolution .
It must be supplemented by further initiatives .
People around the world are cra@@ ving peace and a renewed sense of security .
At the same time , Parliament , Council and Commission also agree that legitimate interests have received adequate protection .
However , that is not all .
It is not easy to discer@@ n the myriad of concerns , some domestic , some European , which gave rise to the &amp; quot ; no &amp; quot ; result in Ireland .
However , I want to be clear on this .
We also have to address the issue of the possibility of the emergence of a digital divide in Europe .
A@@ ver@@ off report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 55 00@@ 55 / 1999 )
Is it an issue on which we have a realistic prospect of seeing progress during the course of the Irish presidency ?
This issue has come up under the Temporary Committee on Fo@@ ot @-@ and and @-@ M@@ ou@@ th M@@ ou@@ th Disease review .
in writing . I will be voting for this report .
That will continue , of course , but we should find a measuring mechanism by which we can clearly distinguish the present efforts we are making from the additional efforts which have to be made for climate change .
Liberals and Democrats welcome that , but Europe has changed since Tampere and this new agenda must reflect that .
I was delighted to cast my vote in favour of the excellent report by Mr Poos .
Euro@@ crats see them as opportunities to extend their ten@@ tac@@ les of power .
Given the developments which have occurred in recent years on the registering and treatment of complaints ( the &amp; apos ; EU Pil@@ ot &amp; apos ; project ) , as confirmed in its annual report on monitoring the application of EU law in 2009 , the Commission would like , in the near future , to update its Communication of 23 March 2002 on relations with the complainant in respect of infringements of Community law .
There is still time for this to be done .
However , the shift to the new regime will not be an easy task .
He or she will have to mainstream climate action , because climate action has to do with energy but also with the environment , research , agriculture and industry .
It also reflects the substance of the opinion given by the Scientific Group of Experts , referred to in Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty , and the current nuclear safety proposal is a second revision of the regional proposal in the area of nuclear safety .
From that point of view the dem@@ ise of the Stability Pact is good for stability .
Mr President , I too wish to thank my colleague George L@@ y@@ on for his excellent work on this report .
It is crucial that we act to counter declining fish stocks , but it is always important that our response is proportionate .
But you should be careful , because what you are proposing to EU citizens and Member States is that they should believe that Brussels knows better , and that politicians in Brussels are closer to the citizen &amp; apos ; interests than an M@@ P from their constituency .
We have pressed for decisive action to strengthen the judiciary and security @-@ related related institutions .
Madam President , unlike the last discussion , which was virtually unanimous in its approach , this is the exact opposite .
Mr President , we have had a few problems with voting in the House this week .
It is not therefore in a position to accept those amendments concerning the extension of the list of the products .
This will involve strong and close cooperation with all stakeholders , including Member States and industry , and , I would add , the support and involvement of the European Parliament .
Nevertheless , there are still grounds for concern in terms of press freedom , balanced political access to the media , and the right of free assembly and protest .
Some things we can do relatively quickly , others will take longer if , for example , complex legal changes are required .
As the rapporteur I look forward to a very vital debate , as we will expect for the completion of the financial services action plan that this directive will be pointed at as well .
Otherwise , Islamic fundamentalists throughout the world will use this conflict to galvanise the Islamic world against the West , using it as a pretext to justify worldwide terrorist attacks .
We are moving in the right direction but I have not been silent in trying to clarify to this Parliament what kind of a problem we had , the size of that problem and the complexity of it when we took office .
Our proposal has been prepared in close cooperation with Member States and the finance industry and was subject to extensive consultation .
Citizens need to know that Europe is not a simple free market .
But the single market on its own is not enough .
I will be more than happy to appear before the committee in November .
The continuous fall of nu@@ t prices threatens the future of our European producers .
They now have a tremendous fear of future WTO rulings .
These attacks are unacceptable : they are perpetrated by extremists with an agenda of intolerance which must be condemned and must be resisted .
Our Amendments Nos 1 , 8 and 18 bear on that point .
Two things have kept the Communist regime in place in Cuba .
It is important that the European Union does not suffer competitive disadvantage , vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis other parts of the world , as far as our engineering skills are concerned .
Mr President , very hear@@ ty congratulations to Mrs Rothe for an excellent report .
Citizens should be able to hold law @-@ makers makers accountable .
Mr President , I would like to make three observations .
However , it is clear that there must be some measure of control , and I look forward to hearing details of the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s strategy in due course .
To this end , a more sufficient funding system must be made available to poorer nations .
It is a continuous effort and there is always room for improvement , always a need to do more .
This plays very much to the EU &amp; apos ; s strengths as the world &amp; apos ; s largest donor .
I would like to know what commitment the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office intends to show to ensure that EU policies will always give special priority to assisting peripheral and island regions , including those regions on the Atlantic coast .
Mr President , I should like to make a point about the PPE @-@ DE DE recommended voting list .
With respect to the Council , I can only underline the comments made by the rapporteur , Mrs Avilés Pe@@ rea , that it is high time that the Council - which now has an increasingly operational role - be held to account for the way it spends taxpayers &amp; apos ; money .
Given my limited time , I would just like to make three brief points .
This must be done in several ways .
Your pending approval of this proposed directive is the culmination of considerable efforts on the part of the Council in reaching its common position , taking on many of Parliament &amp; apos ; s amendments from first reading ; on the part of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy in proposing amendments to that position and on the part of Parliament &amp; apos ; s delegation in reaching a constructive compromise with the Council .
A number of policy options have been put forward and Parliament has already expressed itself on them in order to guide the Commission in drafting concrete legislative proposals .
The same issue arises with candidate countries .
President of the Commission . - As the distinguished Member knows , I am sure , the European Commission has put forward a proposal - a horizontal directive - for non @-@ discrimination discrimination that also includes disability .
We voted against these elements of the text , but finally voted for the report in pursuing the better course of the migrant people in Europe .
Let me therefore just clarify a few essential points before we enter into the debate .
Madam President , let me first congratulate Mar@@ is@@ a and my colleagues for reaching an agreement with the Council on such a complex dossier .
I think what is necessary for us now is not to try to renegotiate everything .
The work needs to be done by the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
Those events and their associated price tag@@ s bring very close to home the reality of what un@@ checked climate change would mean for us .
I believe it would be particularly difficult to justify an exception so soon after we have all agreed the rules of the initiative .
Policies such as the &amp; quot ; Everything but Arms &amp; quot ; initiative that has opened up our markets to products from the least @-@ developed developed countries are a good example of this approach .
In addition , a wide range of affected sectors in Europe have a formal relationship with the Commission in this regard through EF@@ R@@ A@@ G , the European Financial Re@@ porting Advisory Group , which has been established for this purpose .
It is a compromise , but it is something that we have been able to agree upon .
It is a process of many issues around access to finance .
My group will be supporting the changes approved by the Constitutional Affairs Committee , and I am sure that Parliament as a whole will endorse them whole @-@ heartedly heartedly .
The contribution of Parliament to this debate , voted on 17 November , explicitly supports the Commission in its initiative .
Is the Council - not the Commission - concerned at the growing tide of protectionism coming up from fellow Member States and is the Council under your Presidency going to provide any leadership to combat this ?
Regarding agricultural products , at the moment we are deeply worried about the cost of production , supply and security of food .
First of all , I want to assure the Parliament that it would of course be consulted if there were any question of extending the Agency to other countries .
I can assure you that we take them very much into account .
Serbia has firm and tangible prospects of joining Europe .
Those Member States that did not ratify Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights should do this as well .
The ECB is accountable to the citizens of Europe through the European Parliament .
These are deeply dangerous .
The Council of Europe has also called on all its members to ratify or adhere to the ICC &amp; apos ; s Statute as soon as possible .
I know of no one with any interest whatsoever in fisheries who would not support the principle of environmentally friendly fishing methods : the people with most to gain , after all , from protecting the marine environment and ensuring a balance between conservation and har@@ ves@@ ting of fish stocks are the fishermen themselves .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , it is absolutely crucial that the G20 employment and labour ministers put quality jobs at the heart of their economic recovery plans .
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or je@@ wel@@ s in the cro@@ wn .
I see this particular proposal as an interim measure towards a European policy that actually bans discarding altogether .
We are therefore following very closely and with particular attention the electoral campaign in Ukraine in the run @-@ up up to the elections on 31 October .
in writing . - I voted in favour of Amendment 18 because the adoption of sexual orientation anti @-@ discrimination discrimination provisions is a requirement for EU accession and because increased legal protection against discrimination is a message that the government sends to the whole of society about the value of all members of society .
Therefore , I urge the Commission to start negotiations with the US authorities immediately , and tackle this issue as a matter of high political priority in its relations with the US .
It is cra@@ zy for us to be obliged to undergo this pon@@ der@@ ous and protracted Treaty revision procedure when we wish merely to reform a common policy .
We will continue our efforts engaging Iran but , at the same time , our efforts to increase the pressure , first of all , through a strengthening of the implementation of existing sanctions .
I would also like to thank the rapporteur , maybe in writing , for his efforts and for the overview reflecting the contributions made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , as well as the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee .
Let me give you a sense of where we stand at this moment .
It looks at the way money is spent .
This is one of the most brutal forms of human rights abuses that are very widespread , not only in the developing countries .
The Commission firmly believes that the dialogue with Egypt within the framework of the political arrangements set out in the Association Agreement and in the ENP action plan is the most effective way to impress upon the Egyptian Government the EU &amp; apos ; s concerns regarding respect for human rights and international law .
On our resolution , whilst it makes clear the values that Europe and India hold dear on commitment to democracy , pluralism , the rule of law and multilateralism , it is key that we are natural partners .
Does the Commission believe that it is right for these countries to be left to take that decision on their own , or does the Commission believe that it is acceptable to intervene politically and financially in that decision ?
Mr President , the French presidency has indeed faced many challenges , though it is de@@ ba@@ table whether the recent Council adequately addressed the challenge of combating climate change .
Bio@@ fuels will contribute to Europe &amp; quot ; s energy self @-@ sufficiency sufficiency , at a time of rising oil prices and in light of the recent controversy over gas supplies from Russia .
We therefore welcome the green paper as well as the Presidency &amp; quot ; s programme .
Mr President , I should like to welcome the report .
I believe that we have managed to reach a proper compromise .
This was always the Commission &amp; apos ; s intention .
The support provided by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is urgently needed by the workers , their families and the North Dublin community , deeply affected by the closure of this company , which brought the loss of more than a thousand skilled jobs .
In the end it is about governments with a capacity to deliver and about people who have the expectation that government might be able to improve their lives .
But reading between the lines , as one should , it is fairly clear that not much progress is being made to reform the Council .
Amendments Nos 21 and 22 impose an obligation to wait for prior written consent before proceeding with the export of GMOs .
The Commission is anxious to come up with a common framework , and in the longer term , to harmonise the methods by which decommissioning is financed in the EU .
Food security is a major dimension and indicator for poverty reduction and is a key element in this context .
So there is much in this report to like .
Madam President , I too had not intended to take the floor , but this issue has now occupied our attention for three @-@ quarters quarters of an hour .
Finally , at the same time , we are firmly convinced that all countries have the responsibility to help developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty and achieve progress towards the MDGs .
In addition , Member States can also put forward proposals for joint operations and pilot projects which the agency may then decide to co @-@ finance finance .
And that sets out more guidelines and the way forward that we want to see happening .
in writing . - This report shows the value of the work of Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Petitions .
The second important consideration - to which the Commissioner too attaches a lot of importance - is freedom of movement .
The time has come , accordingly , for NATO and its members to act , and since European Union Member States make up over half of the 19 members of NATO , the EU has a special responsibility to promote action .
But it is not enough for us to have separate programmes and projects , welcome as those may be .
So the kind of movement in thought - and it is a European movement in thought - which the European Free Alliance represents is actively discriminated against by a criterion specified simply in terms of a proportion of the total number of Member States .
That goes without saying .
Mr President , I want to congratulate Mrs Theato on her report .
Mr Schulz spoke about the five priorities based on the future of Europe and the ratification process .
To conclude , let me say that we do not yet have a fully @-@ fledged fledged European model for innovation , but what is clear is that it must be rooted in a well @-@ orches@@ trated orches@@ trated , concrete , strong and joint public / private effort .
We must bear in mind that times change and the standards change with them .
We will support that reform .
Even in my own country I can see some types of crime which we can see also in other existing Member countries .
Our Parliament will be present at a crucial time for the review of the Human Rights Council , as the global ful@@ cru@@ m for respect of human rights , the universal periodic review of all UN members , the independence of its experts or so @-@ called called special procedures , and the enhanced role for civil society participation .
We in Parliament will say &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; to new taxes but &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; to more taxes .
I believe that the work done by the Union improving the integrity of the electoral process is vital .
I would respectfully suggest that we have much more hope of building Europe in the direction we would wish if we do so on the basis of our hopes and dreams , rather than simply our mem@@ ories and our past achievements .
Sub@@ si@@ dies to farmers , selecting appropriate seed , irrigation , micro @-@ finance finance for small farmers , establishing food cooperatives and other rural investments transformed the agricul@@ tures of these countries .
Remember that the problem for both Germany and France began because of the budget relax@@ ations , the tax cuts and public spending increases introduced between 1999 and 2002 .
However , I hope that this cooperation will bear fruit .
Fe@@ w believed the UK would be able to achieve the final compromise given the sometimes diam@@ et@@ ri@@ cally opposed positions taken by the 25 EU Member States on this issue .
We cannot take action in every area of the world : we have to prioritise .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Thank you for that follow @-@ up up question .
Despite the many positive aspects of the report , I will vote against in the light of the above comments .
What we do not want is to line up the Commission head to to@@ e and find out that all that is left is inconsistency .
I hope the Telec@@ ommuni@@ cations Council meeting on 27 June next will have the wisdom and foresight to support these innovative proposals from the European Parliament .
That must be welcomed by everyone .
. If the honourable Member is referring to World Trade Organization talks , a framework agreement involving both the United States and the European Union , which essentially got the trade talks back on track , was reached back in 2003 .
That is better done by other regimes regulating various industries , and we have a good regulatory regime in most of our industries in the European Union now .
With that in mind , I have one doubt and it involves a difference with what Mr Medina Ortega has just said .
I believe that the European Union is on the right track in strengthening relations with Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
We must establish a system which is fair and efficient , based on common standards and common principles .
I join with the other shadow rapporteurs in thanking him for his work .
That is why I , as PSE spokes@@ person this afternoon , speak in support of the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal and the Sterckx report on the need to establish a monitoring system for maritime traffic .
Worse still is the fact that this reality plays into the hands of extremists and fundamentalists whose goal is not peace but to continue the spiral of confrontation .
The other question was how much should be given to developing countries , as I understood it .
I say &amp; apos ; mistakenly &amp; apos ; because the European Union is about vision and a vast array of practical issues of great importance .
For me , I hope that you will vote in the spirit in which I have put before you what I am trying to do .
If they do not , the extre@@ mes gain traction on the political process .
In order to further stimulate and facilitate the involvement of potential stakeholders , the Commission intends to adopt another communication .
A number of honourable Members quite rightly raised the importance of the Balkans .
We support the motion put forward by the three major political groups because we believe that improvements need to be made , improvements are being made , but that those improvements will be encouraged by an EU @-@ wide wide approach to this whole matter .
Lastly , I turn to the issue of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean , raised by Mr Sturdy .
Rather than simply d@@ wel@@ ling on the neg@@ atives - of which we have heard many this morning - we are looking for greater political leadership in terms of the sort of Europe we want to create .
The Lisbon Treaty puts the Parliament on an equal footing with the Council as colegislator accounting for some 95 % of legislative procedures .
It is a gru@@ dging package of too little , too late .
I think it is important that we say : yes we are ready to support you , but you should also open up your economy and integrate into the global economy .
Let me say that I understand the general thrust of this report is to ensure that we prevent distortion of competition while achieving a fair and level playing field .
This does not automatically mean that every criticism should be accepted as valid .
Governments in these poor countries do not have the funds , even if it is only USD 10 for treating a patient .
Of course , it is vital to remark on the necessity of the Nabucco project and its pan @-@ European European importance .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for their comments and the interesting debate .
We should indeed be able to go further .
That requires our total attention and determination to act .
When we last debated the situation in Iraq in early September , the world seemed on the brink of a unilateral military ad@@ venture led by the United States .
Mr President , on 4 and 5 December 2008 the European Parliament will discuss a set of proposals to modify Directive 2003 / 87 / EC concerning the emissions trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2013 @-@ 2020 2020 .
We are working on this .
With respect to her@@ ring , we agree that the tariff suspension should be turned into an annual quota , and we accept the recommendations for cod , Alas@@ ka poll@@ ack and sh@@ ri@@ mp .
I am very eager to continue in the European Commission , together with Parliament , to benchmark and measure how consumers are treated and how much Member States invest in this policy .
Therefore , we do not need it in the final text and I hope you will not insist on this point .
There have been some important achievements as a result of the negotiations with the Council .
Mr President , a common foreign and security policy that promotes Europe &amp; quot ; s values in the world and brings peace and security to our neighbours is what Liberals and Democrats strive for .
Let me say to the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office that I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of my Group to wish the Berlin Council well , and to say that we hope you will achieve the objectives of Agenda 2000 which are now more essential than ever .
I think all sides should aim to strengthen the moderate elements , and I therefore strongly recommend addressing these questions together , in order to find a sustainable solution acceptable to all .
I think this does not help , because it is not about who is better - government or opposition - or who is better supported by the Europeans , it is about Ukrainian citizens &amp; apos ; democratic future , and about Ukrainians having a strong , democratic and prosperous country .
We share the view that small @-@ scale scale coastal fishing has specificities that deserve to be taken into account . We have done it extensively , both in the rescue and restructuring schemes and in the EF@@ F .
Does the Commission agree that the immediate challenge is to ensure that the WTO lif@@ ts the restrictions on the export of cheap equival@@ ents of patented drugs to countries which have decided to override a patent but do not have the necessary manufacturing capacity ?
It is excellent .
Madam President , I would like to make a comment on the Minutes concerning the Oostlander report .
The Commission can adopt the compromise package , consi@@ sting of Amendments Nos 1 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 44 to 48 , provided all the other amendments are rejected .
When you say that you will continue with voluntary efforts , will you take into account the commitments from your own colleagues .
The next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 86 00@@ 86 / 2003 ) by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the amended proposal for a Council directive on the right to family reunification &amp; # 91 ; COM ( 2002 ) 2@@ 25 - C5 @-@ 0220 0220 / 2002 - 1999 / 02@@ 58 ( CNS ) &amp; # 93 ; .
Those principles and values are not negotiable and that must be clearly understood by all those who belong to the EU and by those wishing to join .
If you want to drive forward both agendas you need to support both , because it is both that will drive us forward to having an enlarged and a reformed European Union .
In any case , we are working closely with governments and social partners in all the applicant countries because some of them are having to start from scratch and there are great problems with the functioning of social dialogue .
Mr President , I present the annual report on the work of the Committee on Petitions .
in writing . - The EU is confronted with a major economic , financial and social crisis that affects us all , men and women .
Secondly , the institutionalised channels of communication with national authorities are insufficient .
They are on the streets and there is violence , and frankly this can only get worse .
Our position is very clear .
The European Investment Fund needs to be expanded , resources ought to go to TENs and to small businesses and the idea of a Delors White Paper needs to be made real and the structural funds have to be used more effectively .
Here the European Union has already demonstrated its strong commitment and , in the EU Aid for Trade strategy of October 2007 , has put in place a firm basis on which to make yet further improvements .
By that date I hope we will look back and say that we made the effort to help disabled people achieve , to enable them , and to make them real , whole people in the economies and communities in which they live .
Gra@@ dual integration of the former Yugoslav re@@ publics is crucial for stability in the Western Balkan region .
Our national and European interests , yes of course , but also the interests of the developing world - your approach , Commissioner , and ours .
So , thank you for a quick reaction .
Mr President , as we are allowed to ask another question , I would like to put this question to the Commissioner .
I would like to thank the honourable Member for his suggestion .
It has taken some time to organise this g@@ et@@ together .
However , it is important that we have these discussions and have them on a frank basis .
We , the Parliament , have no formal rule in relation to agreements like this .
Our engagements at country level mean that we now know better what to do than we did some years ago .
It is very concerned to make sure that it can get access to this sugar at the same time as we are reducing and reforming the sugar regime .
It is essential to find a balance between the needs of the fishing industry , the management of resources and the needs of the people who make their living from fishing and its associated industries .
Mr President , I voted against this report by Mr Oostlander , and I am very pleased indeed that Parliament has rejected it by a decisive two to one vote .
However , as soon as the consequences of the financial crisis hit Europe , the situation deterior@@ ated drastically .
That is where I believe we can leverage our interest and leverage our commitment most benefici@@ ally .
What is more , we need to move faster than is being proposed by the European Commission and the Council .
As Members will be aware , Eurostat does not produce data , but manages data provided by the national statistical systems .
One of them is the involvement of local authorities in cross @-@ border border cooperation , because we need strong regional cooperation in the South Caucasus ; then the issue of the accession of Azerbaijan to the WTO .
The Commission learned from the intense debate on this issue during the negotiations on the Sixth Framework Programme .
I cannot summar@@ ize that report now because there is not enough time but I wish to make one or two points .
The Commissioner mentioned blind people : the European B@@ lin@@ d Union - part of the European Disability Forum , the representative body of disabled people - wants us to give priority to organisations of disabled people .
That is what we are talking about , that is why we are working ahead and that is why it was very important that the Commissioner was here tonight .
On the contrary .
As Mrs Schroedter said , there was a unanimous vote in the Committee on Regional Policy but I think she would also admit that was as a result of very substantial amendments tabled by many political groups , and , indeed , we have much more work to do in this area .
For these reasons we were unable to support many of the amendments put forward and indeed we were disappointed that many amendments were given the support .
I know the Commissioner &amp; quot ; s heart is in progressing Article 13 , but what Mrs Ž@@ dan@@ o@@ ka &amp; quot ; s report states , very importantly , is that we need comprehensive legislation and we need to implement the Ra@@ cial Equality Directive and Employment Directive and make them mean something , rather than leave them unim@@ pl@@ emented .
Regarding the lack of additional resources for EDF funding to ACP countries , we would be happy to do more , but the Commission does not decide on the budget for the EDF . EU Member States do that .
We are not , however , aiming at producing a safe cigarette , since such a product cannot exist , but simply to reduce the most dangerous product constituents .
Mr President , I would like to make a short comment regarding nuclear plants in third countries that are very close to EU borders .
We have strengthened the GFCM to be able to use it as a tool to achieve common standards , and we are working to establish a regional advisory council for the Mediterranean , which will work further in this direction .
in writing . - Several groups agreed on this text that basically recalls Parliament &amp; apos ; s determination to fight terrorism and organised and transnational crime , and , at the same time , its firm belief in the need to protect civil liberties and fundamental rights , including the rights to privacy , inform@@ ational self @-@ determination determination and data protection .
But make no mistake , this report is also a deeply political one and it is a call to arms , because the fact is that this report demonstrates the urgent need for a complete revolution in the way we run our economies .
It is important that our actions in the Commission and in Parliament are targeted on the areas where the problems are .
There is increasingly a European single market for the free movement of stolen goods : cars , for example ; illegal services - prostitution ; di@@ rty capital waiting to be laun@@ dered in other Member States ; illegal immigrants smugg@@ led in by organized criminal gangs .
I have to underline once again that we need a more efficient decision @-@ making making process in the area of justice and home affairs in the European Union , and not only in that area .
By backing this report the Parliament will shape the debate , set the agenda , and I would invite the Commissioner to use our ideas to inform his proposals on CAP reform when he publ@@ ishes them in November this year .
Social housing is a key tool for active social and economic inclusion policies in the European Union .
This is very alarming because it showed that there was much unwillingness within the Council to accept the democratic will of Parliament : it obviously hoped that if it asked us enough times it would get the answer it wanted .
I welcome the new Commission &amp; apos ; s commitment to continuing this fund which provides people with a &amp; apos ; hand up &amp; apos ; as opposed to a &amp; apos ; hand out &amp; apos ; following redundan@@ cy .
The new provisions on civil protection , which entrust the Union with the task of promoting consistency in international civil protection work , will allow us to make our international action even more effective in the future .
Last November the Commission published a feasibility study setting out 16 points on which the country needed to make significant progress before a recommendation could be made to the European Council to start negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement .
We are also going to discuss innovation in the other part of the European Council .
This should be seen not only as the cynical pl@@ oy it is , coming from forces not in the least bit interested in facing up to the realities of climate change , but also as short @-@ sighted sighted in the extreme .
We ask for the support of the European Parliament and the Commission to achieve recognition of Catalan as an official language .
We favour close cooperation between Member States but also in the context of a global approach to the war on terror .
I mean the compromise by which it is understood that the vital national interests of a Member State will not be over@@ ruled by a majority vote in Council .
Therefore , essential jobs in the processing industries in what are clearly fisheries @-@ dependent dependent areas are put at risk .
It has been intergovernmental bodies that have been dealing with this so far , as well as national authorities .
However , the Russians think that democratic change can best be promoted by involving Belarus more in the international community .
During the debates preceding the adoption of Regulation ( EC ) No 10@@ 60 / 2009 , your rapporteur stressed the need for EU @-@ wide wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies &amp; apos ; products and integrated supervision of them .
in writing . - We ought to prepare for the changes set to take place in 2009 with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the European elections as they will have a major impact on the budget .
Our work remains rooted in the three building stones of prosperity , solidarity and security , with a continued emphasis on jobs and growth , in line with the Lisbon Strategy .
. Mr President , to bring the text into line with the Treaties , we would prefer the wording &amp; apos ; EU outermost regions ad@@ jacent to the European continent &amp; quot ; .
We feel there is room for improvement , for example on witness protection , and we would like to see improvement there as well .
Paragraph 1 of the recommendations of this report refers to the &amp; apos ; o@@ ft @-@ stated stated commitment &amp; apos ; by the Turkish authorities &amp; apos ; to democracy and Europe &amp; apos ; .
Mr President , I should like to begin by taking the opportunity of wishing Mr Spencer well in the future and expressing the hope that his considerable abilities can be put to good use .
Could I ask the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , whom I very much welcome - she has added a lot of colour to this fairly sombre Chamber - whether she believes that these proposals will come into force during the Austrian presidency ?
It is a very important piece of legislation which I hope will be adopted .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Van Hecke on this report .
The EU @-@ US US summit on 20 June will focus on three global themes : promoting democratic governance and human rights around the world , increasing economic prosperity for our citizens and champi@@ oning security and development .
It is a settlement that entren@@ ches what is truly important , it discards what is not , and strengthens the capacity of the Union to act effectively abroad and inside the Member States .
The issue of Greece raises very important issues , not just in terms of financial stability , but also in terms of social commitment and in terms of the political determination of the European Union .
We would really like that answer .
Lastly , we have taken a slight departure from the norm and are recommending that the 220 Council posts are not approved until we have received a satisfactory explanation on a number of points which are listed in our amendment .
We will report back to the European Parliament within the shortest possible time .
Furthermore , despite some sympathy with amendments 6 , 9 , 14 and 15 , the Commission considers that reopening these issues might endanger the whole compromise .
rapporteur . - Mr President , before highlighting a few elements of this elaborate report on the role of culture in the EU &amp; apos ; s external actions , I want to sincerely thank my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education for their constructive collaboration and for unanimously adopting our joint work in the committee vote .
Finally , we reserved the right to make supplementary proposals after the outcome of the interinstitutional discussions which will commence formally in the early months of next year .
I would like to thank the rapporteurs , the committee chairs , the President and the members of the Conciliation Committee , and all the individual Members of Parliament who have brought their commitment and expertise to bear .
Nevertheless , the political debates , the conservative attacks on human rights are alarming and they clearly underline the fact that the fight for women &amp; apos ; s rights is far from over .
However , we are at the stage of consulting and taking stock of the situation in the region and also considering ideas for this strategy .
Reducing the level of irregular payments further will therefore require the continuing improvement of supervisory and control systems and , where appropriate , the simplification of rules and regulations .
We are trying in our work therefore to make distin@@ ctions within the general definitions that will assist local and national authorities in the design of infrastructure to enhance to the greatest possible extent the safety of road travel .
We should end government subsidies that incenti@@ vise tyranny , and we should always be a friend of those who want to work their way out of poverty , because with our help they will end world hunger .
The report in question is the report on the war in Kosovo .
Mr President , given the tragic nature of the disaster off the coast of Galicia and the other Member States which have since been affected by the oil tragedy , there is great solidarity and support in this House for our colleagues in Galicia .
We are all , of course , &amp; apos ; Europeans &amp; apos ; but most people would not recognise an actual citizenship of Europe as being superior to the citizenship of their own country .
It is the duty of Member States to make sure that the owners and operators of fer@@ ries are aware of their responsibilities for the safe passage of people and goods .
May I say that what we can do in the European Commission , the European Council and the European Parliament is something different .
It is very useful , therefore , that the report points to the danger of inappropriate national legislation in the field of Fair Trade .
So it is essential that we make every effort to get this intelligent means , in order to put into practice the policy proposed by the committee on energy efficiency .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I would say to the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office : At next week &amp; apos ; s European Council you must move forward discussions on the Lisbon Treaty .
This , like all other matters , should be the prerogative of independent , democratic nation states .
This action plan is an EU @-@ Ukraine Ukraine co @-@ production production and it will offer concrete objectives for the coming years .
Sev@@ enty per cent of Europe &amp; quot ; s GDP is now based on services .
Are we doing Parliament justice ?
Could I ask that this House move from making declarations to establishing an ad hoc committee so that we can prepare a common position for the European Union and the World Bank and then drive the Council and the Commission to adopt Parliament &amp; quot ; s position on this issue ?
Mr President , on a point of order , I endorse the remarks that have just been made , but could I also suggest that , if there is any question of this Joint Parliamentary Assembly going ahead somewhere else and the banned Zimbabwean ministers still being there , it should be recommended that Members of this House do not join in that Assembly for as long as those ministers are present .
This will enable consumers , workers and insu@@ rers to be safeguarded by effective European regulations that can be automatically applicable across the Member States .
We have therefore asked for each institution to present a strategy setting out how it sees the impact of enlargement on its services .
How are we going to come back to it ?
So do not think that the Commission wants to do that . It is certainly not the case .
We need to look at that in the context of social cohesion overall , because it has implications for the gap between rich and poor .
I regret that in their contributions neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to make an acknowledgement of that sacrifice .
I hope that it will not be long delayed .
Nevertheless , some problems remain in a limited number of countries mainly because of their reluctance to comply with full harmonisation .
That may not be the politically correct answer , but it is a realistic one from sensible nation states , were they able to take those decisions .
This has to be addressed .
- After the vote on Amendment 51 :
Can I say through you , Mr President , to Mr Ceyhun that , as a non @-@ German German speaker , I am extremely grateful for the briefing notes that he has sent me in German , from which I will make my contribution this evening .
This crisis shows that a successful conclusion is more urgent than ever .
Several points raised in the report have already been taken into account by the Commission .
Members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission have worked well to develop a meaningful and practical report which will deliver more transparency in the legislative process .
Law @-@ abiding abiding citizens have learned to live in fear ; many have been permanently threatened in their daily lives .
It will be crucial in creating the single market .
Is there a clear internal market dimension because - remember - the legislation which we have already put on the table was all on the internal market legal basis .
The favourite tactics of its opponents have been terrorism against the state .
One of the things we agreed in the committee was that active inclusion should not be replacing social inclusion , that wider field of feeling that you have a role to play in society .
We obviously hope that happens , and the sooner the better , but we have not yet got that proposal off the ground .
But I am sure that there are many Member States which probably see a possible opportunity to engage in some protectionist measures , but I would say two things on that .
That concludes the summary of the Commission view of the proposed amendments .
I will of course ensure that the whole Commission is made familiar with your ideas and your positions .
Mr President , public transport is important to all our local communities .
It is despicable and it is cowardly .
There is also good news there .
Some@@ one also made reference to the fact that some Member States are increasing their own taxation , increasing VAT to pay for this .
We do not deny the importance of these agreements , but we believe that if we are expend@@ ing European taxpayers &amp; quot ; money , whether for targeted assistance or in relation to fishing rights , we should know exactly how this money is being expend@@ ed .
That means no more &amp; apos ; rights for disabled people &amp; apos ; , but &amp; apos ; equal rights for disabled people &amp; apos ; .
I can say , however , that this whole area is being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference .
The Commission always endeavours to answer Parliament &amp; quot ; s questions to the best of its abilities .
I would respectfully suggest that if he is concerned about and desi@@ r@@ ous of a thorough answer , then that rather v@@ indicates the point that I sought to make in terms of the need for EU heads of mission to prepare a very thorough statement in terms of what should inform the European Union &amp; apos ; s decision @-@ making making process .
I cannot , therefore , accept Amendments Nos 37 , 72 and 109 on the total budget for the programme .
There is no other mechanism for challenging this and I believe it has to be dealt with by Parliament as a whole .
This could create economies of scale and increase the effectiveness of services .
rapporteur . - Mr President , excuse me , but do I have two and a half or five minutes ?
Mr. President , I am voting in favour of this report today .
This relates to the previous question by Mr Turmes as well and the answer you gave to that in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the EU .
We need to encourage our Parliament to look at these issues in technical detail in the future so that we have equality and solidarity between the sexes .
Saf@@ e toys are a must and the EU should and is leading the way when it comes to safety concerns .
I would vote against Amendment No 12 .
Since this is an open dialogue between us , I should like to raise a couple of points where the Commission &amp; quot ; s views differ from the report .
It is a very depressing feature of the availability of cheaper cigarettes that it encourages young people to smoke - and especially young fem@@ ales now who are beginning to smoke .
That has to be an integral part of our discussion this afternoon .
Palestinian reconciliation , and a government representative of the aspirations of the Palestinian people , is more necessary than ever .
We have the knowledge .
Bri@@ dging this gap should be one of the key institutional discussions over the coming years .
Con@@ sider the facts .
I think we can all agree that despite recent positive developments , the situation concerning women &amp; apos ; s rights in Turkey needs to be improved .
Therefore I ask you to take this matter to the Bureau to investigate the possibility as to whether one should accept oral amendments as in the case of the last speaker .
The conclusions of the recent WTO panels on cases brought by the US and Australia impose on us the obligation to open the Community scheme to direct applications and objections from individuals in third countries .
Mr President , with demands for containment of spending this was never going to be a very happy procedure and yet I want to congratulate the rapporteurs , Brinkhorst and Fabra Vallés , and also the Irish presidency , for having achieved what might seem to be the impossible , of meeting our long @-@ term term commitments and resolving the immediate problems of today .
It must try to understand because to refuse to do so will contribute to the likelihood that much worse lies ahead .
Our role , our duty and our responsibility , be it in world trade or in the United Nations , or even within our own development aid actions , should be to ensure , first and foremost , that when we speak about globalisation we place people at the centre of the debate .
I hope and trust that when the Commission brings forward the directive which I understand it is considering , there will be a clear assurance that the contributors towards these huge funds will be involved .
The more we anchor our partnership in shared respect for our common values , the more strongly we can act to resonate those values in the wider world .
He is right to raise this issue , because once we say yes definitively to Turkey and give it a date , how can we say no to Ukraine , Belarus and other countries which probably have more of their land@@ mass within Europe than Turkey does ?
Palestinian leaders must make clear day @-@ by by @-@ day day their unequivocal condemnation of and opposition to attacks on the innocent and violence in all its forms .
I intend to ensure that this paper covers GMOs .
Mr President , I would like to make two points .
It confirms at the same time how difficult it is to reach some sort of consensus on this complex issue .
But words are not enough .
In the short term , the Council must put its faith in Parliament and allow us greater legislative scrutiny .
Firstly , I would cite the common foreign and security policy where we have a much clearer definition of what we gained in the interinstitutional agreement .
We need a system of global governance which includes transnational regulation of the financial markets . Indeed , including a capacity to tax such institutions in a way which prevents them from playing one country off another .
It establishes a level playing field for the industry by covering all aspects from capture through to the market .
With regard to this last topic , I understand the concerns expressed by some Members who have tabled amendments making the case for proposals for daughter directives as of now to set new limit values for sources and environmental noise .
We have also stated that one should not sacrifice the rule of law for the sake of a better institutional equilibrium or vice versa .
It is surely a perfectly sensible question for the citizen to ask &amp; apos ; What happens if I vote no ? &amp; apos ; .
The European Union has taken a longstanding commitment to secure stability in the Western Balkans and , as the most influential supranational organisation of the continent , we need to convey a clear message and speak with one voice .
The significant body of European Court of Human Rights case @-@ law law provides an important incentive for the development of Russian law with regard to respect for human rights .
I am grateful to colleagues who have raised this question .
The ECJ ruling , in compliance with the philosophy of the internal market , was in favour of Mar@@ ks &amp; # 91 ; amp &amp; # 93 ; Spencer and the Commission fully supported that .
At this point in time I would just like to underline one thing from the point of view of the Presidency : we warmly suggest that first we discuss the substance and thereafter discuss the figures and the monies and the resources .
I think that having our deliberations in the open will also help people to make their own informed judgment of what is going on and of why we have so many important things on our agenda .
The directives that the Commission will propose this month take account of the three key points raised in Mrs Thors &amp; apos ; report .
And now , at long last , they have agreed .
Unfortunately , I have learned that sometimes it is simply impossible to meet all expectations .
I look forward to the fullest support from Parliament in dealing with this most important piece of legislation in the shortest possible timeframe .
In addition to the policy of target setting , the members of selection boards are reminded of the principles of equal opportunities to be taken into consideration in the selection of candidates .
At the moment this is all I can say .
That is why we will be opposing Amendment No 16 while supporting the rest .
in writing . - I voted in support of Mr Gi@@ e@@ rek &amp; apos ; s report on the Research Fund for Co@@ al and Ste@@ el .
The European Union continues to support any efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict .
Our committee and , indeed , our Group has been emphasising , since this new Parliament started last year , the need to encourage the development of small- and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises across the European Union .
On the other hand , we should avoid giving out discouraging messages to the applicant countries that are currently making great efforts to get themselves in shape to join the EU .
A large amount of national patent law is already aligned with the European Patent Convention and the Community Patent Convention of 1989 .
My colleague over there ( Mr Guy Verhofstadt ) referred to us as &amp; apos ; anti @-@ European European &amp; apos ; .
in writing . I voted for this report , which calls on the Commission to consider the proposal for a sector @-@ specific specific directive in the field of social services of general interest , given that they can &amp; apos ; t be associated with the rules governing commercial services in the EU .
An important change of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary has taken place and Commissioner Pin@@ he@@ iro has used that new vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary .
This was a roll @-@ call call vote on transparency and I voted against this .
I myself am not against taking economic sanctions , though I realize that this is a policy which is very difficult to sell within the European Union .
I hope that this will indeed happen .
That is the course we shall pursue and I am grateful to Parliament for its support for it .
It is certainly clear from some speeches we have heard in this House that the current system is not well understood either in some Member States &amp; apos ; administrations or in this House itself .
In fact in my first week in Parliament the leader of my group , Hans @-@ Gert Gert Pöttering , stood up and said , &amp; apos ; Nothing must be allowed to get in the way of European integration ; nothing must be allowed to get in the way of the European project &amp; apos ; .
This makes it even more imperative that action should be taken .
I believe a new Presidency coming into office - a new government - should at least look at this .
It is extremely important to move closer to reality .
At the same time the European defence industries remain strategically and economically important to the EU .
Pol@@ i Bor@@ tone Report ( A5 @-@ 03@@ 58 03@@ 58 / 2000 )
We recognise that there are choices to be made in how we try to develop our economies and that the pursuit of competition and more liberalisation is a mistaken path if we really want to make full use of the Lisbon Agenda .
Nevertheless , this policy is not yet reflected in the US approach to EU citizens .
It is important to emphasise the practical nature of this .
In the past twenty @-@ five five years the average growth rate for real GDP in the euro area has been between 2 and 2.5 % per year .
Rather it perpetu@@ ates hate , encourages yet more young Ara@@ bs to take up arms against Israel and it desta@@ bi@@ li@@ zes Israel &amp; apos ; s friendly Arab neighbours .
Thirdly , we want a reasonable and therefore a longer period of certainty in which renewable energy can continue to receive compensation for the external costs to society which its use avoids .
This will help us in achieving the Lisbon objectives .
Therefore , I hope that , under the guidance of our rapporteur , Thi@@ j@@ s Berman , we may find more time to have a thorough discussion on this matter and consider what is the best legal basis , namely , the proposal made by Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner Waldner .
The changes in China , including in the human rights area , may not be sufficient for us but are a good example and perhaps China can use its relations to promote some changes in North Korea .
The Commission is not sh@@ ying away from openly saying where , in our view , the limits are , but the Commission has been , and will remain , ready to discuss in a spirit of full transparency and cooperation all issues necessary to designing a strong and credible framework for the future of OLAF and a successful fight against fraud .
Taxation policy remains an exclusive competence of Member States and the proposed CCCTB , despite conten@@ tions from its proponents , seeks to undermine Member States &amp; apos ; competence in this area .
One is that we should somehow try to legislate , or to get Member States to legislate , for the 0.7 % of GNP contribution , as required by our commitment to the United Nations .
But could it be that each electorate has given priority to internal concerns , to matters that influence their everyday lives ?
This report should be examined by the Council and the European Parliament should be consulted on it .
The Commission proposes ; Parliament and the Council decide .
But there are some questions still outstanding .
The Commission has always taken a clear stance that it must ensure that a definition of vodka is compatible with EU law and fits the WTO context .
Such action , according to the Commission , would boost the EU economy by about 1.5 % of the GDP and free up an estimated EUR 150 billion for investment .
I am convinced that the new Commission is determined to achieve this change , which is needed for the success of future enlargement of the Union .
Since then , Madagascar has been troubled by unstable governments with threats of sec@@ ession and impe@@ ach@@ ment pun@@ ctu@@ ating a rough politics .
. Mr President , I will be very brief because any sentiments I express will largely echo the remarks that have been made with some passion and knowledge of the country by Members who have already spoken .
Maybe we , as a parliament , should change our tactics .
It is unfair for European consumers and it is unfair for producers in Europe , who are having to take on practices which , at the same time , are not being accepted , and are not practised , by producers in Brazil .
. I hope I do not disap@@ point the honourable Member , who has now joined us in the Chamber , with the answer that I can offer , but the Council has received no proposals from the Commission on this subject and it therefore has not addressed the issue .
This directive is even more objectionable from the UK perspective because , for the first time , it would make breach of patent a criminal offence punish@@ able by four years &amp; apos ; imprisonment or more ; not because the elected House of Commons thinks that it is necessary or wise but because the unelected EU Commission dictates it .
Therefore , when we talk about the Kyoto Protocol at Gen@@ o@@ a , it is very important that we are able to do so in a way which leads to action on climate change and not the collapse of what has been an extremely important effort by the international community to address a major change .
Last week , the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution on access to safe and legal abortion in Europe , which means that we care about women in Europe .
The last thing I want to say is about Turkey .
Mr President , may I say how happy I am to see the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office here .
I would also like to express our appreciation of the fact that Mr García ? Margallo y Marfil has decided not to re@@ table the amendments which played a role in the first reading of this proposal .
We have to be careful of that and we look to you to utilise your resources and skills in those areas .
We have already had the first reading in Parliament and I do not see any reason why they should not make progress .
Turning to Schengen , I agree with you - or most of you - who have said that Schengen is a fantastic achievement .
Amendment No 12 as currently drafted risks undermining the Commission &amp; apos ; s own powers to take measures when Member States take action that affects the functioning of the internal market .
We believe that the provisions of Article 3 ( a ) set a limit to what that comparative advertising might be and we also support the rapporteur in her proposal to delete Article 3 ( a ) 1 ( g ) because , although we understand the lobby which constantly emerges where particular stimulating agricultural products are concerned , there is enough protection already in the directive without that suggestion .
I would however like to make a few points .
It is clear that a just and lasting solution to the Israeli @-@ Palestinian Palestinian conflict is essential to the peace and stability of the entire region .
This will include those where provisions resulting from international agreements may be granted by publishing relevant documents and draft legal texts for meetings of the Customs Code Committee on the Europ@@ a website , so that traders and trade federations can make their views known to the Commission and the committee before a decision is taken .
For tactical reasons I would urge some caution as to how Members of Parliament pursue this issue .
There is also certainly scope for clarifying and streamlining the rules on when judgments delivered in abs@@ enti@@ a without the presence of the accused will be recognised , but this must not sh@@ ade into la@@ zy habits of not trying hard enough to inform the def@@ endant .
That is what we are aiming to achieve .
On the VAT question , I agree in substance with what the rapporteur has said .
They suggest that the added therapeutic value should be considered as a criterion for the authorisation of a medicinal product - alongside quality , safety and efficacy .
. The approach that I have adopted with the European Parliament and others who have raised concerns is to have those concerns and problems put on the table and into a document .
Mr President , I too am am@@ a@@ zed that Commissioner Monti , having had time to reflect on the discussions we had earlier this week at Question Time and having heard the strong feelings that the majority of the House - we , the mess@@ eng@@ ers of the people - have on this issue , is not prepared to rel@@ ent , even at this very late stage , and give us a more positive response .
I think we have already realised that the way to improve it , to make it more effective , is to make it more political .
First of all , let me recall that the euro is one of the major successes in Europe &amp; apos ; s history .
On the European Parliament section of the budget , we firstly welcome the fact there has been a marked change in attitude between the Bureau and the Budgets Committee .
That phrase would create difficulties and legal uncertainty , most particularly in Germany and the S@@ cand@@ inavian Member States .
I would like to comment on one amendment that we will propose for tomorrow .
As President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council I must be very careful in expressing my views because I have not had an opportunity to check whether all my 24 colleagues agree with my answers to some of the remarks made .
I would like to stress the central importance of continued and frequent dialogue between India and Europe on many issues that benefit from a shared approach - both at Council and Commission level , but also at parliamentary level - so I welcome the group that has been set up in the Indian Parliament , and I hope they will be coming to the European Parliament in the very near future .
I believe that this is a direction in which we must go but I would also like to make one additional point .
It will involve action to make education and training more relevant to young people &amp; apos ; s needs , encourage them to take advantage of EU grants to study or train in another country and overcome obstacles to entering and making progress in the labour market .
We are already two years past Lisbon , there are only eight more years to 2010 when we are to be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge @-@ based based economy in the world .
Thus a more systematic cooperation between the industry and the relevant contact points in the Member States could and should be encouraged .
I have indicated that we are sending the election assessment team shortly , which I hope will help us deal with the issues that honourable Members have raised in that context .
The directive can deliver it and I hope will do so .
It does need to be seen in that context .
Clearly there are many in this House who are quite open in their advocacy of a single foreign minis@@ try for Europe and the Galeote Quecedo report which was voted on today with its proposals for a permanent Community diplomatic service is , I am afraid , a step in this direction .
The main obstacles to progress in this regard had been the lack of agreement on the legal base .
The new powers granted this Parliament in the Lisbon Treaty gave you a greater role in that struggle and a greater imperative to govern responsibly .
I read about the important debate as to whether Europe should spend more on precision @-@ guided guided missiles , on special forces , on air @-@ lift lift capacity , on military telecommunications .
I should add that the European Court of Justice has stated in its judgment on C@@ ase 3@@ 76 / 98 that public health provides a legal basis in addition to and in association with its Article 95 .
We will not see a resolution to the problem at Montreal , nor under the current UK Presidency of the EU .
This dialogue , in accordance with EU policies , not only includes the Cuban authorities but also civil society and the democratic opposition .
Lastly , the British people , my constituents , will now understand that European solidarity has a tangible and practical meaning .
The Commission would point out that this proposal is based on the standard format used for all the European agencies , though there are ad@@ mittedly differences with this one .
An evaluation of the agreement by the Commission &amp; apos ; s services will be published very soon .
Commissioner , I echo the other sentiments - you have been a very good Commissioner in this area .
Most Members rightly emphasised the absolute necessity of combating corruption and crime and ensuring that the rule of law is reinforced in Montenegro .
You publicly stated that you supported that idea ; your President , President Barroso , publicly committed himself to such a horizontal directive .
Do@@ ing business elec@@ tron@@ ically is increasing rapidly both for companies and for consumers .
That is why I am able to accept the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur , as there are extra measures for perform@@ ers .
When we prepare our first annual report on the application of the charter in spring 2011 , I will pay particular attention to the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s report , and to Parliament &amp; apos ; s other fundamental rights activities .
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city .
We are the body with the political competence to take into account the substantial and professional work of the Court of Auditors .
The first amendment requires the Member States to ensure full implementation of the directive and the Member States and the Commission to execute controls on the implementation .
First of all , the report mentions rapid border intervention teams with the purpose of providing swift operational technical assistance to any Member State requesting it .
Not only will this bring good things for the people of these countries , but it will also strengthen the credibility of the European Union .
I have already alluded in my introduction to the question of transparency and the summary minutes asked for in the motion for a resolution .
The Commission strongly supports the political will to move ahead on this topic and the will of Parliament to move forwards as quickly as possible .
Allow me a few words on the controversial issue on which views were divided for a long time .
Our trade policy vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis China - the memorandum of understanding and even the agreed minutes - are aimed at establishing a sustainable future for the European textile and clothing industry , which is basically competitive .
Mr President , this question , as Mr Harbour will be aware , has direct relevance to the question raised by Mrs Theorin because we believe that amongst the many other justifications for making changes , as regards appraisal and the advance towards a more lin@@ ear career structure , will be to give fairer treatment to women officials , and indeed to make the Commission more attractive for the employment of women , particularly women who have family obligations .
There are people making mistakes in the voting . Please !
It is in the common interest of all the European institutions to reinforce each other in the service of the European project .
The Commission and Council share the responsibility for this situation and it is important that lessons are learned for the next round of appointments .
That is my approach in the report , which the Committee on Environment , Public Health and Food Safety strongly supported .
I am pleased that the Commissioner has welcomed many of the amendments that were made .
But at least the Commission has at last wo@@ ken up to this gi@@ g@@ antic and immediate threat .
At the same time , I stress that an ageing population is also a great opportunity and a promising market for new products and new services for healthy ageing and independent living .
At this juncture , I believe all efforts should be pooled and meetings that MEPs could have in Minsk with Belarusian parliamentarians , for example , would also be most useful .
That would have a considerable effect on the whole region .
Given their importance , it is vital that we all move together .
Hopefully , our work will shake the Council out of its inertia and trigger productive negotiations , allowing us to fulfil our objective of having a common European asylum system by 2012 and thus taking into consideration the hard work we have all put into this file .
Yet here we are trying to make public services obey a common set of EU rules .
It states that Pau@@ line Green , London North PSE , requested the House to delay the vote on the motions for resolution scheduled for voting on Wednesday at 12 noon .
The successful execution of this important task would not be possible without the help and cooperation of my fellow shadow rapporteurs or the members of the committee , my office and the secretariat .
The Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation must be based on agreement between the regime , the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities .
Firstly , this Constitution was prepared in an open and democratic way .
This will require serious investments to be made , a regulatory framework and , most of all , strong political will .
- Mr President , having voted for the Brantner report , I would like to use this opportunity to turn the Commission &amp; apos ; s and Council &amp; apos ; s attention to the need to reach a tripartite agreement on the modification of the stability instrument in the shortest possible time .
The Commission has reiterated what we have known since 19@@ 69 : the Commission &amp; quot ; s role is to defend the European Treaties , whether it be Article 49 , Article 21 , Article 95 or Article 99 .
Mr President , our rapporteur said of the CFP that its original problems are still largely present .
I agree with Mr O@@ z@@ dem@@ ir &amp; apos ; s recommendations and voted in favour of the report .
I am pleased at the range of measures that he has outlined .
Mr President , it is no secret that the Green / EFA Group does not share the majority view of Parliament over the outcome of the Doha meeting .
In the context of up to 50 % unemployment , the impact of those job losses is clearly disastrous .
We must ensure that we not only pay lip service to the disabled this year , but also give particular emphasis to those who cannot speak for themselves , and mostly that means the elderly disabled .
I know that the European Parliament is devoting particular attention to these two dossiers .
Without the existence of the elected European Parliament , there would have been a real danger that , if left to their own devices , the Commission and national ministers in the Council would have adopted this undesirable piece of legislation .
We support these actions and welcome the work of the high @-@ level level technical group on better regulation between Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
That is why my group is calling for support for Amendment No 70 to this report .
In doing so , it will pursue a comprehensive and balanced strategy .
We encourage those contacts and projects that are in line with international law , and we criticise when they are not in line with international law .
Mr President , our group voted in favour of this report . It is extremely important and we commend the European Parliament which played a very important role in the campaign to ban anti @-@ personnel personnel mines .
Will the Commissioner therefore finally confirm his unequivocal support for this directive and his willingness to work with us in Parliament for its speedy and smooth transition ?
It is with regret that colleagues on the right diff@@ ered .
Madam President , on behalf of my group I have been asked to comment particularly on the E@@ is@@ ma report .
Furthermore , in order to provide the right incentives for Member States to tackle fiscal imbalances , the functioning of the excessive deficit procedure could be improved by speeding up the individual procedures , in particular , with regard to Member States in repeated breach of the pact .
Bri@@ dging the gap between the European Union and its citizens has become more urgent than ever .
Please convey that to the Commissioner please , as she is not listening at the moment .
I believe quite strongly that this offers huge opportunities for the European Union to move out of its problems with the financial crisis .
However , it would seem to me that neither would the benefits of a merged market , at least from the Euronext side .
Contrary to the main thrust of this report , however , I do not believe that this should mean replacing the strong links between the United States and individual member states ( Britain in particular ) with an &amp; apos ; EU @-@ US US partnership &amp; apos ; .
I particularly welcome the decision to create a Peace @-@ Building Building Commission as well as the inclusion of the concept of human security in the official UN framework .
I urge them , even at this late stage , to vote against these amendments , to vote for jobs , to vote for reform and to vote for Barcelona .
I regret that it is very difficult to accept any of the amendments , mainly for formal reasons , which I would like to explain .
There are a number of areas where we need to update and modernise the social legislation we have adopted in the past .
in writing . - I would like to echo the admiration expressed during the debate in respect of the courage of the people of both Tunisia and Egypt in expressing their discontent and disappointment with their respective regimes .
But already now we can conclude that racism and xenophobia are still persistent phenomena in the European Union and that they affect the lives of members of ethnic minorities .
I hope the Council and Commission will ensure that this Parliament and its committees are fully involved and informed of the whole situation .
Without a doubt , the overarching goal of our dealings with Burma is the transition towards democracy .
The programme is essential for a digital Europe and for the European economy and for our society as a whole .
As far as the Treaty of Amsterdam is concerned , it is possible to think along the lines of whether we could do something preparatory for the new Treaty .
But I also expect their help in coming up with a decision @-@ making making process with Qu@@ ali@@ fied Maj@@ ority Vo@@ ting ( QMV ) , because otherwise we are stuck .
The solution , we are told , is firstly to abuse the existing rules such as Article 1@@ 22 of the Treaty , which was never intended for the b@@ ail@@ outs that it has been used to pay for - my hope is that some country will have the courage to challenge this in the European Courts - and to impose more limitations on our Member States , which in reality means constra@@ ining the democratic choice of many of the electorates .
I hope the Commission will think again about the acceptability of Amendments Nos 14 , 15 , 17 and 19 on the statute , concerning the inclusion of the consideration of employment effects in the case of a merger , transfer or conversion involving an EC@@ S , because I think they are entirely justifiable .
Safety must be a priority and we all understand that if we are to have equal precautions throughout the Member States , we need a variety of measures in place which have not so far been instituted .
I hope sincerely that at all levels we can create tangible proposals which can realistically result in some meaningful progress in this battle .
This important step should be applauded , but at the same time , we cannot overlook the fact that China holds the record for the highest number of death penalties , the true number of which we do not even know , due to a lack of transparency and the fact that certain people are qualified as non @-@ people people .
By the way , it is also investigating , with the European Investment Bank , possible ways to take advantage of their funds and support the funding of civil engineering .
At this critical juncture , our message is very clear : there is a need for negotiations ; all action threatening a two @-@ State State solution must cease ; and imposing law and order and fighting terrorism are important .
Parliament will know of the targeted sanctions that we have introduced - sanctions which are focused on the leading members of this particularly nasty and deeply corrupt regime , on their travel and on their assets .
The European Commission has also pursued social development objectives in regional , bi @-@ regional regional and bilateral arrangements .
The Commission is ready to use all available means to ensure the correct application of EU law , including launching infringement procedures whenever such action is necessary .
There are real problems there .
We should accordingly be very careful not to infl@@ ame the situation in any way .
Prime Minister , in two weeks &amp; apos ; time , your presidency of the European Union will come to an end .
The deep state is not under the democratic control of that government .
We want economic growth , because many people are still in need , but without increasing the use of natural resources and with less environmental impact .
On the basis of indicators and benchmarks , as I have said before , both parties will jointly evaluate the results of this policy and where appropriate will make the necessary adjustments .
That is not the focus of our discussion now .
Now that is how we ensure safety .
We have to make sure that when national parliaments are setting their national budgets there is a feeling that there is a democratic body at a European level over@@ seeing the monetary policy that is being set in the name of the citizens of the European Union , on behalf of the whole European Union .
It would be entirely wrong for anyone to think that the Commission &amp; apos ; s decisions over the last week were based on anything other than the scientific facts and the advice given to me and the standing committee which led us to conclude that our decisions were the right ones .
The actions taken by individual Member States are especially important .
So I would like to highlight the part played by the European Union in helping to create contact , dialogue and reconciliation in Northern Ireland , which thankfully , though still fragile as a peace process , is still holding .
So I can assure you , Mrs Auroi , that I am concerned about these issues .
I am more than slightly concerned when I hear the Minister talking about the need to re @-@ evaluate evaluate the European Convention on Human Rights .
We must now gather support from the international community for those measures .
However , legislation alone is not enough to counter discrimination effectively .
While the European economy is performing strongly , we must also ensure that key social problems such as drug abuse are comb@@ ated in a society .
We know that the crucial thing that is lacking is a will to do that &amp; apos ; everything &amp; apos ; .
Refer@@ enda are very important , but in the case of a single constituency , where you ignore almost 50 % in a Member State who may vote against it , this is not democratic .
Apart from the killing and woun@@ ding of sl@@ ave workers , the general human rights situation is appalling .
And also we get clear involvement of the European Investment Bank in this area .
The necessary police and judicial cooperation must be forthcoming at European level , and urgently so .
Instead , it is crucially important to focus ESF support on the vulnerable groups who suffer the most as a result of the economic downturn .
I therefore urge this House to reject the report in its entirety .
The European Union is the world &amp; quot ; s largest provider of reinsurance services .
It seems to me that the Member States are mu@@ ddling their way through to creating an agency that will not have within its responsibilities the very subject area where EU action is most likely to cause problems with regard to human rights .
That , however , is another issue that has to be borne in mind in determining the protection of human health in respect of animals , animal health and animal welfare .
There was a misunderstanding here , I feel , because what we are talking about here ...
Now I see democracy failing here in Europe .
So I wholeheartedly agree with the establishment of the public @-@ private private partnership arrangement to ensure that the monies and the extra revenues which are created because of the single market within the European Union are put back into the European Union rather than allowing money which is invested in pension funds and so on to be invested in countries outside the European Union , which means that the Union as a whole loses all that money .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I am trying to organise my speech in the best way to touch upon all the important issues , and I am very thankful for your very valuable input in this debate .
To conclude I would like to thank European Parliament for the detailed consideration it has given to this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been contributed .
It is crucial that governance is improved at an institutional level .
This has to happen in the presence of the Commission .
By voting &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; to REACH this week we can start to implement the legislation to get the agency up and running .
We have a duty to our own consumers and to our farmers to maintain the stability of national agricultural markets and protect them from international price fluctuations and to uphold the models of production and land use which are typical features of European agriculture .
This Commission communication and Barbara Weiler &amp; apos ; s excellent report address the need to mo@@ derni@@ ze and improve social protection in Europe to meet these challenges and to provide a social model which respects human dignity .
On the contrary , the EU is more divided now .
The Commission is at least accountable to this Parliament .
I compliment the Commission for even trying to do so .
We also appreciate that by deciding to close the Chernobyl plant before the end of 2000 , Ukraine lived up to the commitment it made under the international agreement signed with the governments of the of the G7 countries and with the European Commission .
I would like some clarification on that point .
in writing . - President , I have voted on the J@@ OR@@ D@@ AN CI@@ Z@@ EL@@ J report in a way in which I believe was the most responsible regarding Europe &amp; apos ; s future energy concerns .
Equally , we must push all Member States to adopt a minimum living income for all .
I believe we have to reconsider as a House the use of former Members of the European Parliament in such delegations .
This is an important subject and those responsible in this House should put that on the agenda for fast track debate , so Members of this House can debate it and the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s view can go to that conference for consideration .
Finally , I would just like to say that the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s amendments calling for greater self @-@ evaluation evaluation and participation of stakeholders inser@@ ts a valuable co@@ g in the evaluation machine .
Mr Posselt is absolutely right .
The Commissioner has the support of the European Parliament in pushing forward Altener II .
There should be no wall of silence , there should be no culture of impunity .
We have to make it absolutely clear that violence is not a short@@ cut to anything , and that if people follow leaders who espouse violence they are following those leaders into a future of poverty and criminality - not a future with the rest of Europe .
However , as the rapporteur makes clear in his report , a number of bodies , including the European Commission , have not adhered to recommendations and regulations on access to public documents .
This , however , should not be seen as compensation , because the fishing industry will be the eventual beneficiaries of the new policy but as a financial incentive to make the transition .
Despite the reservations of members of the Group of the European People &amp; quot ; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , as shadow rapporteur I have proposed that the report should be approved , for if used responsibly and sensibly by the players in this field , it can help to level out the differences in living standards , and raise standards in the poorest societies .
However , given recent events in Gaza ; involving the brutal and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians , and , the lev@@ elling of Gaz@@ an infrastructure , effectively ob@@ liter@@ ating billions in European development aid ; In the context of the decision by the European Parliament last December to defer the upgrading of EU relations with Israel ; and considering the continuing disregard for UN resolutions and the extension of settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem ; and further considering my own recent visit to Gaza where I saw first hand that Israel simply has@@ n &amp; apos ; t lifted the si@@ ege of Gaza to allow crucial humanitarian aid to pass ;
in writing . - The EU and Member States face one of their biggest challenges with regard to ensuring adequate and sustainable pension systems in Europe .
On the contrary , I would support those who have said that not only did they have a coherent delegation to lead but that the practical arrangements for us - the largest Parliamentary delegation which had ever attended international trade talks - were to our mutual benefit .
If the EU is to secure the long @-@ term term future of its agricultural areas in a territori@@ ally and environmentally balanced fashion , we have to respect that .
I welcome the Romanian Government &amp; apos ; s decision to establish an international committee to resolve this delicate issue .
Discussions amongst elected parliamentarians on such issues is essential .
. Mr President , I am conscious that your direction to honourable Members also , no doubt , includes the Presidency , so I shall endeavour to keep my answers as brief as is appropriate , given the range of questions that we have been asked .
It is important also that the EU engages constructively with Belarus where , notwithstanding our differences , we must engage positively in areas of mutual interest , like border controls , and in order to encourage reforms and democracy and discourage self @-@ isolation isolation by that government .
We should be pro @-@ active active and taking a lead .
We need to lead by example .
I am sure that the European Parliament will give its support to these efforts by the Commission .
This was the most complex and delicate report for us but we managed well .
They are desperate , dangerous criminals who need to be brought to book .
My own group , which is of divided opinion on the matter , has a minority who intended to vote against paragraph 8 , and did so .
I can , however , confirm that all Member States have national plans .
For instance , the Council could decide , by changing its rules of procedure , to meet in public when dealing with legislation .
Unfortunately , this was exactly what we had expected .
In 1997 the Commission presented a proposal to the Council to extend the scope of this regulation to workers who are third @-@ country country nationals .
As I have already said , the Commission will be presenting a major proposal on controls shortly .
Pl@@ ant protection products play an important role in agriculture , hor@@ ti@@ culture , forestry and gar@@ d@@ ening .
They suffer politically , they suffer economically , they suffer in their daily lives .
It is against that background that we are pleased to hear that the Commission recognises that the times are changing .
What the UK is doing in relation not only to the UK coast but also in relation to the EU as a whole is completely unacceptable .
But , again , we must see if this new government is able to sustain that progress .
I congratulate the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office for the commitment made by this Presidency to Parliament .
It would lead to serious problems of private and public sector debt de@@ fault that would spill over across the whole euro zone .
Of course , this is not the final stage , as our talks on the topic and the text will continue .
I guess that a lot of that is , maybe , as I suspected .
This debate is particularly opportune as key decisions are to be taken only four weeks from now at the sixth conference of the parties to the Convention on Climate Change - the so @-@ called called COP6 - in The Hague .
This is very much on the agenda and in our financial perspective .
Mr President , the Commission &amp; apos ; s first report on the implementation of the 1993 money laundering directive has pointed to vast differences in the way the legislation is applied by the Member States .
We hope it will be adopted on an annual basis .
So if Commissioner Schreyer could reply to that , I would be grateful .
Moreover , there is an overall reflection process on the future of the common agricultural policy .
The estimated 2 500 lives a year that eCall could save throughout Europe is significant and therefore it needs to be taken seriously as a means of cur@@ bing high levels of road fa@@ ta@@ lities .
Mr President , once again I would like to thank Parliament for this opportunity to respond to some of the questions and for the discussion we had .
There is good support for this legislation across Europe , across parties in the committee and from a whole range of NGOs across Europe .
This is something that should be included in the directive in order to ensure harmonisation .
Let me thank you once again for the excellent cooperation with all the rapporteurs , with Ms G@@ ur@@ mai , with our Chair , Ms Wallis , with Mr H@@ ä@@ f@@ ner and Mr Lamassoure .
It requires careful planning , training and not least funding .
These five headline targets pin@@ point objectives which people can relate to , and show that the European Union is le@@ ver@@ aging reform in areas that everybody knows are important .
Mr President , I feel that none of us must lose sight of the fact that the European Union is seen as irrelevant and un@@ responsive to the crises in our world today .
This fits in with the EU action plan and the forthcoming summit in Stockholm .
In relation to that , there will be an amendment moved by Mr Tillich , the rapporteur , agreed by Mr W@@ ai@@ deli@@ ch , which our group will be supporting .
I believe it can , and I believe that the European Union will play a key role in making Seoul a success .
The long and dark years of suffering , however , did not d@@ amp@@ en our aspirations to build a stable , democratic and prosperous Afghanistan .
If I asked the plenary here to take a decision on that , I think that the right to fail would not be hampered .
In some ways , for very good reasons , the Council showed a good degree of diligence in its considerations of this proposal .
Thank you very much for your speech today as well .
Like Hélène Flautre , I would like to ask you to come to the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs to explain to us what the situation is and what action the Commission intends to take .
We need to bear that in mind .
The Commission and Parliament are not the only two players in the current legislative process .
Mr President , I have to say that on this particular measure , I voted against .
May I suggest to the Commissioner that this is a remarkable admission to make .
Moreover , the focus on decentralisation in this communication exchange is pertinent : regions vary dramatically across the EU and local authorities are at@@ tuned to regional needs and issues of local importance .
It is a compromise resolution and obviously it contains elements that many of us wish were not in it , and indeed it excludes elements that many of us wish were in it .
Therefore , I agree with the rapporteur who strongly supports the amendment of certain elements of Regulation ( EC ) No 12@@ 15 / 2009 in order to permit the extension of its validity to 31 December 2015 and I voted &amp; apos ; in favour &amp; apos ; .
We in Parliament must also be vigilant in seeing that the Commission carries out this task .
In conclusion I would like to point out that , once again , the negotiation process has benefited very much from the close collaboration between Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
I am confident that with the due institutional framework which will fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative process - I refer to the codecision procedure - we will be able to match this high level of ambition .
It certainly should not be allowed to be hi@@ jac@@ ked by those extremists who will never recognise that peace in the Middle East , as elsewhere , will only come by negotiation and not by the bullet and the bomb .
We regret , however , that certain divergences and procedural issues are hampering the rapid adoption of this proposal .
To strike the right balance between these two justified concerns we need a transparent process , a wide dialogue and strong political leadership .
If we are to use these opportunities and to take the steps needed , we must be more active , we must look for creative solutions to the institutional questions , we must continue and intensify dialogue with our citizens about where Europe is going next .
in writing . I will be supporting this resolution .
Firstly , the Commission agrees that the Roma issue is one of the most important strategic challenges that Europe faces and , at the same time , it provides one of the most promising opportunities for the continent .
I am in favour of everything that will en@@ li@@ ven our parliamentary discussions here , so this possibility for parliamentarians to interrupt one another in a civilised way and to speak like that is a good idea .
Mr President , the reason I was absent was because I went to a selection procedure which I subsequently failed and I will probably not be a Member of Parliament in future .
Ass@@ essing a country &amp; apos ; s readiness for candidate status is one of the most important institutional duties that the Commission undertakes .
More needs to be done , but a lot has been done and we must recognise that .
In Romania , for instance , there is a large Hungarian @-@ speaking speaking minority , whose rights must be fully recognised before Romania enters the European Union as a way of recognising internal diversity .
I live in hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament and act accordingly .
. I support the Conciliation Agreement which has been agreed by the European Parliament and the European Council on the Framework Directive on Water .
Is the Commission aware of the fact that the world Ch@@ o@@ col@@ ate Manu@@ factu@@ rers Association concluded an agreement back in 2001 specifically to deal with this issue ?
The proposed direct aid , when there is a re@@ valuation of over half a percent , must be received by the farmers and not too late to help them .
It was a decision taken independently by the Irish Parliament and will be carried out independently by the Irish people .
For this , we need comprehensive strategies , strong international organisations and the rule of law both within countries and between them .
It is clear that the reform will force farmers and producers to take important and sometimes difficult decisions about their future in the sector .
Firstly , I particularly want to thank all the members of my group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection who have worked so tirelessly with me to reshape this text .
Indeed , Norway &amp; apos ; s Minister for Fisheries and Co@@ as@@ tal Affairs spoke highly of the EU &amp; apos ; s cooperation in this regard .
What I wished to propose , un@@ successfully , as an oral amendment to the recital part , would be : &amp; apos ; whereas the intervention of the European Parliament in the proceedings of national parliaments at the earliest stage of work on any proposed legislation is contrary to the fundamental principle of sovereignty and subsidiarity of Member States and therefore compromises the European Parliament as ever more linked to former Soviet practices &amp; apos ; , etc. as adopted .
I think we , the European Parliament , have to take the initiative in this field .
I want to ask two questions .
All Europeans should not take their liberty for granted , and young Europeans should follow the D@@ EM@@ Y@@ C example in showing solidarity with their neighbours by standing up for democracy and human rights .
These two proposals respond to two key Union priorities : providing assistance to sou@@ the@@ astern Europe and providing it as rapidly and as efficiently as possible .
This plan will be interactive and deal specifically with all the matters raised in the guidelines , always remembering that it will be done within a common European framework of the objectives and guidelines set down .
Its work should consolidate peace and prevent the outbreak of new conflicts .
If you push on relentlessly with this Constitution , if you go on denying the peoples of Europe a say in their future , you are st@@ oring up very serious problems for our children .
We have delivered on our commitments , we must now ensure that we can deliver on our future promises for the future generations in Europe .
If we would have had the freedom to withdraw or postpone the motion of censure , we would have done so .
In any event , as Mr K@@ r@@ ar@@ up has said , these proposals lack proportionality .
That means , as recently stressed by President Barroso and by myself at Tampere , it is of the utmost importance that all Member States continue working together in a spirit of solidarity , not least to assist those southern Member States most affected today by illegal immigration from Africa .
The Commission will shortly consider a proposal to ban the use of mechani@@ cally recovered meat from all bones of ruminants of all ages .
In order to ensure maximum transparency , the Commission will submit an annual report on the progress of the RP@@ R@@ C@@ A to the Member States and Parliament .
But let us look beyond the borders of the European Union .
On &amp; quot ; better &amp; quot ; I urge Commission and Council to look closely at the call of this Parliament for a uniform and compulsory code of good administrative behaviour .
As you are aware , the Commission attaches the highest priority to its strategy on food safety .
I am very supportive of Serbia making progress towards EU accession , as I am all of the Western Balkans , as a former member of the relevant European Parliament delegation .
In order for this provision to be effective , there is a need for a central official under the responsibility of the DG Budget to set minimum standards without undermining the responsibility of spending DGs .
Last year , in September 2007 , the Commission provided an assessment of the system in a report to the European Parliament and to the Council that actually demonstrated the usefulness of the system .
But one issue leaves us divided : should regions be able to appeal to the Court of Justice against acts which they dislike , notably because they feel they violate their own responsibilities or the principle of subsidiarity ?
This is why it is vital that Europe gives a strong public statement on racism and discrimination backed up by legislative action to ban this and to extend the scope of legal redress by shifting the burden of proof from the victim to the racist and allied groups and organisations to bring race discrimination cases to courts across the EU .
I disagree with you that it is not within the Council &amp; apos ; s remit .
Therefore , in this debate the Commission participates as it is associated to the negotiating process , but the Council of Ministers has the final word .
Madam President , I will not go down the road of religi@@ osity followed by the last speaker .
I ask the President of the Parliament to convey to the Council our satisfaction in this matter and would ask also that everything possible be done between now and 1 January 2007 to meet the needs that arise from this new status , and to ensure that the European Parliament and the other EU institutions will be able to provide the appropriate services in Irish .
Does it consider that over the next few years a specific problem will arise as regards the management and security of supply of water resources and drinking water in European Member States ?
The EU has responded quickly , not seeking headlines but with a total focus on getting help to the people in need .
The numbers of shared problems and challenges has grown in Europe and so has the need to address them through shared efforts .
We have also got to make sure there are safeguards , because in encouraging third country nationals into the EU we must also make certain that we are not depriving those countries of the very important key workers that they need to help them develop .
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House .
The European Commission looks forward to the implementation of the comprehensive framework for action .
The European Parliament must strongly condemn such actions , which reveal the u@@ gly and oppressive face of the Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus , in violation of European law and human rights and the Third Vienna agreement of 1975 .
. Mr President , may I say straight away that while I recognise that there is some disagreement between the Commission and the honourable Member on this enormously important matter , we recognise the exemplary diligence with which he has pursued an issue of considerable importance to so many people .
Nuclear proliferation is at such a critical point that it has led person@@ alities like H@@ en@@ ry K@@ iss@@ inger to argue that only the move towards total elimination will ensure non @-@ proliferation proliferation and global security .
I hope that in Conclu@@ sion 9 , where we refer to the Commission &amp; apos ; s decision to review its own legislative proposals against the criteria of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the Commission will be more rigorous in this than some Member States .
If that is correct , that is something that should not have been adopted into law in the European Union .
We must at least agree - and I want the summit to do this - on an integration strategy , including better rights for long @-@ term term legal migrants .
It concerns the health professionals .
The United Kingdom and other countries must sign up to the Council of Europe Convention .
What is important for the EU institutions is that we have a strong commitment to improving the quality of legislation , especially with regard to subsidiarity .
The political response of governments and other institutions to racist and homophobic attacks is crucial and sends very strong signals .
There are differences within Member States and across the whole of the European Union .
There is also a very strong feeling from some Member States under particular pressure that there is a lack of solidarity from others , that their need for support is not given a real practical response .
I am confident that in drawing up these reports the Commission will give full consideration to the views of the relevant Parliamentary committees .
in writing . - I strongly welcome this report , which makes suggestions on how the Consensus on humanitarian aid can be strengthened .
My proposal to make the Development Cooperation Instrument the single administrative and procedural regulation for development cooperation not only gives the Commission the administrative simplification and flexibility it seeks , but also ensures that policy implementation is kept apart from the un@@ predictability of political life .
Our longer @-@ term term assistance is designed to emb@@ ed a process of sustainable environmental protection in the countries in the region , all of which are potential candidate members of the Union .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , firstly I wish to congratulate Mr Krahmer for his excellent report on this difficult and most important subject .
It is important for me , it is important for the ALDE Group , and it is especially important for my country , Sweden , if we are ever going to join the euro .
This is what I want the next research programme to stand for .
No other country or group of countries has set a legally binding process with the scope and potential of this package .
It would be a measure that would be inclusive , that would enable more Members to hold positions of responsibility , and that would make it easier to distribute such posts politically across Parliament .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , as shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group , I would like to start by saying that we welcome the increasing role of the EU as a trading power in every region of the world , including the Pacific region .
It is now clear to everyone that we face more shared challenges than ever before - thanks in part to the forces unle@@ ashed by globalisation .
I am convinced that the code and our related recommendation will play a very significant role in the completion of the internal market for financial services to which Parliament regularly reiterates its support .
I am glad to see that the points we insisted on are in the report .
On the other hand , it is very important since it concerns how Parliament exercises its control over implementing acts .
As a point of departure , I recall that it was the European Parliament , first of all the European institutions , that insisted that the Union should show its solidarity with and support for the peace process .
My question to the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , though , relates to the EU drugs strategy within the framework of justice and home affairs , which the Dutch presidency has prioritised .
I intend to come back to that in the time ahead .
There must be an end to political prisoners and politically motivated prosecutions .
There is also open disagreement on most political questions , while there is no sense of urgency or responsibility to overcome this political stalemate .
Recommendation for second reading ( A5 @-@ 0164 0164 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States &amp; # 91 ; 5@@ 6@@ 84 / 1 / 2000 - C5 @-@ 0181 0181 / 2000 - 1998 / 03@@ 58 ( COD ) &amp; # 93 ; ( Rapporteur : Mrs Jackson )
I believe that it is necessary to define the application of the CFP in a clear and consistent manner , setting out a coherent system of regionalisation .
If growth is there , then there is more demand for energy resources , and none of the existing energy resources are in such quantities that we can say easy access is guaranteed .
I accept that this is a matter in which there ought to be more choice and it is an issue of striking the right balance .
Other provisions in what we are proposing do that .
Since the adoption of the recommendation on this topic in October 2009 , the Commission has undertaken a number of actions with stakeholders to drive the agenda forward .
Given the preparation of the Commission green paper on the European public prosecutor , the run @-@ up up to the IGC in 2004 and the fact that several committees of this House were not consulted , I would ask that this report be referred back to committee .
We want the member governments to monitor the application of public procurement rules better and to encourage local authorities to comply with them , because compliance with these new rules will be the test by which this proposal is finally judged .
We recognise the need for better information and , therefore , we will present a proposal during the Greek presidency to have a specific instrument for exchange of harmonised and standardised statistics so far as asylum and migration policy are concerned .
That matters to the public too .
Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Andersson on his report despite the mis@@ giving that I have with regard to some parts of it .
His nomination by the European Council came swiftly and decisively in the wake of the resignation of the present Commission , and my Group welcomed the speed with which the Council responded .
That is what we consider to be a breach of the directive .
After the group chairmen met last night there was agreement among a great many of the groups that we should use the opportunity this week to have some immediate discussion of a political nature in this House .
Our credibility more than ever depends on getting this right .
Madam President , the Committee on Budgets decided that it would be wise to draw up a report on this subject .
It is worth noting that in the last few years several democratic electoral processes have taken place in Venezuela .
That must be our priority .
This is , I believe , self @-@ evident evident .
For these reasons , I support the proposal .
It belongs to national , regional and local authorities .
In short we need to put in place a strategy for the longer term .
But if we were serious about reducing CO2 emissions , surely we should be favouring nuclear power stations and not renewables .
In this way we are affirm@@ ing the principle of individual responsibility of every Commissioner , without calling into question the principle of collegiality for which , under the Treaty , the President of the Commission is guarantor .
However , I shall not repeat the many reservations about the proposals that colleagues have already mentioned .
This mechanism will enable the Commission to keep a close eye on developments in these very important areas .
Having said that , however , I share Parliament &amp; apos ; s concern that if very big fish fac@@ tory vessels were to be excluded from the statutory obligation , that would be very retrograde .
Third , the participation of third countries : we fully agree with the principle of facilitating third countries &amp; apos ; participation in the EIT - this is one of the very important conditions .
Pri@@ ority is therefore given to promoting a peaceful and secure environment in which human rights are respected and democratic processes and institutions can develop .
In answer to your more general question , there may very well be broad sanctions , but it depends on the outcome of the dialogue .
Our demands have been met and now it is our duty to see the Commission pledges and rhetoric translated into action .
I hope it will improve confidence and the functioning of the single European market and eliminate unfair payment practices .
Secondly , this legislation must reaffirm Europe &amp; apos ; s commitment to our core values of respect for diversity and intolerance of discrimination , a commitment that must amount to so much more than the sum of the political compromises of the Council &amp; apos ; s text .
In addition , Israel must find more effective ways of reconciling its legitimate security concerns with the urgent need for genuine Palestinian development .
This is also in accordance with the codecision procedure .
Mr President , we all recognise that many reforms need to take place in Turkey in order that its candidacy for the European Union can be taken forward as rapidly as possible .
I also firmly believe that the information contained on the blacklist needs to be easily accessible and widely available to all stakeholders ( national civil aviation authorities , all EU airports and of course passengers ) .
That is the point that we have to remember time and time again when it comes to agricultural matters .
The time is fast approaching when we should address the difficult and sensitive issue of Kosovo &amp; quot ; s final status .
We oppose the development of the European Union towards a state with superior powers to those of the Member States in all aspects of policy , as the report in practice advocates .
The debate is closed .
All reasonable efforts must be made to reduce the risk from zo@@ on@@ o@@ tic agents to a very low level .
2009 will be a special year , a transition year of great importance marked , I am confident , by the likely entry into force of the new European Treaty , the Treaty of Lisbon .
I am confident that the Heads of State and Government and the parliamentarians here in the European Parliament will look at it in the spirit in which it is designed : yes , it is something a little different , but something which can provide an example of Europe taking a fresh direction and finding new ways to work together .
The Commission is of the opinion that the compromise package tabled by your rapporteur , Mr Rapkay , is a very good result that can be fully supported .
I believe that this innovative approach will provide an example for others to follow .
But we must also look to the older age groups .
As rapporteur on the RE@@ GI Committee , I strongly urge that the appropriations in the preliminary draft budget be restored and that cohesion be considered one of the policy priorities of the EU .
I believe that the European institutions , primarily the European Commission and Parliament , should be given broader powers to promote the health programmes within the European Union .
Secondly , could you give us some indication of when the House will know the procedures to be followed with its committees for the examination , with proper scrutiny , of the proposals now being made by the Council ?
And it is now up to others to decide and I hope they are given the space to make that decision .
The documents adopted by the Commission today are , as the President of the Commission emphasised , proposals for consultation .
Women and children are the most vulnerable in our societies but also in the societies outside , and that is why the Commission is working to streamline its various policy initiatives on violence against women and to create synergies between areas with similar objectives .
This , the reconciliation of work and family life and the elimination of gender stereotypes in the labour market are a must .
Jo@@ ining forces to innovate so as to solve common problems in Europe means more focus , more rapid development , efficiency , including cost @-@ efficiency efficiency , and greater creativity .
So there is a constant contradiction .
I welcome that agreement , but it must be clear - which it is - that the new Parliament must be the one to approve the new President and Commission .
We therefore welcome the statement in the report that space research is one of the priority themes for the Sixth Framework Programme for research and development .
I believe changes in European and American trade policies are likely to prove of greater benefit to developing nations , and I have fears that we could be making mistakes that will have unforeseen consequences for our environment .
I suspect the Commission will be disappointed , because I note in the Community Lisbon Strategy with its 10 priorities , which I am sure all of you have read , that one of the top demands from the Commission is as follows : &amp; apos ; It is essential that the European Parliament , the Council and the European Commission agree on the strategic reform objectives and actions &amp; apos ; .
I look forward to examining it closely .
We also regret that there has not yet been a communication on children &amp; apos ; s rights from the Commission .
It is clear that the unanimous message from the Council is that each Member State wants to have one member on the Management Board .
It has provided a stimulus for the ongoing discussion of the EU &amp; quot ; s support for the UN and the Parliament &amp; quot ; s role in that regard .
This vote is on a recommendation to adopt the findings of the report and not the report itself , following the committee vote there were no further opportunities to amend or improve the text .
For the majority of my Group , this means that we need to think in terms of consolidation over the coming period , rather than enlargement .
In fact , if we were to phase out all kinds of export subsidies without delay , we would deci@@ mate our own dairy industry and food security in this sector , and I seriously question if that is what Parliament really wants to do .
At its core - and here I agree completely with the Commissioner - is an extremely important proposal for Europe &amp; apos ; s consumers in the internal market .
It is fortunate that my own country , Ireland , is a member of the euro zone as the current currency has been a source of stability for Ireland and other countries at a time of unprecedented turbulence and during the current global recession .
The Commission is also conducting a review on implementation of the European regulatory measures in the energy sector .
In this respect we should enhance the participation in the workforce of women , young people and older people , by providing new opportunities through , for instance , flexibility of working hours , the promotion of part @-@ time time jobs and autonomous work .
While qu@@ ac@@ ks of State must each produce his plan ,
The existing rules are good and strong , but we are making them more consistent , and that is a step forward .
I believe we can do so without destroying biotechnology .
Of course , we do not think that problems can be solved just by throwing money at them , but in fact there are situations , like the current one , when we believe special attention has to be given to a situation of social urgency .
It goes on to say : &amp; apos ; ... the future of all countries in the region lies in the EU &amp; apos ; .
It is issues like this which demonstrate how Europe should proceed .
I would appreciate the Commissioner &amp; apos ; s reassurance as to his understanding of the impact - or hopefully non @-@ impact impact - of this option .
If the Commission as an institution is serious about the involvement of Parliament , it should be joining with us in calling for an interinstitutional agreement to give Parliament a formal say in the preparations for the spring Council .
Pro@@ du@@ cers , traders and the entire agri @-@ food food business have felt the effect .
In@@ vari@@ ably it is meaningless .
The abuse of these drugs poses a serious health risk to impres@@ sion@@ able young people who are persuaded to experiment with them .
Finally , as a committee we urge that the &amp; apos ; Citizens First &amp; apos ; information campaign should not neglect to remind citizens of their worthwhile right to petition the Parliament to help ensure that the rights of the European citizen are respected .
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it .
I do not always agree with the Council , but I agree with its view that approximation of the criminal law of the Member States could be necessary for certain specific types of offences , but when approxim@@ ating criminal law the specificity of the national systems has to be taken into account .
That is why 50 % of the people out of work in Europe today are long @-@ term term unemployed .
I would urge the European Commission to allocate substantial funds to ensure that this new scheme is widely publicised across the European Union .
. I fully support this Resolution , especially Par@@ a 9 which stresses the need to take full account of the quality of public services in completing the internal market ; calls for a framework directive on services of general interest ; insists that the single market can only be developed in a context of fair competition , fighting social dumping and promoting cohesion ; calls on the Commission to contribute to the fight against the &amp; apos ; race to the bottom &amp; quot ; approach in all fields , including in relation to maritime re flag@@ ging .
We want to find that balance .
We aim to be flexible and to achieve a good compromise for the transitional regulation .
I can tell you , internally in the Commission as well , that we have had a discussion with the Commissioner responsible for competition and that we are very much aware of these problems .
So while we see on the one hand an increasing demand for closer cooperation with some of our most important partners , on the other , we have lac@@ ked the legal framework to be able to follow things up .
The European Union has already expressed its point of view and its willingness to help in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the new Democratic Republic Congo .
The participation of women in the decision @-@ making making process is essential to achieving a substantial change in their status in society and will have concrete significance for future improvements .
The revival of the Maltese application to join the European Union will ensure that it is dealt with in the context of the next round of enlargement negotiations , in accordance with commitments given by EU Heads of Government at Cor@@ f@@ u .
The report also contains errors of fact .
Let me , therefore , be completely clear .
Today , the EU is Latin America &amp; apos ; s second @-@ largest largest trading partner and the biggest investor in the region .
On Amendments Nos 71 to 74 inclusive , on the recruitment of third country nationals with a permanent right of residence , the Commission is aware that there is a discussion amongst political groups about the possibility of finding a compromise arrangement on this issue which is of concern to many honourable Members .
It is correct .
This is a very valuable programme and one that needs to be made more effective .
I respect the fact that the Irish people have now voted in favour of the Lisbon Treaty , though I think it disgraceful that they were pres@@ su@@ ris@@ ed into holding a second vote by countries which had not even held one referendum .
In addition , the global community has decided that abortion should never have been promoted as a method of family planning .
I look forward to continuing to work in full cooperation with the European Parliament and the European Commission .
I should like to return to the issue of Burundi , which my question addressed .
Fish@@ er@@ men and women will have their say in this process through their regional advisory councils , which will have an extremely important role to play .
Mr President , this is a &amp; apos ; catch @-@ the the @-@ eye eye &amp; apos ; debate .
We believe that the military regime is a threat to the region and , most of all , to the country and the people of Burma .
The EU , within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the Treaties , will continue to tackle racism and xenophobia , both within the Union itself and in the context of our external actions .
Let us be clear that this is of tremendous importance to all the people of Europe .
Consid@@ erable progress has been achieved concerning transparency about the beneficiaries of EU funds .
I would like to refer to three in particular .
For my part , I would like to focus my remarks on three aspects which concern the running of European policies and the attitudes which we have taken in Parliament in previous years to these aspects .
The economic governance reports on the whole are not , in my view , the best option , but in the situation in which we find ourselves , they are probably the least worst .
We will know hopefully before the end of the week what the situation is going to be .
The European Union should use all appropriate fora to press for progress on these issues .
So what I think should happen is that we do negotiate and reach an agreement on what would be sensible , which would be to fix an early date for the Commission to be replaced , on condition that the new Commission has the full legitimacy of going through the full procedure by the new house to be elected in the European elections .
I can assure you that the European Parliament will be kept fully informed about the conclusions of the Scientific Steering Committee .
The proposal we discussed today confirms the European Union &amp; apos ; s political will and our commitment on the liberalisation of short @-@ term term visa requirements for the citizens of all Western Balkan countries .
The great concern that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party took to this debate was to ensure that we should be able to protect appropriate diversity .
I did not vote to support this report because , while much of the content of the work programme is acceptable , I was concerned about what is not there .
In the light of the recent visit to the European Parliament by the Israeli Foreign Minister , who advocated the strengthening of the Israel @-@ EU EU relationship politically , and the current Action Plan just completed by the High Representative , the approval of this Neighbourhood Agreement would benefit both parties by improving each party &amp; apos ; s understanding of the other and hast@@ ening the arrival of peace and stability in the Middle East and Mediterranean .
The Neighbourhood Policy is the policy that tries to complement this Euromed Partnership .
We should have the humility to recognise the right of democracy and parliamentary supremacy within the 27 Member States .
No @-@ one one can seriously dispute , however , that it would be preferable if - a huge &amp; apos ; if &amp; apos ; - we were able to disarm Saddam Hussein by inspections .
Those who wish to force this Constitution upon the peoples of Europe should pause for thought .
I fully support this common @-@ sense sense strategy which broad@@ ens the system of cooperation between national authorities .
Most of the Union &amp; quot ; s attention has been focused on enlargement , the new accession process and future enlargement .
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available .
These discussions were very fruitful and allowed us to gain a first idea of where Member States stand and to understand the very peculiar economic circumstances that are a feature of each Member State .
As regards cohesion and inclusion , we must tackle increasing social inequalities and persistent regional disparities .
Contro@@ versi@@ al areas such as biotechnology must , in my view , be part of this equation .
I am , though , g@@ lowing hot in my opposition to the concept of man @-@ made made climate change .
Along with the Council and the Commission , it forms a crucial part of the institutional checks and balances through which the European project has succeeded so well on behalf of all of us .
I have one reservation , however .
This is the first step in our common journey towards 2012 and the asylum package .
The EU must work for a peaceful and just settlement to the disputes in the Middle East , particularly by pressing for a secure and independent Palestinian State .
Thirdly , there is nothing on strengthening the role of the regions within the political system of the Union and , fourthly and finally , we would have appreciated some critical self @-@ assessment assessment of the functioning and performance of the European Council itself .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s strategy of assistance is delivery of a flexible package of emergency and rehabilitation assistance according to the changing requirements , as well as the creation of conditions which enable structural development actions to be undertaken .
But I have to say as well - not only here , but I have said it elsewhere , including in the negotiations in Geneva - that the European Union is not going to give any further concessions in agriculture .
So we exacerbate the crisis by having yet more integration , and all of the things that we heard about in the debate yesterday on this report - &amp; apos ; we need fiscal union &amp; apos ; , &amp; apos ; we need economic governance &amp; apos ; . You can see the flaw in the logic there , my friends .
But in order to exercise this responsibility we need legal instruments which allow us to act quickly and flexi@@ bly .
Perhaps now is the time to look at this af@@ resh .
Madam President , first I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Klinz , for his own @-@ initiative initiative report and also for taking on board all the proposals and opinions of the other groups .
Madam President , I voted in this report in order to help Member States and I therefore pick out these bits : Amendment 46 , split vote - Member States &amp; apos ; own laws may not be waived .
I would also stress that specifically in response to Parliament &amp; apos ; s concern , the 18@@ th Annual Report relating to the year 2000 will contain a specific section on the management of exceptions to the harmonisation which Member States enjoy under Article 95 of the Treaty .
In conclusion , I believe that , by adopting this regulation , we will contribute to raising awareness and to upholding high standards of animal welfare in the European Union .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a few final comments .
Here , we have to focus on creating opportunities , because much of this work is , in any case , being done by women , but without proper remuneration and without the opportunity to accumul@@ ate rights , including pension rights for their old age .
However , this is not an argument about whether the EU is a good thing or a bad thing .
However , there is a considerable lack of transparency in the management of those agencies receiving discharge within the framework of the Commission &amp; apos ; s accounts only .
Research and innovation are the key tools . They are the tools at our disposal to help Europe through the economic crisis that we currently face .
According to the Euro Group agreement the ESM will be an intergovernmental mechanism whose governance will be based on the model of the European Financial Stability Facility .
However , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .
However , I would like to underline that , given the size of the public health problem we are facing , the interests of the population at risk must be given priority over dogmatic positions of principle .
The Commission has been active on a broad front , including , for example , progress on market economy status ; visa facilitation and energy issues for Ukraine ; the border assistance mission on the Moldovan / Ukrainian border ; creating new fora in which to discuss issues such as democracy , human rights and governance , for instance with our Mediterranean partners - I need only recall the Euromed Conference in Barcelona in November ; the preparations to pursue our educational cooperation and in particular to extend tw@@ inning and technical assistance and information exchange programmes to TA@@ I@@ E@@ X programmes to our partners ; and our proposal for a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument - the EN@@ PI - that will not be decou@@ pled from the neighbourhood policy .
As on every occasion when the current presidency of the Union is held by a State that is not a member of the G8 , the Union was represented at the summit by the Council President and by the President of the Commission .
It is vitally important to preserve the political legitimacy of the Commission in all Member States and in the eyes of each national electorate .
However we are following the issue , we are studying the latest technology development and there will be an evaluation in 2012 .
Nevertheless , in our opinion , the report is not as ambitious as it should be .
Therefore , we particularly welcome the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal that treatment granted to the EU be extended to all ACP @-@ EPA EPA partners before trade liberalisation with the EU .
You have to prepare for the conference on climate change in Kyoto .
If we do this , we are sure to succeed .
I would like to say that I deplore the slu@@ ggish progress on this question in the Council .
We discussed and debated the Food Safety White Paper and went on to pass legislation on food and feed and on the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority .
The European Council ( Brussels , 19 @-@ 20 20 March 2009 ) &amp; apos ; recognising that free and fair trade is a key element for global recovery &amp; apos ; , called for &amp; apos ; a swift conclusion of bilateral trade negotiations and of the WTO Doha Development Agenda &amp; apos ; .
. Mr President , as someone who opposed the previous nominee , I should like to say to Commissioner Frattini how pleased I am to see him take up his duties .
In@@ fer from what has happened .
But I think that the offers on the table from the European Union are strong and will certainly result in benefits to global trade .
In line with the Commission communication on the budget review and the conclusions of the fifth report on social cohesion , the Europe 2020 Strategy provides both a clear set of common priorities and the framework for identification of funding priorities post @-@ 2013 2013 in line with the objectives of smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , including human capital development .
in writing . - An Irish &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; to the Lisbon Treaty is good news for Europe .
That has not happened throughout the European Union , and we have to do something about it .
Much more needs to be done .
However , we need to ensure that measures we propose are both sensible and practical .
We might have expected that , with just over three weeks of the life of this Parliament left to go , we might be on the g@@ ent@@ le sl@@ ope towards an election .
The Commission is in favour , but the precondition or the base for such an approach , which would be welcome , is an existing and functioning efficient litigation system on damages actions at the level of Member States .
I strongly support this programme and I would urge you , Commissioner , to seek whatever resources you need to advance it .
EU controls that kill innovation and EU power to distort market demand , flying in the face of what the voters expect .
It will provide us with openness for third countries and for investments in other parts of the world ; that was not always the situation .
You cannot embrace globalisation while abandoning large numbers of our citizens .
We must also redouble our efforts to promote clean energy - and the am@@ az@@ ing thing is this : we know how .
Once citizens have good , accurate information and once they are aware of the possibilities for action , then we can provide the service they need .
We want to make sure that our economies are competitive enough to create jobs and to sustain the welfare of all our citizens and that is what our work is about .
You are the directly @-@ elected elected representatives of the peoples of Europe .
There is a method - not one which I recommend - but one which may be needed in extrem@@ is , in order to press ahead , and that is to invoke Article 40 of the Treaty allowing reinforced cooperation between a certain number of Member States .
I hope that we are going to carry those forward seriously , because we need to examine this ideal of becoming the world &amp; apos ; s most internationally competitive continent in the light of asking ourselves what the implications are for the global losers if we are the global winners , and what this is going to do to enhance stability , equality and justice in the world .
This Parliament obviously shares the Commission &amp; quot ; s desire for greater efficiency , simplification and flexibility in the legislative domain , but cannot allow this to happen at the expense of its own competences and of democracy itself .
It also guarantees that public authorities will always be able to regulate in favour of the general interest .
Consequently , I endorse the compromise reached through the wise handling afforded by Ms Oomen @-@ Ruijten Ruijten , with the honest and fruitful cooperation of all those interested colleagues , who may have differing opinions on certain specific issues , but who all agree on the principle that the EU can achieve more by cooperating constructively with the Turkish people than by destruc@@ tively antagon@@ ising them .
Therefore , and in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community , the Commission will evaluate the need to come forward with new legislative proposals , reserving its right to decide as and when it would be appropriate to present any such proposals .
This is the biggest crisis that you have ever had , and I am telling you now that this is serious .
Enlargement has contributed to an unprecedented extension of the area of peace , security and prosperity in Europe and now we prepare the further extension of this area to encompass in the years to come the western Balkans , Iceland and Turkey .
The outcome of the G20 should ensure an adequate balance between short @-@ term term fiscal expansion , which is , of course , necessary , and long @-@ term term fiscal sustainability , which calls for an orderly withdrawal of the stimulus when the time comes .
In addition to the many points made in the report , my main message to the Council and to the Commission would be as follows .
The final opinion was adopted on 15 July this year , and the Commission is now evaluating the necessary steps to be taken .
It is also vital to improve the current situation of women working in industry .
in writing . - I strongly believe the Commission was right to propose amendment of Regulation ( EC ) No 1080 / 2006 on the European Regional Development Fund as regards the eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities .
Commissioner Pin@@ he@@ iro will recall that many of us expressed some reservations about the Green Paper but we very much welcome the consultation that has taken place and the opportunity for dialogue since the publication of the Green Paper .
In this regard , the Commission will make a proposal as soon as possible , and if feasible by the end of this year , to the European Parliament and to the Council to introduce this new dedicated test cycle together with appropriate emission limits that are equivalent to those which are already foreseen for 2006 in this agreement .
I think it is important to discuss that at the European Council at the end of this week .
We would like the European Parliament to join the Commission in encouraging Member States to pursue macro @-@ economic economic stability .
Taking a common approach to addressing climate change is also at the heart of my party &amp; apos ; s approach to the European Union under David Cameron , who is our party leader , and hopefully the next Prime Minister of Britain .
It is a double problem .
I find it totally am@@ az@@ ing that groups in Parliament will vote against this amendment .
Today we have nine different European missions around the world undertaken by European forces and that shows that European defence can indeed work .
However , keeping our own currency is only part of the answer .
Why is it not left to Member States , if it is their rules that control the situation ?
This has created conflicts .
It presents Europe with a big challenge because most measures of fiscal policy need to be taken at national level , yet the EU has a crucial role of coordination .
And then they will be ready to discuss a new treaty for Europe .
The matter has been formally taken up by the European Union in the framework of the last session of the EU @-@ China China Human Rights Dialogue , held in Beijing on 19 October , as rightly mentioned by the honourable Member from Finland .
I do not think , therefore , that we need further discussion at this point .
If we are going to fight terrorism , we must all work together within the law .
Let us not pretend that the present proposals have this in mind .
It is very important that we put down deeper democratic roots for the common foreign and security policy and that should involve not only this distinguished Parliament but also national parliaments .
Mr President , this is an important report on the Commission &amp; apos ; s Green Paper on the statutory audit , and I wish to thank Mrs Sierra González for the complet@@ eness and thoroughness of her report .
In the last two years since Tampere , the programme of cooperation on justice matters has been heavily weigh@@ ted to the security side of the sc@@ ales - especially since 11 September with the anti @-@ terrorism terrorism package .
In addition , the European Union also cooper@@ ates closely with UN agencies , as well as Israeli and Palestinian NGOs , actively involved in monitoring , reporting and advocating the rights of the child .
This development on these policies has , of course , been strongly supported by the European Commission in cooperation with the Member States .
We should not wait for the next tragedy in order to advance European integration in these areas : we must act now to prevent it .
The Commission has therefore launched a number of initiatives in this regard and I am happy to answer the question by the honourable Member of Parliament .
Our Member States also need to access those global capital markets and , whilst all eyes are focused on the European Stabilisation Fund , and whether it has achieved any current reduction in the immediate volatility , fundamentally , long @-@ term term confidence will only be achieved if , as well as this ambitious growth , our deficits are brought under control and public finances themselves are seen to be sustainable .
I firmly believe that it is vital to put in place mechanisms that allow the disabled to travel within the European Union on an equal footing as every other citizen .
Enlargement is a power ingredient showing attractiveness and authority as well as the absorption capacity - things we do not miss a chance to claim for our Union .
Ukraine has not found the transition to a market economy an easy process .
I ask Members to dismiss it with their vote .
I welcome this report &amp; apos ; , as it expands the powers of the European Parliament and enables it be an ever more effective and democratic institution .
The Council could , to this end , draw inspiration from constructive practices followed during the last financial perspective negotiations , which enabled a satisfactory dialogue to take place with the European Parliament , culmin@@ ating in the adoption of the current interinstitutional agreement in May 1999 .
It is in Europe &amp; apos ; s interest and the whole world &amp; apos ; s interest that China shows the world what must be done in these circumstances .
That may save me a bit of work if I am doing the votes later in the week .
If that means Member States , and indeed the EU itself , repudi@@ ating other international agreements , then so be it .
This trend can only be coun@@ tered by economic policies focused on growth , respect for workers &amp; apos ; rights and the provision of quality public services .
That is a reasonable way for the House to proceed .
The Council hopes that the remaining negotiations will soon be successfully concluded .
I would urge you , Mr President , to show some flexibility and to allow the House to vote on the request by Mrs Müller .
