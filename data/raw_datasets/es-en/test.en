It is obvious , Madam Commissioner - and this House is tired of repeating it - that when the fleet is asked to make the kind of sacrifices contained in this project , it must either come equipped with serious and guaranteed socio-economic economic measures or it will be condemned to failure .
The Council has always defended this policy as an emblem of the European Union and a platform for achieving the convergence targets that the EU has set itself .
For many institutions , this approach may be neither desirable nor appropriate and , of course , its use must never be compulsory .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report , because I believe this is an important opportunity to establish common control of the European Union &apos; s external borders .
Secondly , we must bear in mind that Cuba &apos; s application has the support of all the ACP countries .
Therefore , on behalf of my delegation , I once again ask the President to investigate what happened and to take every step to ensure that this situation does not reoccur .
in writing . - The request complies with the requirements of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and relates to 200 of the 594 workers made redundant over a period of nine months in three Polish companies dealing in the manufacturing of machinery and equipment and which reduced their exports by 58 % .
I believe it is necessary to improve the criteria that are going to define sustainability with an open mind , because the integral policy requires that we incorporate the multifaceted nature of sustainability .
3 % is laid down in the Treaty and the Commission will ensure that that reference value is respected .
In the event that a Commissioner clearly loses the trust of Parliament , it will be up to you and the person concerned to take responsibility .
Despite our requests in this respect , and aside from the reform of the monitoring policy which has just been presented , we have so far been unable to obtain any better idea of what is to come .
But in reply to an earlier remark , I would like to say to the Austrian Presidency that , as far as the Socialist Group is concerned , the Union has one priority at the moment and that priority is employment . More specifically , my group believes that the governments that currently make up the majority in the Union , some of which are socialist , while others are a coalition between socialists and Christian Democrats , are highly concerned about employment because it is the issue that also concerns us as citizens .
We all know that , following the current discussions on the financial perspectives , there may not be sufficient funds even to cover the lines that until now have been funded by means of the rural development fund , let alone the new actions planned following the reform of September 2003 , on improving safety , food quality and livestock welfare .
The cornerstone of our strategy is the concept that short-term term difficulties should not be dealt with in ways resulting in long-term term imbalance . Instead , it is essential to tackle such difficulties bearing in mind the current economic situation , possible future challenges , and existing provisions for coordinating budgetary policies .
I think that , at the moment , this formula of compromise between Parliament , the Council and the Commission could help to solve the problems without us having to resort to the urgent procedure that the Commission originally proposed .
While last week I was told that my question on the maintenance or modification of the decision to reduce the number of Spanish translators in the European Commission was going to be the third question to be replied to during this Question Time , last night I received a communication indicating that the President of Parliament had judged my question to be inadmissible .
The European Council therefore invites the Commission to undertake a full , wide-ranging ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending , including the CAP , and of resources , including the UK rebate , to report in 2008 / 9 &apos; .
We are talking about a regulation that is very ambitious in its wording , which will compel the Member States to be extremely vigilant and not to spare any material or human resources - one of the weak points of the whole control policy - to turn words into deeds .
I am now calling for a consensus to establish a European model .
With regard to the European coordinator , as I indicated previously , the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 9 and 10 , with certain clarifications , while Amendment No 8 cannot be accepted as such by the Commission , which does not mean that this Parliament will not be informed of the appointment of coordinators , but that the Commission will inform Parliament of the appointments as and when they are agreed .
Can the Commission tell us , therefore , when it decided to introduce this new element and why it has not waited for the reform of the COM in order to do so .
They have produced a report that we in Parliament can endorse , and which will be a positive signal for bringing to an end uncertainty for European farmers .
On this point , our group differs from Mr Cox &apos; s approach .
This is carried out more slowly and with more difficulties because the Member States &apos; governments fail to cooperate and the Commission , Commissioner , is too soft on them .
Paragraph 36 and others refer to this aspect .
This is why we propose establishing a legal framework .
You have four minutes for your speech .
This , too , is something that the Commission cannot do by itself .
You can see that for yourself .
That is what we have to preserve and that , if we do not carry out the appropriate reforms , will be very difficult to preserve in a Europe of 28 .
Support for the Convention is something that this Parliament chose to adopt a long time ago , even before Nice .
As regards the question asked by Mr Cohn-Bendit Bendit , in accordance with our Rules of Procedure , any member of the House is naturally entitled to declare at any time , a personal interest in relation to any matter being discussed here .
Ladies and gentlemen , despite the efforts made over the past decade , the situation in Mercosur and Latin America in general is once again a cause for concern .
It should perhaps be deduced from Mr Blair &quot; s words that the figures that have so far been bandied about in the Council are going to be renegotiated .
It is unfortunate in a political sense because it poses a serious threat to the reputation of this House , of the Council itself and of the Commission as guardian of the Treaties . Indeed , it puts the whole enlargement process at risk .
If it decides to take no action , that will mean that it accepts the accusations .
The Commission &apos; s services are currently studying the latest reply from those authorities .
Mrs Napoletano , we women do not always have to be demonstrating that we work better than men ; we simply want men to recognise our work on an equal footing with that of their male colleagues .
The report seems to respond positively to these questions . It also puts forward certain proposals that would undoubtedly improve the current situation .
We shall keep a special watch to ensure that the freedom of the individual and the rule of law are always scrupulously upheld .
I also regret the fact that the summit with President Obama planned for the spring is not going to take place .
We cannot achieve a more open , transparent and democratic Europe if the European Parliament is not fully involved in the work of the IGC .
Kazakhstan is an important country surrounded by other important countries - Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and even Mongolia - all of which are of enormous interest to the European Union . This is due not only to their significant potential in terms of natural resources - natural gas , oil , gold , wool - but because the European Union is the global power that at this moment in time can contribute most to resolving the deficits that oppress these countries most after almost a century of Soviet influence : the democratic deficit , the human rights deficit , and the deficit in terms of learning how to establish themselves in a free market economy .
The Community must continue to contribute to the modernisation of the fleet , by means of structural measures , strengthening the aspects relating to safety and living conditions on board , without this involving any increase in fishing effort .
From this House , we must insist that those responsible for public procurement within the various administrative bodies incorporate terms into their tender specifications that facilitate positive discrimination in favour of SMEs and remove contractual provisions that hinder their participation .
Mr President , I simply wish to make it plain and clear that , as group chairman , I have expressed the hope that the judicial and government institutions will take full advantage of this opportunity to put an end to General Pinochet &apos; s impunity and I think that all the political groups should support a serious and comprehensive debate . In this respect , and in principle , subject to the agreement of my group at a meeting of the entire group , I support Mrs Green &apos; s proposal for a proper debate during the next part-session session .
Clearly , both legislative acts recognise the fundamental importance of access to the network by third parties .
It is an absolutely fundamental principle .
The Palestinian area does have a preferential system , just like the Israeli area .
If diamonds are not controlled it is clear that peace and stability in Africa cannot be promoted .
In the countries surrounding us , in the European Union , security and defence policies now have nothing to do with defending territory : security policy is now a projection of foreign policy .
Talks and negotiations are continuing . They are complex .
The situation is precarious in some cases , and continual monitoring and support are needed . Nonetheless , the European Union is a lodestar for Latin America and for the Caribbean .
Fortunately , in Spain , the commitment to European construction has united most of the political forces , including those in Catalonia .
Mr President , in this joint debate we are going to discuss three reports which relate to four Commission proposals , which means that I have an unusual number of roles to play .
I am sure the House agrees that on this occasion the guidelines are being produced against a background of almost complete uncertainty . Indeed , if the debate could be postponed until Friday we might be in a better position to make specific decisions .
Mr President , Mr Papadimoulis , the Commission is completing its analysis of Greece &apos; s revised GDP and GNP figures . It has used the same procedure for that analysis as for all of the other Member States .
And , by the way , in the case of Spain , there is more than enough evidence not only that human rights have been violated but also that the law on aliens has been infringed .
Human rights are most problematic , of course , together with the rejection of intervention in internal affairs and other arguments which are familiar to us .
With a good framework agreement , the question of individual condemnation of Commissioners will be put on the correct footing : that of the public political commitment of President Prodi and all the candidates to this Parliament .
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions .
Fourthly , and in relation to the use of FEDER funds , we believe that there should be more effort to show solidarity , and that is not happening , and the forecasts therefore seem to us be insufficient .
I do not think that should be criticised , quite the contrary .
As a result of this meeting , a Declaration was approved which stresses the need for cooperation between Europe and Asia in order to organise migratory flows in an integrated fashion and which specifies , amongst other aspects , the establishment of a network of national points of contact for continuing the dialogue and developing future actions .
That is the true purpose of the resolution that we are going to vote on tomorrow .
We do not agree with the advanced status of Morocco while the Saharan people are not allowed to exercise their right to self-determination determination and they are permanently under persecution , I repeat , permanently under persecution from the Moroccan authorities .
The promises made by the regional authorities prior to these missions have not been fulfilled , however , and they have not resolved the problems , reformed the laws , assisted the people affected or applied the recommendations approved by this Parliament in 2005 .
However , firstly , Turkey must show willing .
In this regard , on 9 October the Commission presented to the Council of Ministers its new proposal containing a statement of projects of European interest .
Only through constant and rigorous work by everybody in this institution will we be able create true equality between men and women .
We cannot consider a convention which from the very start has been incomplete to be a draft convention .
I understand that Portugal is affected by this .
Firstly , I would say that , at the moment , jurisdictional procedures which extend beyond the structure of the European Union do not inspire confidence − we have great confidence in the wonderful institutions of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance − and , secondly , that the issue of languages is not a trivial matter .
The Council &apos; s proposal was perfectly clear .
It was not easy to achieve the very broad agreement that was reached in this House , given that both the various political groups and the interests of certain countries put forward very different ideas as to how to modify this regulation .
But this is a useful document .
After the adoption of recitals 1 and 2 in committee there were negotiations between Parliament and the Commission , which Mrs Wallström referred to , and we tabled a final amendment , Amendment 4 , which replaces the current Amendment 2 , and establishes a formula for cooperation between the three institutions .
I think you combined a large dose of idealism and a large dose of realism in one speech .
Most of the arguments put forward for debate in the House have been fair ones .
I hope that the Commission will welcome this idea with the high degree of efficiency we have come to expect of it and I should like to thank the Commission in advance .
It is true that today , we are talking about macro-financial financial assistance , therefore , with clearly defined objectives , which will undoubtedly improve the financial room for manoeuvre so that we can tackle the other difficulties such as those which you have raised during tonight &apos; s debate .
Mr President , I should like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur , Mr Jové , for his splendid work and for always being willing to collaborate with members of the Committee on Agriculture .
For that reason , we approved the Small Business Act and , for that reason also , exercises such as this one are vital to the continuing progress of Member States in applying the political and legislative measures that we have agreed .
Ladies and gentlemen , the White Paper on European transport policy provides an alarming description of the development of rail freight transport .
In any event , I would like to respond to the two questions which are the subject of today &apos; s document : what is the current situation and what new practices are proposed .
In this respect , with regard to information on the euro , I would like to inform this Parliament that , over recent months , I have begun a programme of visits , that will continue over the months between now and the end of the year , to all the new Member States to discuss in detail with their authorities , both with their governments and with the Presidents of their respective Central Banks , their degree of preparedness for joining the euro zone when the time comes .
We should therefore all be pleased , since I believe that this is the right approach , as is being demonstrated in the case of the Mediterranean .
This instrument , together with the international ITER agreement , forms the current basis of our joint work .
It will therefore be necessary to provide for a combination of public pensions and offer older people the opportunity to work if they so wish . Flexible working patterns and equal opportunities are very important in this connection and need to be promoted .
I have the impression in this regard that the Commission is proposing an approach which prioritises , or basically only takes into account , the issue of the rapid regeneration of stocks and ignores the other facet of sustainable development .
In this respect , I want to call on the European Commission and the Commissioner to urge the Spanish and French Governments to solve this problem with a view to achieving a truly European rail system .
As we will see , these are different aspects of the same problem .
It would be absurd to go right back to zero after all the work we have done over such a long time and after the work many of you have also done over such a long time .
I want to take this opportunity to emphasise once again that the Presidency is reminding all the contracting parties to the Cotonou Agreement that full implementation of this agreement is urgent , since it is an essential component of the European Union &apos; s foreign cooperation and development policy . I did so myself on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly which took place in Cape Town from 18 to 21 March this year .
We must make a determined effort to tackle the debate on the workings of the international financial system in what is now , to all intents and purposes , a globalised economy .
These amendments , which the Commission cannot accept , are Amendments Nos 1 , 7 , 20 and 25 .
What about Mr Voggenhuber ?
That , however , is not all that is needed : we must also harmonise our laws to achieve high standards of consumer protection in an area such as this , where there is a highly significant imbalance between the information held by the vendors of the products and that held by the purchasers .
Mr President , there are times when cynicism can reach such a degree of moral degradation that it is truly amazing .
The difference between the Commission &apos; s proposals and the European Parliament &apos; s is EUR 151 .
Mr President , Commissioner , we agree with the aims of this &apos; health check &apos; , but not all the proposed measures .
With regard to enlargement , Mr President , in view of the comments by the French Home Affairs Minister , Mr Sarkozy , to the effect that there is a degree of fatigue when it comes to enlargement and his request for a debate in the Council in June on assessing the limits to the European Union &quot; s capacity for absorption − and Mr Brok &quot; s report is the next item on the agenda − I would like to know whether the Commission agrees with Mr Sarkozy &quot; s request to the Council and whether it believes that the Austrian Presidency of the Union should provide a definitive response to the issue of the geographical limits of our political project .
I believe that the overall result is positive and that every day the Court provides the Parliament with independent and professional assistance of ever-higher higher quality .
This means that while we - the former - apply a special zero rate duty to it , others apply taxes which may even triple the price to the consumer in the absence of that taxation .
I do not believe that Mrs Miguélez would deserve that and , in any event , I would repeat once again my spirit of cooperation and I thank you once again for your admirable efforts to achieve a balanced result which , in my view , has not been achieved .
Why are there so many problems ?
The reasons for this are budgetary and the objective is to dismantle the limited common policies .
To this end , we have to identify , firstly , the areas in which it is possible to implement rationalisation measures , secondly , areas where there are new and increasing needs , and thirdly , general principles in accordance with which actions are carried out .
Perhaps the ad hoc response will be to arrange for it to be sent now , rather than make Algeria wait its turn . Perhaps another ad hoc response could be to somehow increase the number of members in the delegation , in order to cover as much ground as possible .
? and let us hope that the inspectors can have more time to continue their work and , if possible , as I said before , to complete their mandate in accordance with Resolution 1441 .
The management policy based on TACs and quotas must leave room for effort-based based management .
The public understand this perfectly well .
That is why it is necessary to pay more attention to energy sources distributed extensively and uniformly , permitting rational and responsible use by citizens in each location , together with democratic levies and new values .
That is the most significant achievement of the Treaty of Lisbon .
That explanation , however , did not end on Monday , because another element of that meeting that I believe to be very important is that the debate on the French budgetary strategy , and the debate on the budgetary strategy of any other country , will take place , just has it has been until now , within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact , with France presenting a revised stability programme , which will be analysed by the Commission and by the Council and it will be the ministers , meeting within the Council , in the Eurogroup and also within Ecofin , who will give their opinion on the programme of fiscal consolidation and adjustment presented by France .
However , the problem is wider than this as these federative bodies tend to increase sanctions when people resort to the ordinary courts .
We have the responsibility , as elected representatives , for construction rather than destruction .
Parliament will , in future , require that the principles underlying its decision-making making should be observed by means of an agreement on this future regulation model and that these principles , to the extent that they can be applied , should be of substance and respond to more practical issues rather than to generalities .
Unfortunately , the Ariane Programme has got lost in the labyrinths and we have been waiting for months and months for a solution even though this is about a subject as important as the culture of books and the ways of making it easier to read European authors in different European languages , the languages of European citizens .
Many people fear that the trend of abandoning production will accelerate and that it will be an irreversible blow to some areas with a very low level of profitability and few alternatives for agriculture .
It could be improved by firstly ensuring that this was not just an event for the city , the region or the country concerned , and investing it with a truly European nature .
Furthermore , certain arguments from ultra-conservative conservative sectors against sexual and reproductive health share responsibility for this situation .
It is therefore now time to talk about the distribution of the fruits of that growth and this is not just a concern of the governments and social partners . It is a demand from the European citizens .
But please allow me first of all to thank all those Members of the various parliamentary groups who have chosen to speak and have wished me , and wished us , luck in this enterprise .
The text gives figures which are often so scandalous that they should provide little comfort for our consciences , because , at the end of the day , they demonstrate the incoherence of almost all of us who believe that the education of children is important for the success of any development process .
After months of work , today , we once again voted on a text which , although not as ambitious as the one previously rejected by the PPE and ALDE Groups , is quite brave : it allows mothers to maintain their salary during maternity leave ; it increases their legal protection against redundancy ; it allows greater flexibility in terms of working hours in order to better balance motherhood with work ; it extends maternity leave to at least 20 weeks ( although some of us would have liked it to be 24 weeks , as the World Health Organisation recommends ) ; it facilitates the mobility of working mothers within the EU and it makes progress on joint responsibility for fathers , although not as much as some of us would have liked .
With regard to the Court of Auditors , we would like there to be greater transparency in its declaration of interests , and regarding the Council we agree with making internal auditing more transparent and efficient , but not with increasing bureaucratic obstacles , as the amendment tabled appears to suggest .
However , in reality , many small companies have still not been able to put this into practice .
Another has so far failed to put forward any proposals . I am aware that reduced connection charges and free specially adapted equipment are available in many Member States .
Madam President , other speakers have criticized the Dutch Finance Minister &apos; s political indiscretion .
As you know , we had proposed to the Council that the social clause be extended .
For this reason , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like first of all to thank the Members who have spoken and , especially , Mr Rübig for his initiative of preparing this report .
So the Cohesion Fund is an essential instrument .
That is a great mistake .
It is clear : the internal market is a wonderful achievement , a success story , without any doubt , but it is not perceived as such by the citizens nor small and medium-sized sized enterprises .
We have finally been able to reach agreement , having resolved an important issue which was the maximum time limits for deciding on an authorisation , thus eradicating the well-known known and paralysing administrative silence due to a lack of decision .
We can oblige companies - by means of a directive - to market fuel with 10 ppm of sulphur , but we cannot oblige consumers to change cars at the same time .
Therefore , this Parliament , as the representative of the people who form the European Union , has shown itself on many occasions to be in favour of measures which contribute to preserving this identity , of which one of the most obvious symbols is its language .
Improvements have been made , such as the invoice register or the contractors &quot; database .
Spain has supported the European Union and the European institutions and will continue to do so .
I would therefore like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative and the rapporteur , Mrs De Sarnez , on her excellent report and for all the work she has done so that it can come to fruition .
I think that Parliament can and should , every now and again , be part of this exchange of views between all of the institutions , whose common goal is for the euro zone to operate correctly and for the euro , our common currency , to produce the best possible results for all the citizens of Europe .
You see , fruit and vegetables currently receive EUR 445 million less than the ceiling set in the Financial Perspective .
If there is one industry that can truly provide the catalyst and the boost we need to emerge from the crisis , it is precisely the information technologies and communications sector , that is , the electronic communications and telecommunications sector .
I would like to thank you , Mr President , and all the parliamentary groups and I hope very much that in the time we have ahead of us , as we approach the end of the year 2008 , we will be able to work constructively towards making the dream of so many citizens of the European Union a reality - the implementation of the Treaty in order to have a Europe that has a presence in the international community , in the world , that is proportional to our ideas , our principles , our capabilities and our standard of living .
Mr President , the European sheep and lamb sector has for a number of years been experiencing a serious crisis that is taking it to the brink of collapse , as has already been mentioned .
Mr President , Commissioner , the three reports we are debating today have a basic point in common , on which the success of the single currency will largely depend .
Mr Weil is the epitome of a truly European lawyer : a German by birth , living in France , and practising law of a standard and worthiness that is a source of pride to us all .
I am therefore calling for a Mediterranean policy , a policy fundamentally of social balance and a more active policy for the future .
This objective should be achieved in the near future , when the European Security and Defence Policy effectively comes into operation and when the definitive pattern is established for a relationship of consultation and cooperation with the Atlantic Alliance .
What exactly do you have in mind ?
Those mandates are thus ratified .
And if this is complemented by an effort on the part of businesses to reinvest profits and , in a climate of social dialogue , to adapt labour organization and the needs of the market , we will be taking steps to ensure that citizens are aware that political decisions are moving in the right direction .
Our concern in the Committee on Legal Affairs is , firstly , that we have no wish to hamper the Commission &apos; s right of initiative , we have no wish to hamper the executive functions that must be carried out by the Commission , we have no wish to curtail the possibilities of development , but we do feel that it is important to establish a conceptual difference between the two types of instrument , and that when the Commission feels that it must avail itself of this kind of action , it ought to establish cooperation at least with Parliament , and certainly with the Council , so that preparations for such action do not give rise to misinterpretations or interference .
I would like to express my great concern at the result of the vote on the report presented in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , given that , in my opinion , it takes our concern for consumers &apos; health to irrational extremes .
Some of these farmers have told us of their doubts and , particularly in the case of West African farmers , of their disagreement with the methods used by the Commission to assess farmers &apos; competitiveness , on which the Commission &apos; s criteria for allocating appropriations are based .
First , the adoption of information and communication technology and the development of technologies such as online administration or cloud computing , which save money , reduce costs and effort and , therefore , improve the competitiveness of SMEs .
We hope that this Parliament is up to the job and does not disappoint our fellow citizens ...
Citizens understand it perfectly well , just as they understand and are asking us , in the face of the current situation , with major challenges and with very tense and difficult situations in the markets and in the economic environment , not to remain inactive and to continue taking initiatives .
However , we are not here today to feel sorry for ourselves .
That is not all .
Our efforts over all these years have been to this end , including in 1998 when the North-South South Centre of the Council of Europe , over which I have the honour of presiding , awarded its annual prize to Mr Axworthy , Minister for Foreign Affairs in Canada , for the efforts of his government which took concrete form in the Ottawa Convention .
We must intervene . I do not know how we can do this , but I believe that we must , and quickly .
Is the Commission , therefore , not of the opinion that , with the current inspection system - irrespective of the number of inspectors , which is a solvable matter - such controls are not working ?
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , academics and lawyers .
Where Holy Places are concerned , there is no room for solutions based solely on sovereign rights and it is very important to take proper account of the various international formulae : I believe that the mediation of certain Arab countries , who are closely involved , may be of help .
The EU Member States made the political commitment to send those plans to us by 1 July of this year , although legally they have until February of next year .
It is very difficult to explain to our voters that we have done a good job , which we are all very pleased about , but that we are going to put it off until a later date .
I believed that the democratic parties had the legitimate concern of preparing for democratic elections .
And I would end with this thought , Mr President : it is also essential that we should do something about cross-border border urban areas , where there is a real problem Europe can do something about .
For us to claim a place on the world stage , as the major economic power we are , and to hope to take on the responsibilities and the leading role which the arrival of the euro on the world economic scene could create for us , when we lack the breadth of vision called for in today &apos; s globalised world - overlooking even the view , that fortunately for us , Latin America is the only emerging area not so far shaken by the crisis - would be a contradiction in terms .
The key is that we are talking about regular personnel .
There is no doubt that the Kingdom of Morocco is currently occupying the Western Sahara and this territory is currently undergoing a process of self-determination determination .
Unfortunately , very little : we can support the Government and various sectors of civilian society in their efforts to achieve a rightful peace ; and we can support the efforts of the European Commission , and Commissioner Marín in particular , in that direction .
I believe that it is right that the European citizens should be aware that we are beginning to harvest that fruit , that the economic growth of close to 3 % , the two million jobs created last year , the twelve million jobs created in the euro zone since 1 January 1999 , the very good economic results of the huge majority of the new Member States , the greater consumer confidence and the increase in investment are linked to the efforts and decisions of recent years .
Managing the economy irresponsibly would have meant bread today and hunger tomorrow .
Let us hope that the Council can adopt a decision at the next meeting , although I think that will be difficult , given the development of the technical work .
For example , how does the European Commission interpret the scope of the words &apos; non-significant significant measures &apos; in the ruling ?
As to the reorganization of services , I think it should be speeded up . It ought to be working already .
I would particularly like to express my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Florenz , and to the members of the said committee .
This is why the fifth cohesion report is so timely .
Only five Member States have plans in this area , but all of them have succeeded in reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies , the number of sexually transmitted disease infections and also the number of abortions .
Moreover , we have received direct statements from representatives of human rights organisations telling us about the mood in civil society to question the judicial system , about the administrative repression mechanisms that have brought up to 17 social movement organisations before the courts , and about the persecution of independent journalists and even the delegation from the European Commission .
The proposed law presented by the Commission added to these two objectives - &apos; pollution &quot; and &apos; fires &quot; - the study of biodiversity , climate change and carbon retention .
As has been said before , the States must overcome their individual tendencies - which often reflect their concerns about former colonial relationships or other factors - and commit themselves to a common European project .
We are therefore obliged to review and update the Stability and Growth Pact , because in many respects it does not work - particularly in relation to growth - and because we have had to go to the Court of Justice to get certain States to apply it .
In 1999 , 250 million people did so .
It was one of the objectives that Parliament had for 2006 , and I am not happy with how it has developed .
The motion for a resolution , which we will vote on tomorrow , is based on the idea that artistic education forms the basis for vocational training in the field of the arts and promotes creativity , as well as physical and intellectual development in that sphere ; it considers artistic education to be an essential component of learning in childhood and adolescence and argues that teaching it in schools will lay the foundations for truly democratising access to culture .
I would remind the House radioactive waste results from a whole range of industrial activities other than the generation of electricity . Medical procedures produce waste of this kind too .
And , if that is the case , in what respect ?
Having said this , we must stress two or three points : firstly - and this has been mentioned this afternoon and Mr Duisenberg knows perfectly well that it is a concern of this Parliament - we have the question of transparency .
It is his text and we can only try to cooperate as much as possible to make this Chamber a more lively one , which is closer to the citizens and enables us to convey to them and make them fully aware of our way of working , and on which we are concentrating all our efforts and dedication .
But if 19 reactors from the candidate countries are incorporated , we will clearly exceed that limit .
I would insist that we are seeking a transitional system so that Austria , which participates in the ecopoints system , may arrive , together with the other 14 countries - 24 within a few months - at a common system and a better assumption of the external costs of the different infrastructures throughout the European Union , without exceptions for anybody .
Therefore , in the meantime the current financing agreements will have to be applied .
I think that by chance , the rotating Presidency of the European Union has given my country the best possible opportunity to demonstrate once again that Spain wants to play a decisive role in Europe .
We have already rejected a report which intended , in unclear terms , and for who knows what reason , to take the fingerprints of the illegal immigrants who arrive in the European Union .
Apart from that , in any event , one of the Essen projects is still under way , which included the Basque &apos; Y &apos; , which also involves a European gauge link via that entrance to the Iberian Peninsula .
The European Union cannot suffer in silence in the face of generalised and unjustified embargoes such as Canada &apos; s or the deviousness of the United States &apos; behaviour towards us .
Amendment No 53 would mean excluding all competitive forms of renewable energy from the subsidies and other advantages and , therefore , the Commission cannot accept its wording .
We are all in favour of cooperation , of exchanges , of the development of democracy etc . , but there is nothing tangible in these agreements .
Cohesion is synonymous with solidarity and fairness in the different efforts of the various European regions to achieve competitiveness .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on the presentation of this document , as well as Mrs van den Burg on the efforts she has made to find a balance , and I am going to comment very briefly on three specific points .
That is important .
This is not the time to divide ourselves into those who take a hard line and those who take a softer line or to act solely from the perspective of national interest .
Mr President , no one doubts the need for a new programme of Community action in the field of civil protection , in this instance to 2004 , in spite of the House &apos; s lack of enthusiasm for such a programme .
It also highlights the need for financing that is in line with the requirements of research into new preventive measures , including vaccines .
Without them this framework agreement would certainly not exist and neither would there be any kind of prevention .
Our task is the same in this House , in the national states and in the Court of Auditors . Our aim is to ensure that the Member States understand just how much we need their assistance and cooperation when it comes to controlling Community funds .
Secondly , I would like the Commission to be asked to inform Parliament as soon as possible as to when and how it proposes to put in place the post-electoral electoral protocol mechanism in the framework of Election Observation Missions , proposed by this report .
Mr President , Mr President-in in-Office Office , I do not know if the Presidency-in in-Office Office is fully aware of the fact that large sectors of European public opinion currently think of Agenda 2000 as a threat rather than as a necessity or an opportunity .
They should also be extended to those other languages which are official in certain territories of Europe although they are not official European Union languages .
We are dealing with explanations of vote concerning the amending budget .
On one hand we must boost human rights and uphold human rights , in their traditional sense , as political rights , whereas on the other we must encourage the Nicaraguan Government to continue helping the most deprived sectors in the country .
Mr President , I would like to thank all the speakers for the clarifications they have provided and the issues they have raised .
We believe that the LIFE instrument can contribute to job creation in the field of the environment .
The Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community - in article 25 and in Protocol 2 annexed to that Act - provided the Canary Islands with a special status which was designed to reflect the fact that those islands were not integrated into the Common agricultural policy and , furthermore , because it was not subject to the Community Customs Union , the Community customs rules , nor Value Added Tax .
This is where we fall down , due to the pitiful lack of a similar agreement with the Republic of Cuba .
Let me highlight some of these .
The Commission cannot alter the criteria in the Treaty ; we have the duty to see them applied and that is what we have done .
I consider the constant interference by Morocco to be unacceptable .
The second thing that I think is important , which has also been mentioned , but I would like to reiterate it , is the need for greater transparency in this type of mechanism , which requires increased participation by Parliament .
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services ?
I believe that this compromise demonstrates the enormous importance that all of us who have participated in the discussion attach to the issue of energy efficiency , as well as considerable agreement on the objectives of this piece of legislation .
And thirdly , because Mr Juncker spoke very clearly yesterday , at the summit with the United States , when he used a phrase that filled me with pride and emotion : &apos; Europe is not on its knees &quot; .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.45 and resumed at 12.00 )
I therefore believe , Mr President , that there is still a long way to go .
I shall now turn to the second amendment . On the basis of criteria derived from marine geology and biology , this amendment calls for the protected areas proposed by the Commission to be replaced by the 200-mile mile political criterion . It should be pointed out that , rightly or wrongly , that criterion is no longer relevant to fisheries management under Community law .
I had presented an amendment in this regard .
We all agree that renewable energies have to play a key role in guaranteeing our supply of energy , as well as making us less dependent on imports and in fulfilling the commitments we gave in Kyoto .
To sum up , monetarist ideology must not be allowed to dominate to the detriment of our citizens &apos; social and political rights .
It is also essential to emphasis the crucial role played by the better regulation principles , i.e. proper impact assessments , the cost-effectiveness effectiveness principle or appropriate lead-times times , in creating a competitive regulatory framework for the automotive industry .
Nor do we intend to support the PPE-DE DE Group &apos; s Amendment 29 , the objective of which is to rehash a debate that has no place here .
I am basically referring to the principles whereby the Member States should define and delimit the supply and content of the public service licences taken up by the corresponding public bodies , and should have the freedom to choose the funding model , thereby avoiding any distortions to free competition .
Firstly , I should stress that the appropriate polices for ensuring the stability of the energy supply are being adequately applied and coordinated at international , Community and national levels and , naturally , we must make it very clear that there is absolutely no reason to fear problems with energy supply in the industrialised countries , since the current level of strategic oil reserves , both in the United States and in the European Union or in other OECD countries , will allow us to deal with problems with the supply of crude over a long period of time , should they arise .
These negotiations will allow EU-flagged flagged vessels to fish in Mauritanian waters based on a principle of surplus stocks as described in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .
You have also spoken this morning of the problem of human rights .
In accordance with the Association Agreement , negotiations will resume in parallel with the Association Committee on 14 March and , in principle , will be concluded by the end of 2002 at the latest .
I would also like to point out that , in Galicia , the number of &apos; yes &quot; votes in last year &quot; s referendum on the European Constitution was far higher than the average for the rest of Spain .
The EMPA does need to be given what it deserves : the tasks of consultation , monitoring and proposal .
My group has always rejected trade liberalisation and its devastating effects , which are contributing to the current financial , economic , climatic and food crisis .
Guinea is sinking further and further into under-development development .
Mr President , Mrs Schauvliege , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission and the parliamentary delegation , led by our fellow Member Mr Leinen , on the work that they did in Cancún , a meeting that I was unfortunately unable to attend in the end .
My second point - and this is no less important - concerns the question of cohesion .
In that case , it must resolve to put the Community &apos; s house in order .
This proposal , as Mr Poignant has said , includes such subjects as traceability and sensors to monitor how the large vessels that put into our ports manage dumping and bilge cleaning .
Firstly , the &apos; Single Sky &apos; proposal is clearly not going to put an end to all delays .
I was general rapporteur for the 1999 budget and in that report I placed great emphasis - almost a separate report - on the urgent need to resolve the problem of the pensions of European civil servants .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first , like previous speakers , I wish to express my regret at the absence of Commissioner Bonino from a debate of such importance to the fisheries sector .
These are the questions to which answers are needed , Commissioner .
Commissioner , we believe that the reduction in prices should be smaller and more gradual , and should remain coupled to a significant proportion of the aid in order not to unravel the economic and social fabric of the producing areas , which , in my country , are located in the least prosperous regions .
Mr President , despite the resources that the Structural Funds have been devoting for years to furthering territorial balance in the European Union , the 25 richest regions still have a per capita income two and a half times higher than the poorest , and despite the many needs put forward by these least-favoured favoured regions , not all the appropriations earmarked as development funds are actually used each year .
How is it possible that the regions are applying Community legislation and that this is not formally recognised in terms of rights within the institutional framework of the Union ?
This is not , therefore , the time .
We certainly do not wish to take the place of the governments , who will have to take the decisions .
Indeed , as Mr Stevenson has just said , the increase is not being reflected in the price charged by farmers ; they blame the gap between the price paid to them and the price paid by the consumer on a Common Agricultural Policy based on promoting set-aside aside .
Parliament &apos; s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has already debated the placing on the market of animal feed , back in 2006 . We will all recall that we unanimously asked the European Commission , in future review , to endeavour to find a fair balance between the interests of farmers in obtaining detailed information on feed ingredients and the interests of the industry in ensuring sufficient protection of its know-how how .
This is something which concerns me as a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions .
It concentrates on national balances that lead to rivalry and that discourage solidarity . And , to top it all , it suggests cofinancing the CAP , an idea that was rejected by this very House in November and that was even rejected by the government that proposed it to the Council .
Every company , consumer and authority must adapt to this new situation , and the communication being presented today consists of a report on the situation with regard to the preparations for the introduction of coins and notes , but also , as well as assessing the general situation , additional work is being carried out : on the one hand , to establish to what extent the content of the Commission recommendation of last 11 October has been complied with by the Member States and , secondly , to establish a series of good practices , the application of which may contribute to aiding the correct development of operations relating to the introduction of notes and coins .
I would like to point out that many of these languages were banned in certain countries during very recent dictatorships , but democracy has recognized them and has also granted them their own official status .
Madam President , Commissioner , I regret the Council &apos; s absence in today &apos; s debate .
Since then , we have seen numerous international meetings , most notably of the G20 , with a strong presence of European Union Member States .
I think Mr Chichester hit the nail on the head when he said that this advanced technology that is going to be used represents a further opportunity for our industries . It is a new field of industrial activity that we should all take advantage of , because we will have to wait 40 or 60 years , although there are research centres and power stations that will have to be decommissioned at some point .
It is a rigorous , clear and very focused report , which provides us with precise information on how the budget has been implemented .
Thus the balance between the need for the markets to operate effectively and the need for effective movement throughout the European Union should not lead us to abandon essential legal guarantees .
Will the Member States have to waive their right to take part on an individual basis and will there be just one spokesman ?
First , because of the good working relationship with my co-rapporteur rapporteur Mr Tannock , and also because I have had the opportunity to work with a group of extremely competent assistants and officials , and finally because a high level of consensus was reached in the drafting of the report .
Delays were also a feature of the implementation of pre-accession accession aid , especially in the case of the SAPARD programme , where only 9.2 % of the appropriations were disbursed .
Given that a simple reference was made in the resolution to our recent visit to Nicaragua , in order to provide illustrative evidence of the situation in this country , I would like to point out that Nicaragua is currently the poorest country in Continental America .
The very act of resorting to the visibility or otherwise of the design of a component in a complex product , in order to exclude it from protection , demonstrates just how difficult it is to find a concept and a formula to reconcile these interests without causing legal ambiguities and uncertainties .
If things had been done in this way , Mr President , I do not believe that we would now be lamenting the disease suffered by mad cows , or that we would be lamenting certain other examples of food contamination whose future effects are still unknown .
We are therefore reassured to receive the offer of cooperation you made Parliament today , especially in view of the statements to which Mr Poettering referred just now , in which , apparently , you declared that the Commission is an institution suffering from a serious democratic deficit and that , following the 1999 elections and the low turnout of citizens in your country , the European Parliament should be dissolved .
I therefore support the ESDP and my compatriot Mr Novo Belenguer &apos; s excellent report , and I would only wish to restate here what I added to the report in committee : that the European Spatial Development Perspective should go beyond its obvious terrestrial dimension and include the maritime dimension it lacks at present .
With regard to responsibility , as the honourable Member knows , we are working on it and I hope that over the next few weeks we can present , within the Commission and rapidly approved , a proposal to provide a criminal definition of serious negligence in all the Member States of the Union in the event of this type of accident .
This is a key and decisive element for the region . As he says , it is also important for the media in the region to be stable and independent .
Firstly , the agency Frontex , which had a low rate of implementation of the allocated funds , but this should not cause us to be pessimistic .
We will win this battle .
At least unify the criteria - that is what we were after - on the basis of a few basic scientific data .
However , we agree with Mr Gallagher and we share his concern that little or nothing has been done on these inspection and monitoring tasks , so much so that what concerns us most about fishing relations with Equatorial Guinea is that the country may become a flag of convenience as a result of this lack of control , which has already led to sanctions from the ICCAT .
Oil prices and exchange rates are on a roller coaster . President-in in-Office Office of the Council , I very much fear that if this state of affairs continues you will be forced to convene a further summit to assess the European and world economies .
Now it seems that everything is focused around illegal immigration .
As the Commissioner said , this has to be the last tragedy at sea .
That report has now been published , but the substance of our amendments was not included .
There is also likely to be a negative impact on the multilateral trading system .
Mr President , the answer the Commissioner has just given me obliges me to ask that the matter be referred back to committee .
The essence of this kind of violence is deeply rooted in people &quot; s mindsets and in the cultures that suffer from those mindsets , and one year , or one piece of paper , will not be enough to change that .
Mr President , I am aware that Parliament was not very happy with the procedures followed in connection with the conclusion and signature of this agreement .
It has not been visible enough , but it has contained elements that have benefited the people and that have today become a point of reference for a different type of external policy based on cooperation and based on equality .
I would like to say to you , on behalf of the European Union and the Council , that we consider Professor Kostunica to be the leader of the majority of the Serbian people and that it is him who we are going to support and continue to support .
Therefore , Mr Füle , there needs to be a thorough reflection around why the Neighbourhood Policy , in the spirit of the Barcelona Process , has not had the intended democratising effects , and how we could or should make adjustments to it .
However , the figures are not the most important factor , but rather that we must recognise that Europe must change direction and take a qualitative and quantitative leap in order to achieve this objective of being highly competitive in the knowledge-based based society .
Thirdly , the European Union has sought to highlight the link between the effectiveness and efficiency of official development aid and the implementation , by the beneficiaries of aid , of appropriate policies in the political , economic and social fields .
Spain has been sidelined . Its involvement does not seem to be consistent with its government &apos; s support for the war .
I am referring to the ability that many Member States have to evade the European directive requiring an environmental impact assessment for public or private projects in very sensitive areas in the European ecosystem , such as the Alps in this case , or it could be the Pyrenees in Spain .
This would therefore fall to the French Government , should the need arise .
I believe that , following the German Presidency &apos; s success at the Berlin event , that is what we must now be working towards .
It can be applied without any need for bureaucracy .
For many of us , our final vote will depend on the result of the voting on various amendments , but , in its current wording , we prefer the Commission &apos; s text .
Mr President , we wish to present an oral amendment , clarifying the amendment presented by the Members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left .
In my view , the Union must ensure that they receive that support , and promote their full recognition by society .
In other words , you can make fun with examples that we do not even know about right now , because the problem , fundamentally , is that we do not have any common statistical instrument with which to really tackle this issue .
With regard to the proposal for a directive , I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Thomas Mann on the excellent work he has done .
If we want to make European citizenship really meaningful , citizens must see it at work in the first institutional layer that represents it : the town hall .
The text that was finally adopted also guarantees greater respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of consumers to access the Web , by providing legal certainty in Amendment 138 .
It is therefore important for this Parliament to establish a mandate for the members of the delegation representing it and also to establish - and this seems to me to be essential - which political objectives this Parliament will pursue by means of this Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This is not a report that can be approved without a high degree of consensus across the political groups .
Europe &apos; s universities , in France , Spain and elsewhere , are autonomous and have the power to decide whether they will recognise diplomas and the subjects that have been studied .
I am in favour of maintaining resources , among other reasons so that the sector can remain viable in the medium and long term .
Giving Parliament a bigger role and greater participation in issues such as the area of freedom , justice and security is the way in which this treaty has tried to bring the citizens and the institutions closer together .
I appreciate that in some specific cases this may mean of loss of relative advantages in comparison with the country of origin , which reflects the existing differences between the nationals of the different States of the Union .
In his speech , the President of the Commission set out five very clear points that represent genuine requirements of the Union .
In view of this I would like to ask the Commission to pay special attention to the specific problems faced by island territories , for which maritime transport is of particular importance .
Finally , and I will end here , I would like to thank Parliament for its support for the Commission proposal on the granting of macro-financial financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
As I told you two years ago , I belong to that generation - like many of the Spanish Members here - and my personal relationship with the past inevitably determines my memory .
Europe does not want to be a military power .
Politically , too , it seems hard to accept that a neighbouring country that enjoys privileged access to our internal market and takes part in a large number of our programmes and other activities should grant such tax favours .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Patsy Sörensen , for the care and accuracy of her report .
Madam President-in in-Office Office of the Council , there is a lack of specific proposals .
I think that it is our obligation to help and support them whenever it is possible for us to do so .
In spite of the excessive secrecy surrounding debates of this kind , we know that only a few countries are opposed to such a step , notably France , which , it seems , is making this decision dependent on an end to the embargo on exporting arms to China .
We must defend it in memory of the thousands of people tortured and murdered , remembering in particular what happened last year with the summary execution of several innocent people .
It is essential that our Asian partners see us as an economic , industrial , scientific and cultural power , but also that they appreciate our process of continental integration and the democratic values and solidarity on which this process is based .
There are now many more poor people than there were a year ago , tens of millions more .
Ladies and Gentlemen , I would like to ask that in this matter , also taking into account the fact that the Commission is going to support Amendment No 16 by Mr Sterckx - I will refer to the rest of the amendments later - you accept the initial draft .
In this regard , I believe that Mr Lamy is being asked , by means of travelling diplomacy - not an exploratory mission - to find a solution by means of what we in the European Union institutions call the confessionary system , that is to say , to try , by means of bilateral meetings amongst the interlocutors , to talk about things that nobody dare raise at a table , either in the green room or in the general meeting .
This is just one of the examples which do not stand up .
It is true that it is an economic activity that involves a natural resource which must be protected .
We do not have a Constitution in force ; a Constitution that includes a Minister for Foreign Affairs , allows decisions to be made by qualified majority and enables the Council to call upon a group of countries to carry out the mission which is now going to be carried out by certain Member States .
Tell us what it involves and we will help you .
This has an impact on both the content and on interinstitutional relations .
However , I believe that the European Parliament is currently giving some very good advice .
Mr President , the excellent report presented by Mr Fernández Albor on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs might give rise to some specific comments and a few examples .
The scheduling of the next summit in Mexico in 2004 guarantees the continuity of this process of strengthening and consolidating the bi-regional regional association .
In certain Commission departments there is almost administrative paralysis , which we urgently need to resolve .
Consequently , as a general principle , Mr President , we should be unyielding on general principles but as flexible as possible on specific applications .
Unfortunately , more often than not , the jobs are poorly paid and insecure .
Last year the European Parliament and the US Congress made a promising start .
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group , for example , has tabled amendments which may affect the internal market .
I refer once again to the debates we have often had in this House in recent years on the importance of reliable budget data , or reliable data for other national public accounts , GDP etc . , or the need to have a price index upon which the public can fully rely .
It is clear that a great effort has been made to introduce new issues and to take new steps in European audiovisual policy .
In view of the expected restructuring , I should like to ask specifically for a unit to be set up for large migratory species , the need for which has already been noted by the Commission insofar as it has drawn up a number of regulations just for these species , which are the main target for flags of convenience , a pirate scourge that inexplicably is spreading ever more widely .
Contrary to what the rapporteur said and wrote in his report , I think that such a request is absurd and , what is more , is extremely detrimental to the fishermen concerned .
The Council has told us today that it has made a budget of ECU 15 million available for the promotion of a programme of linguistic diversity within the Union .
The prohibition of the pact has also been accepted by the national courts , Mrs Kroes .
After the encouraging speech given by President Musharraf on 12 January , New Delhi reacted with a sense of historical opportunity to this conciliatory gesture by Pakistan and agreed to stop military mobilisation .
A number of studies have calculated that if we achieve the goal of a 20 % share of renewable energy sources , it will mean that 2.8 million European workers will be employed in the sector by 2020 .
Macroeconomic policies must be geared towards the need to promote short-term term growth and at the same time preserve macroeconomic stability .
I wish you a fruitful presidency and we in Parliament offer you our cooperation .
But we are discussing these matters towards the end of 1996 .
At first reading we presented certain amendments that we have not wanted to reproduce at second reading , in honour of the Commissioner .
If the European Union cannot protect its own borders in a joint fashion , then what is the Union for ?
Mr President , I too should like to welcome this proposal for a regulation from the Commission which improves upon certain control measures within NAFO .
With regard to combating doping , my feeling is that , since the World Anti-Doping Doping Agency was created , there is almost less control in this area then there was before . I would like to hear the Commissioner &apos; s opinion on this and on whether she believes it is necessary to rather reinvigorate the fight against doping at European level and , if possible , at world level .
The proposal for a directive individualises employment relations ( through the opt-out out clause ) , so that employers and workers can agree to increase the working week to as much as 60 hours .
A European day against the death penalty - as Mr Méndez de Vigo was saying , and I agree with him - is a good idea , but it is not enough .
Therefore , for us to abandon them to their fate would be a mistake and would make us accomplices , whether active or passive , to the Burmese dictatorship .
I congratulate the rapporteur and I am pleased that , both in the annual report by the Commission and in the report by Parliament , it is stressed that just four Member States have complied 100 % with the requirements for the corresponding boxes in all segments of the fleet .
Because of its economic significance , and the number of jobs it creates , this is not just another figure but part of the strategic resources which are vital for such support to enable the industry to survive in the outlying regions , which suffer from the highest rates of unemployment in the Union and are all areas under Objective 1 on account of their low level of income .
On behalf of the hundreds of millions of human beings whose rights are denied or restricted as a result of fundamentalist pressure , I would like to thank the European Parliament .
This is therefore a clear case of non-compliance compliance with Community law .
It goes without saying that we also support all the work being done by the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , Mr Óscar Arias , and accordingly we also hope that , once the aforementioned measures are in place , elections can be held in November 2009 with full transparency and with total respect for the democratic system and for human rights .
We agree , Mr Tajani , that in order to be successful it is essential that there is standardisation of infrastructures and charging methods .
Secondly , a revision of the scheme for an accelerated phasing out of single-hull hull oil tankers , by reducing the maximum permitted age of vessels and bringing forward the deadlines for abolishment with regard to those originally proposed by the measures in the Erika I package , in order to increase protection of the marine environment , thereby incorporating the Commission &apos; s original proposals in the so-called called Erika I package .
What legislation we produce , its quality , the issues it deals with , its relevance , how good it is : &apos; better regulation &quot; is a fashionable issue .
I agree that there may be discrepancies in exceptions regarding the type of ship or devices for measuring the length of ships .
The CAP should not be measured merely in terms of expenditure because , in addition to the goods and services it provides , I believe it should be made clear - today of all days - that EUR 1 invested in agriculture generates EUR 10 of wealth in the agri-food food sector .
These are the approaches we are working on and on which we are going to work until the end .
Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries . Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , I wish to express our rejection of this emergency procedure , which the Council requested of Parliament on 18 January and which asks us to deliver our opinion before 14 February .
All this should take place within the context of an endogenic dynamic and external aid , as we have requested of the Commission , should therefore be devoted to strengthening basic organisations , urban and rural citizens &apos; associations , local NGOs and traditional social institutions , more than to direct aid to the budgets of the countries receiving aid .
In accordance with current legislation , the Commission currently sends us , together with its drafts , a balance sheet that includes what is basically a multiannual proposal for budgetary programming corresponding to the draft .
I think these questions deserve careful consideration .
This is why we expect more from the Commission in terms of its proposals , and I would say that this report is apt for that very reason .
This is a point that we as the Commission , however , do not see in quantitative , but in qualitative terms , and we focus on our broad economic policy guidelines to highlight the importance of these issues .
Some political prisoners have been freed , but the authoritarian structures are still in place there .
From my modest position , I am calling on my colleagues to take serious account of this issue when voting today .
From the Community viewpoint , we are going to use EUR 30 000 million which will be , in practice , mobilised by the European Investment Bank , and in respect of the EUR 5 000 million which belongs , strictly speaking , to the Community budget , we are encountering major problems .
We certainly do not know how they act and above all we do not understand their sense of time .
If you accept these objectives , representatives of the Council and the Commission , you can count on us to be great allies .
It is true that there are sectors that have done the right thing and can and should continue to do so , but in order for them to do the right thing , there needs to be tuna .
In other words , what we are doing is converting into Community law - or making a proposal that they become Community law - the rules and standards which , in the negotiations , it has been agreed to require of the candidate countries .
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative .
Today we learned of the death , very near to where I live , of another person who worked of his own free will in the world of politics : a local councillor .
We were all convinced of this , but there were times when it seemed that that truth was not so evident to many people in the world .
Firstly , with regard to the activities for 9 May , as you know , in cooperation with the chairman of the eurogroup , it has been agreed to communicate the 9 May initiative relating to schools to the Ecofin Council , in Malmö , and the Commission will print 400 000 little passports which our delegations will make available to the schools so that the children can begin to familiarise themselves with this situation .
I think that , as Mr Heaton-Harris Harris has already mentioned , the European Union is above all a customs union , and so the customs code is an important component to allow it to function .
At present , however , the Castro brothers &apos; dictatorship is characterised by a lack of compassion for political prisoners and prisoners of conscience , and for their own people .
However , one interesting point to be stressed is the problem of payment systems , particularly in retail operations .
The second point which I believe is relevant and has not been mentioned is the need to guarantee and consolidate the direct effect of Article 8A . If Articles 8 and 8A are purely supplementary legal bases for the adoption of the rules of derived law , then the right of movement and residence of the citizens of the Union is based on the Treaty itself and not on the directives .
In 2002 , in the absence of a definitive decision on the location of the Agency &apos; s headquarters , Denmark temporarily hosted the secretariat of CEPOL , having previously obtained a budget of EUR 2.2 million for 2002 to be used to finance 17 training operations .
Secondly , our group considers it necessary to abstain because its two amendments on time limits for the end of marketing and for the end of experimentation have not been accepted .
I am convinced that it will serve as an inspiration to your courageous husbands , just as the interest of the free world was an inspiration for me during the darkest times of my imprisonment .
Firstly , it is not possible to set up a project without highlighting the great weaknesses of those countries such as , for example , water and desertification .
Well , I think we could at least move into the front row without pushing Mr Liikanen out of his seat , which is rightfully his . That way we would be a bit cosier .
We propose basically to make decisive progress in three areas .
Mr President , Europe is entering a stage which will be crucial to its future . A new political impetus is urgently required .
I want to point out that there is a whole series of issues which , either because of international commitments , such as fisheries agreements , or multilateral obligations , such as the need to transpose the recommendations of the regional fisheries organisations into Community law , should appear in the legislative programme .
My Group supports the rapporteur &apos; s report and if we tabled amendments it was purely with a view to improving it .
I am going to discuss these by referring to Mr Clegg &apos; s report .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Charter of Fundamental Rights has enabled us to take a great step towards the reconstruction of a Europe of the citizens ; this is what Mr Méndez de Vigo likes to tell us ; this is what we have heard on many occasions from Professor Rodríguez Bereijo , the representative named by the Head of the Spanish Government , Mr José María Aznar , for the convention drafting the Charter .
I simply wish to thank the Commissioner for his comments and make it very clear that , naturally , the question referred to Catholic priests , but this affects all non-orthodox orthodox Christian denominations given that there is still a certain tradition ( if I may put it that way ) of territorial monopoly which is not compatible with the right to religious freedom .
It is clear , however , that we cannot ignore the importance of free trade , which is something that the Central American and Andean countries are asking for , and in that regard , my only recommendation , Mr President , is that this ambitious timetable that the Commissioner has told us about , given that the Commission has approved the negotiation guidelines and Parliament is going to approve them tomorrow as well , can be given substance as soon as possible , because we have already waited too long for the Andean and Central American Communities to have association agreements , like those with Mexico and Chile , which have produced excellent results , by the way .
As such , the European Commission will have no authority to initiate any proceedings in the International Criminal Court .
There must therefore be an end to this policy of continuing to build the wall within the occupied territories , of ordering extra-judicial judicial executions and , furthermore , there must be a withdrawal from Gaza , to which the current Israeli Government has clearly committed itself .
Mr President , I wish to inform the House of the appearance in the Spanish media last week of a document from the European Commission &quot; s Environment Directorate-General General on the Spanish Government &quot; s National Hydrological Plan and its funding by the European Union .
All of this will provide greater coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes , into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme , which we will be discussing soon .
I believe that Europe must respond firmly and quickly to these infringements of European directives .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and on the level of consensus reached in the House , which is something that has not been easy .
That is : &apos; reviewing the chain of accountability in cases of alleged internal corruption and fraud within the Community institutions ... &apos;
This does not only depend on you , clearly . It also depends on the non-EU EU states that are members of the various multilateral organisations .
Mr President , in our view , we must not forget that greater fleet capacity does not guarantee employment .
I believe that was not a point of order , but a matter of courtesy .
There is a declaration in the Treaty of Amsterdam which says that legislation must be clear , concise and aimed at a specific problem .
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments .
I welcome the fact that the resolution asks the Commission to include compliance with EU-equivalent equivalent standards in terms of the environment , animal welfare and food safety and quality in trade negotiations with EU partners .
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party and speaking quite plainly and in accordance with my duty to be strictly fair , I must begin by stressing the quality of the report submitted by Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn Urbahn on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
Despite the amendments presented - and there have been many - proposing indicative targets , this Parliament , both in the Industry Committee and in the Environment Committee , has approved making the targets obligatory by a huge majority .
That is absolutely absurd .
This is because , Mr Zapatero , Europe is more than just the sum of the domestic successes of its governments , including those that you may have had .
What a wonderful achievement for the welfare of animals !
It should be said in the Council &apos; s defence that this action plan represents an attempt to adopt a global approach to a problem which Parliament had already highlighted in a resolution on this issue dated 15 January 1998 .
In this respect I would like to urge the President of Parliament and Parliament as a whole to continue in their political efforts to promote the institution of Parliament as the supreme organ of democratic debate and codecision that can rise above questions of mere detail and of simply defending a few specific positions .
The European Union has invested a lot , has devoted resources and effort to the creation of that Authority and believes that it must be maintained , so that one day there may be a viable and democratic Palestinian State .
We need immediate measures when the event occurs , such as opening airports at night without additional costs and looking after the public , the passengers , properly ; but we also need compensation .
For the referendum to lead to the fulfilment of those objectives , however , the preparatory work must be done with great care , especially the correct compilation of the full electoral roll , which has still not been achieved , and strict fulfilment of the criteria governing its compilation must be insisted on .
In any case , my dear Mr Tillich , Mr President , if we were to ask a normal person whether they had understood any of this , I think the answer would be no .
This means that the Commission is unable to have a body of inspectors who would take action in the Member States and clearly denounce any violations .
The Tempus programme - or , in this specific case , the extension of the scope of the Tempus programme proposed by the Council - should be seen as part of a strategy seeking to bolster dialogue and understanding between the peoples and cultures of the European Union and the Mediterranean .
This is why , at its meeting in October 1997 , the Council asked the Commission to carry out a study - a cost-benefit benefit analysis - on fisheries agreements .
The Socialist Group calls on the Commission to promote the best possible scientific opinions in order to provide knowledge at all times of the state of each resource in each fishing ground so that , on the basis of these rigorous scientific opinions , we can implement recovery plans , which may or may not involve drastic measures which - we must not forget - always lead to the scrapping of ships , unemployment for fishermen and other workers dependent on the fishing sector , and furthermore represent a serious blow for those European regions most dependent on fishing .
For this reason , the informal Council in Toledo agreed to research and provide this information , so that we can have a thorough debate , and hopefully reach a unanimous position on this matter , which would be very desirable .
What are we going to ask of the European citizens when we ask them to support the European Constitution ?
Tomorrow Parliament will be voting on the corresponding report , in which we express our support for the proposals of the Council and Commission for future legislation in this field .
The question was on measures to be adopted by the Council and , in particular , we queried whether the Austrian Presidency has any plans to ensure that the Council will indeed be present at meetings of the Committee on Petitions .
Allow me to make a final comment : as has been said , it is the case that structural reforms are difficult to launch and implement in an environment of low growth , but it is also the case that the countries that are growing most are the countries that have carried out reforms , as has been said in the debate .
We have elections in a year &apos; s time , and we need to know how to get there , which means improving our information procedures and continuing to be transparent , as we are being .
The Commission principally defines three initiatives for achieving greater efficiency : on the one hand , making the decision-making making process more dynamic , focussing the activity of the &quot; MED Committee &quot; on strategic planning and programming .
There should also be support for the initiatives , for example , with translations .
I believe it is very important that the Spanish Presidency takes the helm once again , places Latin America on the continent &apos; s navigation charts and , like in the Fifteenth Century , supports , in this new era , the link between the European Union and Latin America .
Do you not think that if Mr Aznar were to include this issue in his agenda once again , if he were to pick up the telephone , if he were to establish political contact at a high level , this issue - which affects at least 17 Spanish families that have already been allocated children - the barriers would be removed , as has been the case for the Americans ?
Reference is made to imposing taxes .
- Mr President , by this stage in the debate it seems to me that three things must already be clear to us .
Statements to the effect that those who do not agree , for example , with the Group of the European People &quot; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , or with the exiles in Miami , are on the side of Castro , are exactly the kind of things we have heard from the White House , saying that those who questioned the US position on Iraq were automatically allied with Saddam Hussein .
Although we all agree on the basic question , and the importance and value of the objective , opinions are still divided - that is true of my group - about the best way of achieving it .
The Commission fully approves the joint position of the Council , which now includes the various amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading .
However , I would like to point out that measures as important as those that we are dealing with today require more time for reflection and consideration ; the tight margin for manoeuvre that we have had as a result of the deadlines imposed is totally inadequate .
The principle of capillarity : that it be communicated to all the players present .
The fact is , however , that this is a decision by the Court of International Trade of a foreign power - the United States - which may have the effect of restricting the Community &apos; s exports , and the Council can do one of two things : either it can take no action , or it can take action .
He is wearing the scarf of Schalke 04 , a team that achieved a glorious victory , but with the help of one of the best players in the world , the Spaniard , Raúl .
It does not seem reasonable to continue with the current situation , where most or all computerized information services are offered exclusively in English , because that is an assault on the linguistic diversity of the Union , and an obstacle to the corresponding language industries , which are so important .
Therefore , we cannot accept Amendments Nos 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 nor part of Nos 28 , 29 , 30 and part of No 31 .
I shall refer to three factors that seem to me to be fundamental to achieving a strong network of enterprises .
Resources should henceforth come directly from the citizen .
The sad reality is that 70 % of the amount produced is still unsold and will therefore have to go into intervention , which is very exceptional in this sector .
It is true that we are leaving a margin of flexibility for the Member States , but it is also certain that , theoretically , 0.01 , although it is a contribution , is not necessarily a significant contribution .
It is difficult because , in an ever more complex society , you will frequently find different interpretations as to the legal parameters of the companies being expressed .
Creators are therefore the first interested party and we should not forget this , as it is one of the distinguishing features of European culture .
We therefore request the Council to show political responsibility and coherence .
In order to reduce these deficiencies , it has been proposed to use the information available within the framework of the above-mentioned mentioned Regulation ( EC ) No 2390 / 1999 in the integrated administration system , which Mr Casaca spoke about earlier in this magnificent report .
We therefore have to re-establish establish order , by supporting the legitimate government of Somalia so that it can take back control of the whole country and establish a rule of law which respects human rights .
What I say is : we have had enough .
When she negotiated the agreement at the end of 1995 , she was praised for her firm stand , but now we find , as Mr Novo said earlier , that the Commission has accepted a doubling of the biological rest period , with no explanation and virtually no information , purely on the basis of a few catches by a few Community ships .
It even managed to convince the French government of its desire for democracy and to convince Commissioner Pinheiro and President Santer himself to show signs of comprehension by lifting the sanctions which this Parliament had promoted .
I am delighted to inform Mr Alves and everyone that in 8 or 10 days time , a large-scale scale conference is going to be held on the outermost regions , sponsored by the Spanish Presidency .
It is the minimum appropriation necessary for the Agency to carry out the new tasks assigned to it .
What is the government &apos; s decision going to be with respect to the next presidential elections ?
I believe that the report has the virtue , not just of describing issues that need resolution for the sake of the effectiveness of the petition procedure , but also of pointing them out to the European Commission .
The Committee on the Environment had little faith in these voluntary agreements and another amendment asked for the establishment of a clear legal framework which would come into play in the event that the voluntary agreements failed .
In this way we could also cooperate with neighbouring countries in the Mediterranean . An extensive , clean , smart grid is needed to connect to our neighbours in the south who have the potential to generate solar energy using high technology and large-scale scale plants .
I think by and large we all know people who have suffered , and are suffering , from these disorders , which are not illnesses .
Some of you have suggested that the Bank should pay greater attention to environmental factors .
Although the time I have is very brief , I must tell the Commissioner that regardless of what we or the Commission might think about case-law law or the law in force , it is under an obligation to implement the Treaties and move ahead , and that it has no authority to hold any rule or anything which may affect the Community acquis in abeyance .
As regards Mr Viola &apos; s report , I would like to say that I think it is very important to pay attention to the problems experienced by islands .
Nevertheless , we must be honest , not only with ourselves , but also with our citizens .
If only our initiative were to cease to be necessary tomorrow and we could all return to our peaceful daily lives .
In Spain , in my region of Aragon , we are pioneers of renewable energy sources , with almost 60 % energy independence .
Europe 2020 must offer both a mid-term term vision and short-term term action .
You will recall that in Gothenburg the Swedish Presidency tried to reach an agreement over headquarters ; that in Laeken , the Belgian Presidency tried once again , and put forward a proposed agreement on headquarters , which was blocked by not only one , but by various countries at the same time .
I congratulate you on the decision you took to resume the sitting and you have the support of the majority of the groups through our group presidents .
Furthermore , the Commission will continue working both in the field of revising the trans-European European networks and in fostering intermodal and coastal trade programmes .
in that it has a great deal to do with the EU &apos; s priorities : energy and the fight against climate change ;
Let me turn to the main conclusions of the report and start by making some comments on recent budgetary developments and prospects .
We are linked to both parties by means of Association Agreements and treaties which imply reciprocal friendship and cooperation .
And we must add 1.5 % to that average of the three : that is the reference value .
We have also raised the issue of sensitive areas within this forum , as requested by some of the ladies and gentlemen here present , as well as the issue of prohibiting the carriage of heavy oils in any single-hull hull ship , not simply , as is currently the case , with regard to our ports and anchorage areas , but also with regard to any other international port .
Work has been carried out in recent years to update this system and an improved text is now pending approval by the Council .
I would like to point out that we still oppose certain amendments which could affect or prejudice the institutional operative reality .
I would like to end , Mr President , by calling upon the honourable Members to vote in favour of the proposed report , and I thank you for listening .
As I did not understand the answer , I would like to repeat my question .
My group , Commissioner , will therefore work in Parliament and the Committee on Fisheries as of today , the day on which we have seen the texts , together with the sector , together with the other groups represented in Parliament , listening to anyone who wants to talk to us to work towards a reform that is gradual , that is established by consensus and that is properly financed , because we believe that a sector of the vital strategic importance of fishing in the European Union cannot be condemned to die out .
For those of us who are speaking here tonight on behalf of our native regions , this is a very negative view , and , of course , a deeply mistaken one .
In my opinion , it does the peace process no favours for one of the parties involved to pick a fight with one of the other negotiators .
We shall vote on whether to suspend the plenary sitting of Parliament until Mr Borloo arrives .
We do not have a single weapon .
It is not a simple formal amendment ; its content is very significant . We therefore oppose the oral amendment .
Mr President , I took the floor yesterday in plenary to highlight the importance of the Stockholm Programme , which is on the agenda for the European Council on 10 December .
Readiness to correct is a sign of wisdom . There is a willingness to amend the draft constitution in this regard .
In relation to Amendments Nos 9 , 20 , 27 and 28 , on the Administrative Board , I must say that we accept Amendments Nos 9 and 27 , insofar as they eliminate the presence of Parliament and , if these amendments are incorporated , we will have to make the necessary adjustments .
A herder of &apos; goats and sorrows &apos; , he was a contemporary of Neruda and Aleixandre , winners of the Nobel Prize .
Shall we wait another year ?
We support the peace-keeping keeping of Euskadi and we support peace-keeping keeping in Europe .
Our group has always supported , and will continue to support , the establishment of an International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity but , until this court becomes operational , any proceedings aimed at prosecuting dictators are to be considered very positive in this sense .
The European Parliament is well aware of this fact since it has always been on the front line in promoting the European Union &apos; s efforts to achieve this essential objective for human rights and justice .
We will also be forced to undertake an evaluation process to learn from the experience . The main aim of the exercise will be to ensure we comply with the European model and with fundamental rights .
In this regard , and I wish to reiterate this point as clearly as possible , the Spanish Presidency is totally committed to the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , particularly Article 8 , and fully recognises the legitimate concerns expressed by Parliament .
Now we have 27 Member States .
And to cap it all , they call for strikes to hinder the work of a summit which tried , fortunately successfully , to give fresh impetus to the measures agreed in Tampere and to fight those who deal in and traffic human beings .
The European Parliament has often reiterated the need for the European Union to play a solid role on the international stage and to be able to speak consistently in that context .
Therefore I think that the rapporteur &apos; s recommendations that we opt for a directive seem far more appropriate .
Article 2 of that agreement establishes , by common agreement , the importance of respect for human rights and democratic principles .
If , for example , you travel by car and cross the border between Germany and France , nobody asks you to identify yourself nor to say whether you are crossing the country .
Its proposals , such as those that correct the most unfair aspects of the Commission &apos; s proposal , may have favourable consequences .
We have had experience of this recently in the Committee on Legal Affairs .
It goes without saying that this situation needs to be improved .
We entirely support any action you may take with a view to supporting the policy of Kofi Annan and we believe this is a very decisive step .
The institutions need to work together at this time so that the move towards government of the Union and resolving the fundamental problems that have emerged can be consolidated . Let this be an expression of our commitment to beginning a new political phase in the EU that is beneficial to citizens , who are expecting us to do so .
I would therefore like once again to ask you to support this Commission proposal and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Jarzembowski , and the whole team which has worked on this text , and all the Members of Parliament for your attention .
This is no time for getting caught up in procedural questions that will put this initiative on hold .
I simply want to reply to the honourable Member that I have taken good note of his suggestions to the Presidency and that we will always be prepared to contribute to the European Union taking on an increasingly active role in relation to disabled people and , in particular , in relation to the United Nations Convention on disability .
In times of plenty , the budget is boring .
My conclusion , therefore , Mr President , is that the citizens of Europe currently expect us , the European politicians , to promote the process of ratifying the European Constitution so that we may soon have the appropriate instruments for fighting this scourge .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report unanimously approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 25 April on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever proposes an early diagnosis system and maintenance of the Community method for controlling the disease and slaughter , since not enough progress has yet been made on marker vaccines .
Political areas , such as the Member States , have parties that provide cohesion : France , Spain , Italy , Germany ... all have national parties .
Nor would we like to have to repeat that these accidents take place mainly in work carried out on scaffolding , platforms and high places .
We must firmly denounce the barbarities of our past without diminishing them , much less falsifying them ; without falling into the Manichean logic of the Cold War , equating the West with good and Eastern Europe with evil .
I would ask him not to spend more than one minute in tabling the procedural motion .
I do not know whether it is the fault of Latin America or the Mediterranean countries , for example , that their programmes have a low level of implementation , but I do know that their needs are real .
Mr President , I will reply quickly .
Focusing on the idea of making cooperation policy conditional on the level of respect for human rights also seems particularly positive to me , as do the references made to protecting the most disadvantaged groups , such as women or unaccompanied minors .
I would even go as far as to say that it would reduce the European Union &apos; s authority if the people thought that their own world was going to be subject to these directives .
Otherwise , we shall be forced once again to mouth immodest and unreal phrases , that could even be qualified as gracious , as presented by Mr van Mierlo , over the fact that US diplomacy is sometimes wearied when Europe fails to act .
The last point you have raised is : to what extent can the European Parliament be involved in the granting of this medium-term term aid for balances of payments ?
The other day , the Commission told the Committee on Budgets that , with the euro , inflation is dead .
There was concern about the way the Summit was being managed - it did not even appear in the programme for the current six-month month period - with moments of confusion , suspense and abundant rumour-mongering mongering , which were incompatible with the seriousness and rigour which should be expected from the European Union given the importance of this historic meeting , the first to be held at the highest level between European and African leaders .
To remove the reference , as in Amendment No 2 of the report , to the concern about the dominant position which the former monopolies maintain within liberalisation processes , seems unacceptable to us ; to remove the Commission &apos; s phrase that lays done that services must be provided at an accessible price , does not seem acceptable .
I would like to remind you of some of the aspects of the text which will be put to the vote on Thursday .
Furthermore , with regard to the cuts to aid for exports , and particularly for exports of beef , I believe that the COM is still open and the Doha round will tell us what the solution must be when it closes .
Mrs Bauer , I am very disappointed with the way in which you have carried out this debate and this negotiation .
That is my way of feeling and being European , with the admiration I hold for your country , and I hope this does not happen .
In light of this resolution , which was unanimously supported by the Security Council , we are calling on the European Commission and the Council to do the same . We want the Commission , Parliament and the Council to clearly set out in one document - in a resolution - their support for the Secretary-General General of the United Nations and for the efforts being made .
The second lesson is that those operators who committed themselves to cofunding but failed to deliver should not be allowed to participate in the new programmes .
If one thing characterises the people of the Mediterranean , it is the wealth of their thought and their words , and that , ladies and gentlemen , costs very little .
When we are eight months away from the final ban on driftnets , when this species has just been subject to a TAC and when the ICCAT &apos; s 1999 scientific report expressly warns against this so-called called &apos; experimental &apos; fishing , the Commission &apos; s intention is quite simply irresponsible , and the tactic of transplanting a recommendation in one paragraph in order to remove its content in the next one is unacceptable .
To this end , I believe that we should all do our bit to create speedy assessment mechanisms for these kinds of works , in order to prevent that damage .
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Council is today the only institution to have published a preliminary report on its 2009 accounts for the general public to see .
Let me take this minute to explain an idea , an idea that will not be a panacea but will offer genuine assistance to European citizens in third countries .
We agreed this between the Council and Parliament .
If I am elected , I will represent the diversity of Parliament and firmly promote its role in relation to the other Community institutions .
It is the opinion of the Court that the accounts for 2001 reliably reflect the revenue and expenditure and the financial situation of the Communities .
This is a problem that has not been resolved and , until it is resolved , the international financial institutions - the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - will not be able to help democratic Serbia .
Nanotubes may behave in the human body in a manner similar to asbestos fibres .
That is the contribution of the Stability Pact .
I think Parliament &apos; s attitude should also be stressed .
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application .
Member of the Commission . Mr Paleckis , when , during the first half of this year , Lithuania , at the same time as Slovenia , asked the Commission and the European Central Bank to issue an opinion on their degree of compliance with the criteria laid down in the Treaty for membership of the Monetary Union , the Commission &apos; s response , which was subsequently backed by the Council , was unfortunately negative in the case of Lithuania and positive in the case of Slovenia .
President Abbas , honourable Members , the European Parliament is very honoured that you are here today with us , and the massive attendance at this plenary sitting is evidence of that .
Mr Tsatsos &apos; report is so flexible that it explicitly acknowledges that such European political parties , however set up and bearing in mind the multinational nature of whatever form they may think appropriate , may object to the existence of programmes and actions with a European dimension .
Ladies and gentlemen of Parliament , Latin America is silently becoming disillusioned with democracy .
Nevertheless , Mr Weber , you have acknowledged that we are moving towards a world in which television must be redefined , a world in which television means conventional television as we know it , but also television via the Internet , television via mobile phone and television via all the new technologies .
As far as labelling is concerned , the inclusion of two other details is proposed : the origin of the oil , namely the place where the olives were grown , and in the case of ordinary oil , a requirement to state that it is produced from refined and virgin oils .
I am not going to talk about the debate underway in the United States , but it is odd , and it has already been said , that here civilians seem for the first time to be launching a military coup against the military forces , since those who have had military responsibilities , including in this field , are the most cautious when it comes to dealing with this issue .
What we need at the moment is more employment and more productivity .
Parliament intends to monitor closely the transposition and application of the directive in national legislations , and I have therefore included two recommendations , two reminders to the Commission , which I hope will be approved tomorrow , not within the framework of the directive , but within the framework of the legislative resolution ; one on the procedures for the detection and withdrawal of illicit material , and another on the drafting of codes of conduct .
In any event , the time limit of 18 months is excessively short to carry out such a study . We need two years as a minimum .
This is not very orthodox , it is true , but it could be accepted , since there is an exception laid down in the article of the Agreement .
on behalf of the PPE-DE DE Group . - Mr President , esteemed Prime Minister , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I want to thank the Prime Minister of Spain for his thoughts on the direction of the European Union .
The reform of the fisheries policies is more than simply drawing up legislation .
Mr Quintela is responsible for half - or more - of the problems which have been created in this building .
That is something different .
It is absolutely intolerable that we should leave a group of human beings to die while the governments and bureaucracies of various Members States argue about who is obliged to rescue these shipwrecked people who are dying from starvation , from drowning , from exposure to the sun ...
We can therefore tackle this new phase with confidence and optimism , but we should also do it with the same determination and with the understanding that what is good for Economic and Monetary Union is good for the European Union as a whole , for all of its Member States and all of its citizens .
Having made these initial comments , I would like to deal with the two problems mentioned in the report .
Madam President , I , like previous speakers , welcomed what Mr Monti said , pointing out that as long ago as 1994 the Commission presented a document on the islands . He mentioned , moreover , a whole series of programmes which dealt with the islands , above all the Agenda 2000 of the Filoxenia Programme to enable these regions to develop for the purposes of tourism .
But , above all , we need decisive action on the part of the European Union , the Member States and the whole of the international community in order to put an end to diamond trafficking in the area .
The destructive power of the 640 million small and light arms that there are in the world , 74 % of which are in the hands of civilians , has proven to be more lethal than that of nuclear bombs , and it constitutes one of the main driving forces behind public insecurity both nationally and internationally .
Of course , during the transition period , and until all products have been fully liberalised , the agreement will be more beneficial to Mexico than the European Union , but this asymmetry also takes account of the levels of development and competitiveness of the European economy as compared with Mexico &apos; s .
Their aim is to extend the right to sickness benefit to frontier workers , and if I have understood correctly , to expand the Regulation to cover early retirement benefit .
It is also important to make adequate financial resources available in the European Union &apos; s budget on a regular and permanent basis .
Until the proposal for its new common organisation of markets is tabled , the sector will continue to have almost no room for manoeuvre when setting prices . The rules on imports , many of which originate with illegal fishing , remain unfair competition for EU production : new monitoring obligations require companies to mobilise more of their resources and the general crisis does not exactly encourage increased consumption of quality products .
Firstly , the and studies carried out by the Commission for each protocol show that the agreements are still bringing benefits that are greater than the cost to the European Union and , at the same time , due to their new status as association agreements , we need to take account of other parameters which cannot be measured by means of a mere cost-benefit benefit analysis .
In this first speech I have been asked to give you some brief information about Operation Artemis , the operation currently being carried out by the European Union in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , in the region of Ituri and more specifically in the city of Bunia .
Oral Amendment 2 and Compromise Amendment 5 , adopted in committee , raise the issue of establishing legal assistance only in so far as necessary , and free of charge , at the request of the asylum seeker .
That gave rise to the idea of establishing an independent external advisory body to play an active role in monitoring implementation of the Code of Practice in the European statistical system as a whole .
To sum up , I believe that what we can hope to achieve as a result of the final proposals presented to us by Baroness Ludford and the debate that took place in the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs is that , as far as possible , the House should change the text back to the original Commission proposal and reject many of the amendments that have been adopted , as I have already said , by a chance majority in the Committee on Citizens &apos; Rights .
Flexibility presupposes the introduction into the Community legal order of principles applicable to relations between States under International Law .
I should like , however , to raise a series of questions that have occurred to me regarding Amendments Nos 1 and 2 , which ask that the changes in fishing techniques to be adopted under this proposal should be subsidised under the FIFG .
So , in simpler terms , this proposal for a directive is an instrument that is both necessary and useful to combat one of the many facets - but a very important one - of technological piracy . It is a facet that , through technical devices , facilitates access to encrypted services without paying the legal established fee .
On the other hand , it was also necessary , as I understood it , to establish effective monitoring measures to ensure the uniform application of customs procedures across the whole of the Community and to prevent unfair competition and the opening up of loopholes that could facilitate fraud .
I believe that we , the members of this Parliament , will be able to point to and lay the blame on our own administrations if they do not meet their commitments , but you have to do us the favour of clearly indicating the States and the programmes .
We also need to confront the reality of immigration .
We want greater democracy and greater efficiency .
The European Union has not contributed USD 4000 million , which I believe is what Mr Lange said .
I would stress that immigration does not impact solely or mainly on our security , but on our values and our capacity to correct inequalities at source .
Mr President , I think that the social policy agenda is positive for everyone .
Our job must therefore now be to try to consolidate this Constitution as a basis for subsequent work , but we must work on the basis of what we have agreed , what has been achieved , which is an indication that we are able to act , and this is tremendously important at a time when the European Union was being portrayed as moribund and incapable of taking action .
To this end , we must conclude every one of the association agreements that I have already mentioned and also complete the South-South South integration .
We therefore ask the Commission to set up , together with the competent authorities , a plan to rehabilitate the affected region of Maresme and aimed primarily at the canalization of watercourses , to prevent flooding , and the rebuilding of infrastructures , homes and agricultural installations which have been damaged as a result of this torrential rain .
The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights has said that , in certain countries in the European Union , Roma migrants are not treated in the same way as other European migrants , which is a flagrant violation of the right to free movement .
I am referring , firstly , to the role which should be recognised for women in this new multifunctional mountain farming .
We have always argued that interinstitutional cooperation is the best way to make progress in a budgetary negotiation .
Why was there this disparity ?
This top-level level agreement must be implemented through sectoral agreements in order to combat terror and organised crime .
Moreover , this initiative , which is provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon , also increases the European Union &apos; s credibility in defending human rights , as we are asking not European Union countries but European countries to contribute to strengthening the European Convention on Human Rights .
If those three basic elements - political development , economic development and changes in the situation on the ground - are lacking , it will be very difficult for us to move forward .
author . - Madam President , I would like to begin by expressing my concern at the fact that this item on relations between the European Union and the Cuban Government has replaced , in terms of urgency , another issue that I considered to be far more important and far more urgent : the situation of the refugee population in Iraq .
The European Union must play an active and autonomous role in supporting the peace process .
I would say that in Europe we are currently living in a climate of considerable moral fraud .
Sweden refused him that asylum request and he contacted the Committee on Petitions .
It is therefore difficult to understand why the text that has been negotiated entails a big reduction in the permissible catch of between 25 % and 50 % for almost all categories of fish and why , in addition to the technical measures , conditions have been accepted which for us are difficult to understand .
Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the immediate application of all Community legislation in these regions .
With regard to ports of refuge , I would like to say that compensation for possible damages are an absolutely fundamental feature , and here I agree with Mr Jarzembowski , if EU States are to make ports of refuge available , and this is an absolutely key issue .
This means that we are obliged to make laws for the general interest and not to resolve specific cases involving a minority .
Nevertheless , the limited existing legislation has proved effective in stimulating more sustainable development in many of the Member States , despite the fact that in such important areas as heating and cooling , there is still no legislation at all .
I should like to congratulate your rapporteur once again and thank you for the excellent work you have carried out .
What I do not know is whether the Cuban authorities know that it is much more difficult to preserve and maintain the balance of freedom than to bear the weight of tyranny .
A European coordination mechanism is being set up in this field in the form of a task force in which national political leaders will participate in the area of regulation .
Lack of visibility affects two-wheeled wheeled vehicles and all vehicles in general .
The recommendation was immediately submitted to the rapporteur and certain Members of the European Parliament and forwarded to the Council of the Union .
This includes achieving distribution and greater flexibility in the management of airspace in its civil and military uses - and in certain countries this can be achieved with a certain speed , we have to promote it and we are working on it - and , also in the short term , intervening in the management by airports and air companies of their flight forecasts and the organisation of their flights , in order to improve the use and efficiency of airport slots .
The second reason , Madam President , is that I remember how in Nice there was no solemn proclamation of the Charter .
On a previous occasion in this House , Commissioner Patten said that , in order for the European Union to achieve its objectives - one of the more important of which is for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be respected in all regions of the world - the cooperation of the United States was essential , and likewise the United States &apos; objectives could only be achieved with the cooperation of the European Union .
We have seen how a country which is small in demographic terms can become great in political terms .
Currently , not all Community ports are aware that , directly or indirectly , they are often providing cover for illegal activity .
The European institutions should not only issue generic statements condemning these attacks , but should also promote action along two lines : firstly , ensuring that this tragedy is more present in our societies and our media , and secondly , ensuring that the European institutions are more present where the tragedy is taking place .
The March elections were elections in which the opposition won a majority , and up to 17 July the parliament of that country had still to be formed .
I met him in person at the United Nations shortly before he went to Chile .
In October , the Commission will publish its recommendation on Turkey and will have to adjust its activities in 2005 in accordance with the decision of the European Council scheduled for the end of this year .
And we must not forget that these objectives do not just include maintaining a system in which competition is not distorted , but also the promotion of employment .
Yesterday , the Commission almost unanimously came to the conclusion that Parliament should work on the development of instruments in the second pillar , in other words , the development of the common position that is being adopted at this time .
China , Iraq , Saudi Arabia , the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States are some of the 31 countries in which executions took place .
The aim of all that is to foster the sustainable , peaceful development of the peoples of the world .
The last few months , moreover , particularly in the east of the country , have seen an increase in massacres , rape of little girls and women , and forced recruitment of girls and boys .
I therefore would like to say that we are in favour of the existence of this body , and in favour of drawing on all of its potential , which , in some cases , is achieved , and in other cases is not : obviously , there are certain situations in which , as a result of the votes that take place , the European Union and its Member States do not achieve all their objectives .
I do not understand why there is so much fear and reticence about accepting a European approach to an issue that cannot be seen in any other way .
Our positions are perfectly well known and I do not know if it is worth repeating them .
I should also like to highlight the efforts made by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to clarify rules and simplify procedures without overlooking the importance of reaching agreement amongst the various groups .
We Socialists are rather concerned about the protection of the rights of shareholders .
We all agree on this , both on this side and on the other side of the Atlantic .
She was the victim of an assault but was then powerless against her attacker . President-in in-Office Office of the Council , you must be aware that , in Spain , victims are defenceless against attackers like Lieutenant Iván Moriano .
The real problem lies in the signing of preferential agreements with third countries by the European Union .
The essential elements are those that will enable the European Union to be more democratic , those that will enable the European Union to be more efficient , those , in short , that will enable the European Union to provide added value for citizens .
Without procedures , without legal bases , the European Union cannot act , and without more democracy , it will be acting without legitimacy .
Today , thinking of those friends and re-stating stating my commitment to them , I would like to thank the honourable Members for their understanding , enshrined in the text approved in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and which we will improve tomorrow by means of certain amendments .
What has happened off the Galician coasts with this peculiar oil tanker , originating from a tax haven , with a flag of convenience and furthermore , in unfair competition and trading oil in a very strange way , cannot and must not happen again in any of the seas of the planet .
A European research area should certainly include :
What should we do ?
We must increase our efforts to contribute to the search for peace in the Middle East , and to eliminate the points of tension in the Maghreb and , of course , provide humanitarian aid during the conflict and then assist in the human , political and economic reconstruction of the country afterwards , as the Presidency of the Union has pointed out .
The aim of the rapporteur &apos; s Amendment No 20 is to increase security .
We have held them with Brazil since 2007 , and the Salafranca report rightly calls for them in relation to Mexico , in view of the Council &apos; s somewhat ambiguous conclusions of October 2008 .
The reasons we have found ourselves in this situation , a situation the Chairman of my group has been warning of since June , are to do with the fact that we have not been able to impose the limit for institutional responsibility on those groups who thought that the report &apos; s contents could influence the investiture of the new Commission and who , for this reason , have insisted that it be debated now .
Firstly , it is not proven that reducing working hours creates jobs .
We are not just introducing greater rationality but also greater safety , and that is the objective of this initiative .
Therefore , in light of the response he has given me , I would like to reformulate my question and ask two that are very specific .
Clearly , the creation of an area of freedom and security is everyone &apos; s joint task .
Cologne was not an arrival point but rather a departure point and I am sure that Helsinki will be a new , very important , stage in this process .
I will give you an example of how basic they are , which I hope will not be unpleasant . In one of these , it states that &quot; there are 30 inspectors in Spain &apos; .
In this case , I agreed with an amendment by Mr Davies - defeated in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy - that proposed authorising and evaluating the professional prescription of heroin to addicts so that they might escape the clutches of dealers .
I support the creation of a standard dispute settlement mechanism with Egypt , enabling inefficiencies and deadlocks to be resolved and concluding the draft agreement with that country .
Companies are the special objective of the information campaign at the moment .
Subject : Poland &apos; s entry into the euro zone
All this goes on for so many years that , in the majority of cases , when infringement proceedings reach the European Court of Justice we are acting &apos; at the point of death &apos; , and so the law , in irreversible situations concerning the environment , achieves nothing .
A problem related to the market should be dealt with using the appropriate tools . It is unwise to keep resorting to the second pillar to solve all our difficulties .
Nevertheless , Madam President , Commissioner , Mrs Fontaine , that is what we have achieved , thanks to the particular work of those people I have mentioned - especially you and your team , Commissioner . I see that Mr de Visee is looking at me with that calm manner of his , which has been so important on many occasions .
We want to see the disappearance of starvation wages , which are unfair on immigrants and , what is more , distort average wages , particularly in sectors such as construction , agriculture , domestic services and the hotel industry .
What was uppermost in your minds , Commissioners ?
On the basis of the Commission &apos; s own diagnosis of the ineffectiveness of Community development policy , this report reaches different conclusions on how to remedy it .
Consequently , if there is no cooperation at national level it will not be possible to move towards that increased growth we all aspire to for Europe .
This opinion has tried to correct the Commission &apos; s approach , which ignores most of the essential elements , not only for control , but also for administration .
Mr President , Commissioner , I must first congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Esteve , on his wide-ranging ranging and detailed report , which covers each and every one of the concerns and uncertainties regarding Euro-Mediterranean Mediterranean cooperation .
Mr President , we should now be trying to defend Community preference or prevent the disappearance of the CAP .
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which , although geographically in Europe , are not members of the European Union .
The diagnosis given in these communications is also generally correct , rhetorical and grandiloquent .
Measures have economic and political costs and I would like to know from the Council and the Commission which of these costs they are prepared to meet .
I believe the time has come for a short process and a long peace .
In the end , our group abstained in the vote on this resolution due to the excessive emphasis placed on burning coal .
Firstly , I want to point to the need to take action to tackle the situation that often arises when the owner of a small or medium-sized sized enterprise retires .
Development and the environment - as our colleague points out in his report - cannot be opposing concepts but must be complementary .
In view of this situation , Commissioner , we support the Commission .
We ask for solidarity so that our people may be given a voice through the ballot box , as the Varela Project proposes .
Harmonisation of these waiting times is acceptable if it is due to a concern for the legal correctness of the procedure , but I fear that it may be inefficient and instil fear for both material and political reasons .
My question was whether the Council will support the continuation of the humanitarian aid to the population of Western Sahara throughout the process you described .
We need to remove the threat of indigenous coal mining coming to an end , and instead enable this strategic sector to survive in a reasonable manner . We also need to help the sector to achieve competitiveness within a reasonable period , without penalising the businesses later .
Mr President , I find myself in the same position as Mr Ephremidis .
That group should be the foundation for the future interinstitutional agreement on simplifying and improving the regulatory framework , to be adopted in December 2002 .
The four points I have referred to undoubtedly require the participation of the two parties , not only of the Palestinian Authority - which must participate - but also of Israel .
The final version should reflect the fact that I abstained on that report .
We have confidence in the Commission regarding this 2020 Strategy , which must also incorporate a discussion about the future of the Common Agricultural Policy , which is a fundamental policy in terms of environmental protection , food safety and the incomes of many European citizens .
Another example is the reference to a more active role in the sustainable development of the energy sector . A further example is the reference to strengthening the Bank &apos; s operations at municipal level .
In the unfortunate circumstance that someone is a victim of a crime in a State other than their usual State of residence , that citizen has to suffer the bad experience of an unacceptable lack of protection , which is due to the inability of the States to build a genuine European judicial area .
We can therefore accept this amendment in principle but with this modification .
There are others too .
Emissions are currently not disclosed , and what is even worse is that there is no common standard for measuring them .
The Finance Minister has brought this about .
Economic change and political change , and change in the government of the Union .
What should not happen is what we witnessed in the House this afternoon , when certain party leaders or leaders of political groups took advantage of the situation to attack other political groups for purely electoral reasons .
However , I must express my concern - and I ask that the Presidency communicate this to the Prague authorities - at the fact that two young Spaniards , Gaizka Azcona Cueva , 22 years old , and Mikel Oliva Martínez , 21 years old , have been detained arbitrarily since last Tuesday - nearly ten days .
According to the ECOFIN Directorate-General General &quot; s econometric simulations model , if the price of a barrel of oil stays at 50 dollars - and today I believe a barrel of Brent stands at over 51 dollars - the effect would be an accumulated growth loss over three years of almost one point of gross domestic product , if the price of a barrel remains at 50 dollars throughout that period .
However , Madam President , it is important that the European Union does not commit a series of errors .
There is no precedent for this concept in any report or any declaration either by this Parliament or by the national parliaments .
Measures cannot be taken without reviewing the situation of seafarers and considering exploitation and we cannot make one hundred percent progress on safety if we do not establish the situation of seafarers and their welfare in the report .
It is true that the timescales seem eternal , but I share the rapporteur &apos; s optimism that , in practice , the change will take place more quickly .
Firstly , it is recommended that specific Community economic compensation be granted for the socio-economic economic progress of Almadén and its surrounding area .
Finally , cooperation with countries of origin and transit in a spirit of partnership and co-responsibility responsibility , as agreed at the aforementioned forum , on the control of migratory flows , the fight against illegal immigration , the adoption of national readmission agreements and integrated management of the Union &apos; s borders .
It is incumbent on the public bodies , including European ones , to complete an appropriate regulatory framework at national and Community level as a matter of urgency . At the same time , the opportunity for a more ambitious political and financial support must be created .
I say in my report that both questions must be answered in light of the principles which governed the adoption of the Directive : the health and safety of workers .
But we want to make a decisive contribution to ensuring that the Intergovernmental Conference is as great a success as the Berlin Declaration , at least .
Furthermore , the Commission is prepared to consider a review of the interinstitutional agreement on the processing of petitions which would amend the one currently in force , from 1989 , with Parliament and the Council , especially with regard to something that seems to me to be essential , which has been pointed out by some of the speakers , that is , the problem of the periods prescribed for reply .
I share all your analyses : those of Mr De Rossa , those of Mr Cercas , those of Mrs Berès , all of you ; of course I share them .
We must stress once again that these are two completely separate issues : linking them in this way shows a huge lack of responsibility in relation to the numerous victims who have to cope every day with the consequences of our irresponsible arms exports policy .
Mr President , I want the European Protection Order to be particularly effective in preventing violence against women and to serve as a helpful prelude to the proposal that the Commission is preparing in order for us to have a similar instrument for all types of crime .
It is the justice system that must take the relevant decision and we all hope that that decision will indeed be just .
In the agreements with the northern countries they are completely under-exploited exploited and there is no way that the fleets with the greatest interest in fishing there can do so .
When it comes to ideas , I do not feel their hue is of much consequence .
Neither these instruments nor these policies can exist by themselves ; they are all linked together .
Mr President , I believe that what we have voted on , and regrettably has been rejected , is the paragraph amended by Mrs Prets ; it is not the amendment , but the paragraph as amended .
This matter is of important economic and social value .
Let me give one example : information supplied by the Staff DG and its equal opportunities unit , covering all European institutions .
I have to tell you , first of all , that in this case the European Parliament only has the competence to present a report .
I believe that this article should be promoted to the category of a fundamental right in terms of the free movement of services and persons . However , there are still many obstacles to the mobility of the workforce , qualified or non-qualified qualified , between the Member States , which prevents us from having European labour markets open to all and , probably , as a logical consequence of this , causes territorial imbalances and situations of injustice , social exclusion or poverty .
The President , as Mr Poettering well knows , since he was with me in the seminar that he invited us to , insists that we should hold comprehensible debates .
What kind of legally binding content does it have ?
I would simply like to tell you that there is a continent that is prepared to buy and sell , that is prepared to live in harmony with democratic beliefs , with the defence of human rights and environmental protection .
Hundreds of dubious single-hulled hulled vessels sail these seas .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Madam President , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) is going to vote enthusiastically in favour of this report , and I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs , the Commission and the Council on this agreement .
I would like to thank Mr Kindermann very much for having accepted my amendment , relating to the fundamental role played by forests as regulators of the water cycle , but I would still like to see an express mention of the importance of Community intervention in contributing to the maintenance and remuneration , where necessary , of the environmental services that forests provide for the whole of society .
Mr President , we are developing a third pillar on the basis of policies which have been intergovernmental and which must become Community policies .
This report puts forward measures which we support .
I am convinced that the Commission is right to create an independent evaluation unit within DGIA , since , if it ensures its independence and endows it with sufficient resources , this will be not only a constructive innovation but the best possible tool for improving the programme .
In view of the indiscriminate nature of cluster bombs and the enormous impact they have on the civilian population , the use of those weapons must no longer be tolerated in any way .
Failure to do so would amount to opening the floodgates to students whose sole intention was to come to work . There would be little incentive to make good progress on the courses of study .
Lastly , a cost and risk assessment of the new physical effects generated by these monsters of the seas needs to be carried out . These effects include , for example , the so-called called &apos; parametric resonance effect &apos; , which can cause containers to drop from the rear of the ship at a faster rate .
There must be a sufficient number of young people taking part in a project with these features , working on public utility actions but not charity work or amounting to social dumping .
It has emerged from the debate that some of you feel our main concern is to prevent public sector involvement .
All the elements are therefore in place at the moment , but that will be very unlikely to happen again at a later date .
For example , very little research has been done on the relationship between agriculture and climate change .
on behalf of the PPE-DE DE Group . - Madam President , I really do not think that the document that we are considering is what it could be , and I will explain : it is a document to assess what has been done with the broad guidelines that the European Commission had proposed for the environment , and for all environmental policy .
Our objective had to be - and still has to be - to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction .
We are therefore concerned about the fact that the Commission &quot; s Communication , to which Mrs Martens &quot; report refers , does not make more reference to the African Union and to the strategic plan that the Heads of State in that sister institution have defined as strategic priorities for the development of their continent .
We need to organize campaigns against it . But it is about time our plans of action were objectively , consistently and properly aimed at making progress in this battle which , supposedly , worries us all .
I do not think this is the right time to detail the harm done by undeclared work to the public funds and those carrying it out , due to their own position of insecurity , and to other employers , competitors or otherwise , and society in general .
We shall vote in favour with some amendments because something is better than nothing .
Whatever the case , arms exports exist and it is therefore useful and it is a step forward to have a code of conduct on arms exports , which sometimes run counter to the principles that should be the identifying features of the European Union : conflict prevention and the defence of human rights .
And it is precisely Latin America , with its growing organisational process , that offers more possibilities and at the same time has international repercussions that we should view positively .
Ladies and gentlemen , I have just come back from South Africa where I went in my capacity as a member of the EP delegation .
Mr President , European civil society has already shown how sensitive it is to the tragedy suffered by the peoples of Central America .
The European Union &apos; s commercial relations and policy on markets must combine the respect for the principle of Community preference with a reduction in tariffs together with the establishment of a list of sensitive products , giving the processing industry access to the supply of raw materials .
This is a fundamental issue within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy , since , if our objective is to be a dynamic and competitive knowledge-based based economy , research , technological development and innovation are undoubtedly the main tools for promoting growth , employment and competitiveness .
We Cubans are simple folk and we simply wish to live in peace and to move forward with our work , but we are not able and we do not wish to live without freedom .
Neither do I have any intention of criticising the rapporteur , who has produced a report of high quality and has also done so with flexibility and tolerance , accepting the positions of various political groups .
I will not analyse the specific issues , because I think those who have spoken before me have done so very accurately .
Why are we not growing ?
If we achieve energy interconnections in the South , East and North of Europe , if we put it forward as a major priority , giving authority to the Commission , we will see our energy dependency reduce , and we will encourage the development of renewable energy sources which , by their nature , require versatility in energy distribution .
I am calling on you , Mr President , on behalf of Parliament , to send your condolences to Mr Zapata &apos; s family , which is being harassed at his funeral .
- Before the vote on paragraph 72 :
Although the technologies of this information society are creating new products and new services , they will produce substantial social changes , but in the medium and perhaps in the short term , new job opportunities might appear and we must be able to seize them .
There can be no greater contradiction .
Budgetary surveillance will also need to take into account that the candidate countries are undergoing tremendous structural and institutional changes .
In response to today &apos; s crises , the national dimension and intergovernmental decisions are not sufficient , nor are simple solutions , even if they are based on statistical models .
Mr President , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , we may well agree on the importance of the Barcelona Council , but there is obvious disagreement regarding the assessment of its outcome . The large and peaceful demonstrations calling for a more social Europe are abundant proof of that .
Mr President , throughout their various interventions , MEPs have concentrated on two quite different points : in the first place , the problem of climate change and , in the second place , what the Commission or the European Union can do in a situation like the present one , with the extremely serious floods that have occurred .
Initially , she presented a draft report which seemed to me to be perfectly balanced and which I believe should have served as a basis , with the contribution of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries and with the spirit of Mrs Miguélez , for supplementing what she presented to us .
How can this House ask me whether or not I am aware of problems of civil liberties ?
We have seen extraordinary decisions at the same time : the communication from the Commission , the extraordinary decisions of the Council of Ministers last week and , of course , the 2020 strategy .
In English , this must say as follows , from the last line :
Finally , albeit late in the day , we have realised that we are all in the same boat and there is no point dealing with individual situations , especially in an improvised way .
Calls on the Council to do its utmost to implement the mandate from the European Council of 21 September and 19 October to unanimously adopt this proposal .
Parliament has translated this ambition into a pilot project on social tourism which the Commission will develop this year .
For all the above reasons , it is necessary to enter a phase of progressive closure and dismantling of nuclear plants , starting with those that have already had serious accidents , such as the Vandellós II plant in Catalonia and those that are nearing the end of their useful life . At the same time , we must increase energy efficiency , responsible energy consumption and investment in renewal energy sources .
We have been working against the clock and we have been dealing with an excellent and supportive fellow Member , who has been very open to accepting all the points our committee wanted to raise in this important debate .
We must work on the basis that peace must be given a chance , but we must not be hasty and of course we must not create situations which may be entirely counter-productive productive .
Were the Socialist Group &apos; s amendments to be included , it would indeed be almost perfect .
the report by Marie-Thérèse Thérèse Sanchez-Schmid Schmid , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development , on Objective 3 : a challenge for territorial cooperation - the future agenda for cross-border border , transnational and interregional cooperation ;
In summary , we believe that the Nordic dimension has been very beneficial to the interests of the European Union and therefore today we are debating the draft budget for 2003 in a situation which those of us with long budgetary experience could describe as exceptionally calm .
I supported this report because of the need to promote a framework for the improvement of education and training systems in Europe .
What happened yesterday reminds us that we do not need monsters : we humans are monsters when we lose our minds .
Complementarity is currently expressed in operational coordination on the ground and in the commitology procedure in Brussels .
Despite having similar laws , they have clearly never had a problem of this scale .
I would like to highlight that , despite its importance and the fact that it is a mandatory point of reference in Europe , the Convention has still not been ratified , as of 18 September 2000 , by the following Member States of the European Union : Austria , Belgium , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Portugal and Spain .
This debate relates to their role in the future , to organisation , structures , transparency , economic aspects , competence , governance and infrastructures .
This agreement should currently have top priority in the Union &apos; s foreign policy . We must not forget the history of Latin America nor the links established over the centuries between the various European countries who discovered what was then known as the &apos; New World &apos; .
Mr President , I would like to start by acknowledging the work done by the Swedish Presidency of the Council and the Commission to drive forward the multi-annual annual programme for the next five years in the area of freedom , security and justice .
I do not wish to recall the climate of the discussion we have held this morning in Parliament , but I would like to ask you to be very attentive , to take into consideration and not forget the decisions and priorities established by this Parliament as an arm of the Budgetary Authority .
It is clear - and the rapporteur knows this because we have talked about it many times and she agrees with it - that an immediate prohibition of the marketing of products tested on animals , which the application - which is already in force , I would remind you - of this sixth modification of the Directive would represent , would at this time involve difficulties in terms of compliance which are practically impossible to overcome .
On the contrary , it demonstrates the autocratic and authoritarian drift of a regime that , alongside seemingly democratic elections , closes opposing media , orders confiscations and arrests political opponents , showing no respect for human rights and the rule of law .
This civilian president has now been deposed by other military chiefs who snatched power along with the gold and diamonds that are the country &apos; s principal riches .
Secondly , because it contributes an element of added value to the Member States &apos; interventions , which will help to optimise the resources destined for development aid and to achieve better results .
If that does not happen , there is a risk that this very significant agreement will not be worth the paper it is written on .
The Commissioner has heard what previous speakers have said , for example Mr Baggioni , Mr Viola and Mr Karamanou , and I should simply like to take this opportunity to point out to him that there are two possible approaches to the problems bound up with island status .
We are not claiming that these programmes will completely solve the problem , but we do want to ensure that all the entities involved , be they health sectors , regions , or states , are working to guarantee consistency and complementarity in all their policies .
The problem has been its maintenance for almost forty years , during which conditions had changed radically .
It is clear that one problem we will have to face is the coherent decision taken by the Commission yesterday to bring proceedings before the Court of Justice as a result of the decision taken by the Ecofin Council .
This could now be the moment of truth , and we are reminded of that by the changes that are currently taking place in the Mediterranean .
The European Union must be progressive .
It is also worth noting that the Quartet , as mentioned earlier , met on the fringes of the Summit , and that the United States felt it was a landmark meeting . The value of concerted international action in achieving a negotiated solution to this particular conflict was therefore recognised .
This third main objective is to ensure and reinforce coexistence in a very particular manner , bearing in mind that we live in a continent which , in the last 20 or 30 years , has seen increased demographic changes in many countries .
We need regular meetings between officials responsible for external affairs and security .
Mr President , I should like to say , first of all , that we are discussing two quite different initiatives here .
The euro has been a great success , in terms of its introduction , in terms of issuing it as a currency , in terms of the consolidation of an excellent economic situation in Europe and in terms of the forecasts for the future .
However , what does interest me , with a view to the future , is to point out that this second report is , in our opinion , a positive contribution to the reform process which the next Commission will have to undergo under the Presidency of Professor Prodi .
In this respect , as proposed by the new regulation , in order to enhance trust in European Statistics , the statistical authorities must enjoy professional independence and ensure impartiality and high quality in the production of European Statistics , in accordance with the principles laid down in the European Statistics Code of Practice endorsed by the Commission in its Recommendation on the independence , integrity and accountability of national and Community statistical authorities .
Are you going to get them from the Structural Funds ?
the oral question to the Commission by Marco Pannella , on behalf of the ALDE Group , on Democracy , human rights and the new EU-Vietnam Vietnam Partnership and Cooperation Agreement - B6-0474 0474 / 2008 ) .
Time planning and compliance with the timetable laid down are crucial to the commercial viability and success of the programme .
Also , one of the paragraphs in Mrs Miranda de Lage &apos; s report clearly specifies that this agreement opens the way for cooperation in relation to financial aid for social programmes , programmes for the indigenous communities and programmes in favour of human rights .
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts , such as the Mediterranean countries , and countries with northern levels of rainfall .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would briefly like to say that if we want to provide citizens with good and efficient management of the Union &apos; s resources , it would seem sensible to take advantage of the experience we have gained over the years with the financial framework in force .
These countries have to protect the health of their inhabitants , the health of their citizens , but they lack the means to do so .
( Protests from the PSE Group ) Mr President , we must use these six months to make the European Union stronger in the world , participating in international debates by means of the common position .
In conclusion , Madam President , two final comments regarding fundamental matters of external policy .
If the Colombian Government , if a large number of people dedicated to achieving the pacification of the country in the country itself ( writers , intellectuals , etc . ) have failed to achieve those results , it is unlikely that we will be able to achieve them , but I believe - I am availing myself of the presence of the Commissioner , who deals with a very sensitive area concerning this issue , to say this - that we should continue our efforts .
What is basically happening in Heading 4 is that we are once again faced with having to fund Iraq .
I am referring , for example , to the art biennale , the book fair , the ballet festival or the trade fair in Havana .
Secondly , the change of Interior Minister , in other words , the Minister responsible for security .
Yet this effort has also led the Court to criticise the accounting system .
The Parliaments , and this House especially , are ready to take our inspiration onto the stage , as we say in Spanish , meaning to match words with actions .
On that occasion , however , the plenary of the European Parliament also tabled other amendments that were not included by the Council in Regulation ( EEC ) 881 / 2002 , or by the Commission in its current proposal .
Furthermore , I should like to draw attention to the importance of having global and coherent policies in the social , youth and education fields , aimed at preventing organized crime .
Nevertheless , you introduced a second element in your supplementary question which , in my opinion , is of great interest : Why do we not establish the objective of full employment in the same way that we established the objectives of the Treaty of Maastricht at the time ?
Ladies and gentlemen , everything I have mentioned here is added value .
We have no idea .
This question reflects the true feelings in that area which is undoubtedly one of scepticism , of terrible doubt , among those who ought to be the beneficiaries - in other words , the ordinary people - because in reality that regional development has not actually reached them .
The need for the European Commission to be directly involved in the efforts to enhance South-South South trade .
It really worries me , Commissioner , that a Commissioner said that on behalf of the European Commission .
Nobody questions the Commission &apos; s duty to pursue alleged infringements of Community Law .
As yet , it has not been necessary to use this instrument for coordinating economic policies ; so far budgetary compliance has been working as laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact .
Madam President , I have to recognize one virtue on Mr Rocard &apos; s part , which is that , faced with all the statements of good intentions as regards the social disaster of unemployment in the European Union , he has at least managed to submit to Parliament a detailed and specific report which has given rise to a long and intense debate .
Making progress on these four guidelines was the inspiration behind the Spanish programme of objectives and priorities for the Presidency of the Council of the Union .
Data exchange has therefore delivered positive results .
We must ensure that we adapt our rules to the reality of civil society .
Mr President , one can only express a deep sense of sorrow for the 23 fatalities : 22 in Germany and one in Sweden .
I believe that there is a proposal made by the Commission .
From that point of view , Mr President , I would like to call on everybody to bear this in mind , and not to abandon that vigilant position , and we should make it very clear that this European institution must also put aside sectarian or party political behaviour and think of the common project we have before us .
We must not forget the important role Russia can play in this process .
This , in my opinion , is an urgent issue for the future .
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions .
We therefore think that there are sufficient aspects left to warrant a new proposal and that , if it makes the requisite effort , the Council can find a way out .
Secondly , President-in in-Office Office of the Council , you have not mentioned the euro .
We do agree with the amendments that move in the direction of including biohydrogen in the scope of this directive .
We do believe in it .
In fact , the Member States recognised the limitations of Nice , convening a further IGC for themselves in order to revise the Treaty of Nice in 2004 , with specific objectives that will have to be finally fixed in the meeting in Laeken , under the Belgian Presidency , at the end of this year .
Secondly , and this is a key point , there is only one way of making progress on the re-establishment establishment of the rule of law after a coup d &apos; état and that is to hand the power that was usurped back to whomever is constitutionally , democratically and legitimately entitled to it .
Member of the Commission .
Firstly , nationality still falls within the competence of the Member States ; there is still a political entity in Europe which is called the &apos; State &quot; .
It is not acceptable from the point of view not just of transparency , but of democratic responsibility .
So the Socialist Group joins previous speakers in supporting the report from the Committee on Agriculture , and opposes any increase in the quotas and any other change which could endanger the current system for regulating the banana sector .
We must ensure that awareness of Europe , of what it means to be European , reaches everybody , and that sooner or later , everybody feels the need to ask what the European Union can do for each of them .
And what is worse , this decision comes at a very bad time , precisely on the eve of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference which is going to discuss the European Constitution .
If the agenda for the forthcoming reform remains restricted to Declaration 23 annexed to the Treaty of Nice , we will not be getting off to the right start , and the report that this House will , probably , approve tomorrow , calls for more than this .
Ladies and gentlemen , I will now refer to specific amendments .
Mr President , I would like once again to congratulate Mr Langen on his contribution to the continuation and consolidation of the ALTENER programme , since we must remember that this programme is our main instrument , although not from a financial point of view , in the carrying out of the European Union &apos; s strategy on renewable energy .
Accelerated globalisation is creating changes in financial products and markets that bring new challenges .
Despite considerable progress in terms of the situation of women , there are still considerable differences , especially discrimination at work and different wages for the same job .
We must make the conservation of fish compatible with the conservation of fishermen , and at difficult times , such as Galicia is going through at the moment , and may go through in future , we must not increase the fishing effort , particularly not in Community waters ; it is possible to cooperate with the development of third States while maintaining our employment and supplying our markets .
Is that the responsibility of the Council ?
With regard to the criteria for selecting priorities for the deployment of ships by region , as a result of the amendments presented and the agreements reached with the Council , the Agency will have to pay particular attention to regions that have been declared the most vulnerable , due to their greater susceptibility to accidents or deliberate pollution , given their characteristics and previous experiences . The Agency will , however , be able to assist in any other region within Community waters which needs help and which requests it .
Mrs Lindh , I believe that I do not need to speak at length , since the President of our Group , Mr Poettering , has made a clear , apposite and brilliant speech in which he has spoken loud and clear .
Indeed , Mr President , in the great haste which seems to hold sway over us , the competent committee for the fund has been decided on even before we know what it contains .
As regards European citizenship , I would like to highlight the final proposal in the report that calls for the Treaty to bring all the rights conferred on citizens within the ambit of a specific title .
The figure for 2001 was 16 % . This situation should be prevented by improving the assessment of budgetary needs and the evaluation of running policies in order to optimise value for money for the European taxpayer .
In this way , we are all quite clear that a situation whereby patients come in from other Member States , must not lead to any discrimination against citizens of the Member States where treatment is taking place .
Our Union is a community of values governed by law and the Member States are obliged to abide by the solidarity and mutual commitments laid down in the Treaties and which lie behind the CFSP .
We are here today for the 58 victims of Dover .
This could provide us with a margin for flexibility in order to more efficiently adapt political priorities to the available resources .
With regard to the first point , that of recent events , I would like to go back , Mr President , to the last meeting of the Quartet in New York on 22 September .
The distribution of automobiles has always had special treatment , a sectoral treatment , and , if pushed , I would say that this system may have made sense before , when there were different regulations for the different distribution systems , but perhaps it makes less sense now .
The debate does not adequately address the issue and does not bear in mind the fact that we must not only build an internal market but that , above all , we must achieve economic and social cohesion .
We are also in agreement with the ten summary points highlighted by yourself at the closure of the Interparliamentary Conference on fraud .
That is why we have introduced certain amendments into this motion for resolution , some paragraphs of which extend its scope somewhat so that it does not just effect Portugal , but also , in part , the whole of the Iberian Peninsula .
Of course , the Commission , by means of the Agency and the reports we will present here , will specifically monitor true compliance by the Member States with the issues agreed .
We therefore feel frustration , emotion and sadness as a result of the events of recent days .
It is incompatible with the goal of the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council for the Union to be a prominent global player with an inflation increase of barely 2.9 % .
Respect for the rights and dignity of women must be a firm and urgent requirement .
I would like to finish by congratulating Mr Vatanen on his excellent work .
I would like to draw Mr Howitt &apos; s attention to point 13 of the Barcelona European Council conclusions , which does not specifically mention the lifting of development assistance conditions .
Firstly , because for the first time we have the euro , our single currency , which is a guarantee of stability and which has been a great success .
Although the concept is in the progress of being developed , some advocate the use of the term &apos; feminicide &apos; in order to contrast it with the term &apos; homicide &apos; ...
Mr President , I should like to table an oral amendment to Recital A very briefly - . The amendment involves entering the relevant amounts .
Mr President , the Presidency would like to repeat that it is prepared to support the strategic priorities proposed by the Commission and to look in detail at their budgetary implications at the appropriate time .
Throughout this time , the Group of the Europe People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has maintained an attitude that has , more than anything , sought to encourage constructive work and a spirit of dialogue with all of the interested parties , with the aim of achieving better applicability of the provisions of the directive and , as a consequence of this , increased effectiveness of workers &apos; protection methods .
Therefore , I agree with what is said in the Commission communication regarding final appropriations totalling ECU 40 828 million , which coincides with the agricultural guideline for 1996 , which is the year we are discussing .
However , Mr President , this is a sector in which we are talking about more than 2 million companies , many of which are , of course , small and medium-sized sized enterprises , providing almost 10 million jobs ; a sector that is extremely labour-intensive intensive and in which human resources , and the quality of these resources , are fundamental aspects ; a sector that accounts for 5 % of the European Union &apos; s gross domestic product .
I also said in my first intervention that the Council is deeply concerned about the activities of the paramilitaries and is putting all the necessary pressure on the Colombian Government so that there is no cooperation of any type on the part of Colombian armed forces with these groups and in order to prevent the general belief that the paramilitaries are in some way acting in connivance with the government , which is not true at all , at least not with the government of Mr Pastrana .
I truly believe that if we were to hire an external auditor , they would be amazed to see what a good diagnosis we have , and what good remedies and solutions we have , but that , in spite of that , there has been such a complete lack of action in their application .
I therefore feel that the European Union &apos; s action must be directed at ensuring long-term term democratic stability in developing countries through the efficient funding of the corresponding programmes , in which the Commission has a crucial role to play .
I am at your disposal to clarify any point concerning this issue and , of course , it is untrue to say that Mr Barón lied .
We will therefore be able to feel proud of Europe &apos; s contribution to this progress in the international community , but we will by no means be able to rest on our laurels , for this will be the moment at which we have to move on to the next stage in this struggle for justice , in which Europe will again have an indispensable role to play .
As you are probably aware , as is typically the case in the European Union , temporary headquarters normally end up being the permanent headquarters .
Today we have the opportunity to ask for clear accounts in the Union and the proper use by Community institutions of the resources granted to them .
Therefore , Spain , and , by extension , the European Union , has an obligation not to hold back on this issue , especially as the UN Human Rights Council has once again called for the conflict to be resolved through a fair and lasting solution that is in accordance with international law , and we all know that , above all , this means that the right to self-determination determination should be applied .
This aspect is absolutely fundamental , not only in presentation , but also as a display of solidarity .
Mr President , to be honest , as a colleague pointed out before , the thought of discussing a resolution every September that simply reiterates that tens of thousands of hectares have been devastated in some Mediterranean countries fills me with sadness and even feelings of collective responsibility .
And despite my difference of opinion about time-limits limits , I think that at this time a minimum form of protection , like the one suggested in the compromise solution , should definitely not be ruled out .
At the same time , we are in direct agreement with the rulings of the Chilean legal authorities , who say that the actions of the political police during the dictatorship were true crimes against humanity .
The President of the bank has already made some reference to the efforts made .
The report on the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism - of which I am rapporteur - has therefore had to play a dual role .
Europe cannot compete with the very low wages and abysmal working conditions of the Third World .
The rapporteur , Manuel Medina , has explained in a rigorous and full way the legal arguments which explain how the Canaries has been defended for centuries , within a Spanish context , by means of different mechanisms which allowed those distant islands to overcome the negative circumstances which I spoke of earlier , and , with the skill , tenacity and efforts of their men and women , firstly resist and then gradually build reasonably modern and prosperous societies .
We have learnt a lot since the nineties : we can and we must communicate this experience to the authorities of the countries which will eventually join the euro zone and we can use these successive enlargements of the euro zone to explain to all of the European citizens , of the new and of the old member countries , the great advantages of the euro , and dispel some of the false ideas expressed about our single currency .
I would even ask for more , I would ask the Commission to consider reopening its office in Malabo .
Enlargement processes are also beneficial to the European Union , in terms of their political and economic consequences , because they promote and consolidate freedom and spread prosperity to our immediate neighbours through what has been called the transforming power of the Union .
And now , for the second time , Cuba &apos; s incorporation into the Cotonou Agreement is being rejected , at a time when international attention , Mr President , has been focused on the Iraq crisis and taking advantage of that situation there has been a wave of repression , unprecedented in recent years , which has resulted in three death penalties and a wave of arrests which have affected independent journalists , human rights campaigners and peaceful dissidents , many of them from the Christian Liberation Movement .
It is also necessary to do considerably more work to ensure that the process for selecting civil servants is more transparent and more based on merit .
We have stated that there were alternative crops to the drug traffic , which accounts for world movements of 500 , 000 million dollars .
Furthermore , as we know , it will not be possible this year to use the flexibility instrument in this chapter .
Though it is always useful to improve the processes for enlarging the euro zone and improve the European Parliament &apos; s involvement , my central message is addressed to our fellow citizens from Cyprus and Malta , so that they may hear our view that Cyprus and Malta can join the euro zone and must be able to enjoy all the advantages of the monetary union from the beginning of next year .
At times like this it is easier to look the other way , it is easier to hide behind a banner than to confront tyranny .
I voted against .
This is the commitment that we ask of Laeken : an ambitious reform with a different method of achieving more Europe and a better Europe .
It must be pointed out to the honourable Member that Mr Mas Canosa was also received by the former Prime Minister , Mr Gonzalez , and by the former Foreign Affairs Minister , Mr Solana , who is now Secretary General of NATO .
I will give you an example of what I believe we must not do and what I have unfortunately heard here .
In relation to the agreement with Russia , it is not a question of negotiating anything with regard to the export of material by the European Union .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are legislating in a field which is fundamental to the future of our interpersonal , economic and commercial relations .
Dialogue and politics serve to resolve these tensions . Timely recourse to dialogue and politics prevents conflicts , but by denying what is going on and attempting to overcome these conflicts without telling the truth we are on the surest path to ending up with regrets .
Please , do something about it .
Therefore , I think that Europe must take the initiative and give the Member States a clear directive .
I do not know why some of you are surprised by the words &apos; sanctions &apos; or &apos; requirements &apos; .
In order for it not to disappear , we need to go back to the traditional values of sport , in which people compete for one reward only - a medal .
In addition , there are several measures - I am referring particularly to the CARDS programme - that should go beyond reconstruction and extend to training , education and the reconstruction of civil society in close collaboration with NGOs .
With regard to the scope , I would like to focus on a very specific aspect : that of interoperability .
Its relations with Egypt and Jordan and even with Europe itself have never been worse , as we know .
Without allowing the cosmetics industry to delay eliminating its animal experimentation practices , the proposal for a directive allows exceptions for very specific tests and for a maximum period of ten years .
The most important factors for achieving these objectives are : creating a management , coordination and information operations centre ; identifying available resources in the Member States ; training programmes for intervention teams and for experts in the assessment of needs and the coordination of transport , resources and teams and establishing a joint emergency communications system linking all available civil protection teams .
However , despite the consent given today by Parliament , a resolution has also been adopted which , despite being the positive resolution adopted by this House in relation to Serbia , points out that Belgrade &apos; s cooperation with the International Criminal Court and a full commitment to democracy and the rule of law continue to be imperative in its journey towards the EU .
If it was not , the resolution should be debated immediately . The resolution agreed by all the parliamentary groups must be recovered and put to the vote .
Mr President , in general terms this House shares the concern expressed in Mrs Morgantini &apos; s question .
Mr President , my group and I firmly support the introduction of a tax on financial transactions for two reasons .
It strikes a balance in favour of the promotion of a competitive and responsible fishing industry which can survive in the market place .
Are you going to stop this ?
In any case , allow me one final joke , even though the Commissioner is no longer present . Many of us would like to say to the United States : look here , Article 19 of the United Nations Charter states that whoever does not pay will have no vote , and just for once , we could adopt the same attitude as they usually do and tell them that they have lost their right to vote .
The aim of both was to end the discrimination suffered by European companies in comparison with those of third countries , particularly American ones , in terms of the provision of services .
Old ships are still operating , using flags of convenience of countries which are less demanding in terms of safety , with crews which in most cases do not have the necessary professional qualifications and knowledge for this type of transport .
With regard to the demand for work , we must promote work-seeking seeking by the unemployed , by means of policies which make it absolutely clear that it is better from both an individual and a collective point of view to work than to be receiving benefit , both in terms of personal development and the financial situation of everybody , and also to promote schemes for extending the retirement age in all our countries .
Furthermore , we all want to hear what they have to say .
The first document cited is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 , which we should always use as a guide ; Article 2 of the EU-Egypt Egypt Euro-Mediterranean Mediterranean Association Agreement , which is still to be ratified , is also cited .
Within this context I would like to put three questions to Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner Waldner .
The Barcelona process is necessary in order to complete the process started in Lisbon and you have said , Mr President , that there is no better means of achieving social integration than creating employment .
Of course , the current problems cannot be attributed to the euro . As we all know , the causes of this very deep crisis do not lie here in Europe or in the euro area .
No-one one thought two or three weeks ago that it would be possible to conclude the draft Treaty in Amsterdam .
Nevertheless , I truly consider it to be unacceptable to interpret the differences in criteria with regard to the content of the proposal for a directive in terms of a supposed confrontation between the powerful interests of the tobacco lobbies and the common interest of protecting consumers .
The expert report , known as the Davignon report , found a way of formulating a European system of worker involvement .
The Vienna Initiative has meant that action could be coordinated , including maintaining the positions and risks taken by private banks in those countries . It has been possible to maintain a financial system at maximum level that helps to finance the consequences of the crisis and the investment needed to come out of the crisis .
One example of this is the large number of immigrants reaching the coast of eastern Spain , or more than 4 000 immigrants from Sri Lanka and Pakistan waiting to be taken to Europe from the beaches of Guinea Conakry .
I therefore ask the Commission to decide to put an end to the exemption from the rules of origin as soon as possible .
I would first like to highlight the importance of this draft resolution , approved by the Committee on Agriculture . It is the result of the efforts made by all the political groups to reach a consensus on the common agricultural policy , in which so many different interests are involved .
For example , section 4 of Amendment No 5 would make these assessments obligatory for all the plans for the sectors listed in the directive . The third section of Amendment No 10 would mean an unnecessary burden for the Member States .
And I would describe this procedure as insufficient , not because it is naïve to believe that it is easy to carry out , nor because it is puerile to ask the Commission and the Council to achieve objectives which are beyond their capabilities .
Mr President , the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but , in general terms , it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease .
Women cannot be worth half what men are in Arab counties or anywhere in the world .
We are also working to build up the ministries of trade and energy .
It is a question of reflecting , in relation to a text which is important in terms of the Convention , on something which is of great importance to this Parliament , which is the legitimacy , the double legitimacy , of the Union .
Lastly , I shall give a brief summary of the actions planned for the near future and which , as you shall see , fully address your concerns and your suggestions .
Mr President , it is abundantly clear that the European Union is currently experiencing the most serious institutional crisis of its history .
Therefore , within this passionate and extremely complex debate , I believe that this is an occasion when - and I hope this is demonstrated in the vote - we have been able to achieve unity in the House - in Parliament - so that we can express ourselves clearly .
I think that this is what Mrs Ghilardotti set out to achieve in her arduous and efficient work : I think that she was seeking this point of equilibrium , and , yes , it is difficult - I would say practically impossible - for some delegations , such as the Spanish , to vote for the content of Amendment No 12 , and for the rest , we have to underline the work she has undertaken and congratulate her on her effort .
I share the idea mentioned by the President and included in the report that the European Investment Bank is an instrument of European Union policies , but we must not forget either that the EIB has the obligation to make optimal use of the resources at its disposal .
In general terms , we openly condemn the persecution , imprisonment and frequent execution of those people who engage in the defence and promotion of human rights , those who defend sexual freedom and those who are campaigning against the death penalty . All these people are frequently charged in Iran with carrying out activities against national security .
We have seen this in the case of Mozambique and other disasters .
I believe we should all be worried .
At the moment , the majority of Member States prohibit this practice : Germany , Austria , France , Ireland , Greece and Spain , amongst others , and it is not an arbitrary prohibition .
Since the attempt to move these resolutions began , a chairman of a human rights committee has been assassinated in his doorway in front of his daughters , as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler Dörfler just mentioned .
Mr President , I should first like to express my support for what my colleague Mrs Grossetête has said , and then to indicate that I totally support the European Commission &apos; s proposal for the scope of this directive to be extended to include products derived from agriculture and stock breeding , in the hope of providing better consumer protection .
On this particular point , agreement has been reached on the exchange of information needed to prevent tax avoidance and to prevent economic and financial activities being hidden from the public authorities by utilising the protection of tax havens . It is therefore true that not everything has been solved in these six months .
Inflation is hiding the fact that , basically , we really only have an increase of 4.9 % .
We decided to call a trialogue meeting but , to our surprise , on the same day of the meeting , the Spanish Presidency unexpectedly announced to us that , at the request of the French Government , the Spanish Government had decided to postpone the issue as it was unsure about its legal basis .
That is not all , however , as Mr Corbett , Mrs Hautala and Mr Barón Crespo also seem to be telling us that the important thing for an institution is who gets there first , and to be saying that we need to move faster , that we are going very slowly . That is not the point of the issue , as you so rightly pointed out .
The Commission does not take account of the situation of countries such as Spain , whose production of sugar has always been in deficit .
I am very happy that Mr Gorostiaga is concerned about the right to freedom of speech and assembly and I hope that from now on he will also be concerned about the representatives of my party and the Socialist Party assassinated by a terrorist group supported by his political group , which thank God is now defunct .
Secondly , I believe that the Lamassoure report also puts forward a very solid position on one of the great issues in the Convention , the control of subsidiarity .
In any event , it must be said that , in the view of my group , the amendment proposed by the Commission does not solve the problems already raised in the sixth amendment , mainly those relating to the World Trade Organisation . It merely eliminates the provision on the ban on sales and marketing and extends the time limit for banning experiments .
We need to be serious in this regard and support this policy that has required such efforts to produce .
The fact is that the Commission adopted an unprecedented decision , introducing provisional tariffs for a period of five months by way of an antidumping measure .
Dolly the Sheep died ill and malformed .
You have addressed a number of aspects , such as transparency ; what I missed in your speech was a reference to recent agreements in the framework of the G20 , concerning the fight against tax havens and so-called called &apos; non-cooperative cooperative jurisdictions &apos; .
In order to find EUR 5 billion it has been necessary , as Reimer Böge said , to force a way through the budget procedures , to strain the interinstitutional agreement and for the three institutions to work for six months ; and all this , as has been said many times , in order to leave half the funding subject to the hazard of another conciliation procedure .
I can still remember how , at the beginning of this debate , which I experienced with Mr Simpson in a different capacity , we were presented with a text to harmonise the technical rules and administrative procedures for civil aviation , that is to say , to move on from the JAR-OPS OPS to the EU-OPS OPS , and we were surprised to find that it was a text with a black hole in it : it lacked the sub-section section Q , relating to restrictions on flight time and activity and to rest requirements .
On the subject of climate change , on 11 February the Council will carry out an analysis of the Copenhagen Summit , with the help of the Commission . Of course , the European Union should continue to take steps in favour of a strategy which will bring us to a progressive agreement to promote the reduction of climate change .
I am referring only to the problem seen in the Mediterranean and the specific harm which such fishing with driftnets causes for the fishermen , to be precise in the Balearic Islands , which suffer the damage occasioned by the presence of over 500 Italian vessels fishing with driftnets .
However , what negative effects are there due to third countries benefiting from this preferential treatment ?
In our future work - and here I agree with my fellow speakers - it is , therefore , we industrialised countries that will have to lead the way in this reduction of emissions .
I believe that the conclusion of a new protocol on fisheries relations between Senegal and the European Union - which is of particular importance following the failed agreement with Morocco - should be welcomed .
Just as protecting biodiversity is and must be a central value in our current societies , the protection of linguistic diversity must be seen as a central element of progress , the promotion of peace and development .
They are not asking Eurostat to resolve it .
Lisbon set the objective of a fully competitive society by 2010 , in which we would be able to overcome our technological and scientific backwardness in comparison with the United States , which was the term of reference established in Lisbon .
This has been acknowledged by the United Nations &apos; special envoy and the great majority of the international community .
Here we have to take the lead as Members of the European Union .
The European Union needs a new culture of immigration and a better management of migration flows .
What is more , the prison conditions of those sentenced , according to all the news , Mr Nielson , clearly violate human rights .
Ladies and gentlemen , I think our amendment on this point is just a sign of our misgivings , as Mr Fischbach so diplomatically said .
We in the Commission , therefore , will continue to support the committee &apos; s efforts , and I hope that we will feel as happy with the progress made in future as with the progress we are making now . We are making progress , and we are moving towards the scenario Mr Gemelli described : an increasingly complex , globalised world , in which the citizen does not diminish in stature , but rather grows in self-respect respect , in accomplishments and as a human being .
Mr President , the Salafranca report comes at an opportune moment .
Our answer to this crucial question is no .
Twenty years ago , fish was the cheapest dish on the menu .
I believe that this post responds to an objective need and to a great sensitivity amongst the European citizens , as the latest Eurobarometer indicates .
Mr President , we think it is vitally important for the European Parliament to support the outcome of the agreement in the Conciliation Committee aimed at bringing about a final approval after more than a year of tough negotiations of a set of guidelines relating to the trans-European European telecommunications networks .
Whether or not the Charter is incorporated into the Treaty clearly depends on the work which the convention is able to carry out .
Each and every one of us would sign up to his speech in full .
Although differences exist between Member States , it is surprising that , over time , the logistical resources for analysing and eliminating meat meal or risk-containing containing material have not been found .
I would , however , like to emphasise three statements that the Commission will make when it adopts the directive .
If you were also to add the cost of each of those votes to Parliament &apos; s budget , there would be even more cause for concern .
Commissioner , it is frankly no easy task to bring together the interests of consumers with those of producers , as well as respecting the European Union &apos; s international commitments to the ACP countries and the Lomé commitments signed in Cotonou , and also to combine efforts in favour of the outermost regions , while respecting the GATT rules for third countries and safeguarding diversity in European Union supply and production .
Significant technological progress has been made - the Internet over written media , cable , satellite television , digital technology - which have transformed the landscape .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to tell the House that we are preparing a framework directive on minimum efficiency requirements in the office communication equipment sector , amongst others , a directive which I hope will be presented to this House and the Council during next year .
As the Chairman of my party , Mariano Rajoy , proposed a few months ago in Paris , a specific obligatory subject should be created in all colleges and schools in the Member States , which would cover the origin , the objectives and the operation of the European Union &apos; s institutions .
At this time , therefore , I think it is important - and Mr Trichet is a good navigator - to keep a steady course and to maintain the model which has enabled us to come this far .
The Nice timetable expires at the end of 2002 .
Mr President , please allow me to clarify to this Parliament that the decision on the request to hold a meeting referred by Mr Iturgaiz earlier is currently in the hands of the Spanish justice system and it therefore falls to the public prosecutor and the judge to make the decision , in a country under the rule of law , such as Spain , in which the justice system is independent , and furthermore according to a procedure that has been debated and agreed in the Spanish Parliament ; it is therefore an entirely democratic decision .
Thirdly , I should like to state my personal opinion , if Mr Romano Prodi , who is both an Italian and a European citizen , decides to stand in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament , he should then resign .
It is obvious that the growing role of Brazil deserves not only respect , but real congratulations .
It is also the case that this year the new model established at the Lisbon Summit and the debate in the European Council on two questions which are fundamental to the drawing up of the broad economic guidelines have reduced the time available for the creation of this document , and this has also affected the European Parliament .
All of this happened following an important joint hearing in Parliament &quot; s Committee on Fisheries with the sector and the scientists involved , in 2001 .
Specifically , the right to intellectual property and also users &apos; rights to privacy are recognised by Article II-77 77 of the draft European constitution .
Coherence means that all sectoral policies - trade policy , agricultural policy , all external actions - must come together in one single policy ; a policy which is coherent with the global objectives we are pursuing .
I am glad that the members of the European Parliament &quot; s delegation are here in this debate .
Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , a young Czech , Rumanian or Hungarian can get skills training and benefit from the programmes .
We also welcomed the family of José Antonio Ortega Lara , a prison officer , whose kidnapping lasted more than 500 days .
Why 45 , 000 and not 90 , 000 or 35 , 000 ?
The Presidency and the Commissioner have referred to the next appointments we have , starting with the London meeting , and followed by Prague , when the European Union and the United States will begin a new relationship , following the election of President Obama .
The judgment of the San Francisco Court of Appeal confirms intellectual property rights and establishes certain measures for the protection of intellectual property in the United States .
Madam President , in its proposal for a reform the Commission has not followed most of the guidelines contained in the report approved in December by this Parliament .
However , both this Commissioner and the Commissioner responsible for trade , Mr Lamy , have made a huge effort to give substance to this Summit , which - we all agree - must not merely be a talking shop .
Madam President , Minister , Commissioner , European citizens cannot understand why , in the age of technology , telecommunications , satellites , etc . , we are experiencing incidents of piracy that appear to be transporting us back four or five centuries in our history .
We must insist on the maximum level of compensation funds in the event of pollution or in the proposals to promote with the countries of the Union modifications in the field of international maritime law , which is based on completely obsolete principles from the nineteenth century rather than the twenty-first first century .
For this reason I think that - in the spirit of the doctrine of the European Union in general and in the spirit previously adopted by this Parliament in the Newens report in particular , we should seek a formula which , within the framework of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , would allow us to progress in order to find an institutional formula in our relations with this country .
Regardless of the reasons that may have caused this mistake , it is certain that it is motivated by the constant initiatives , originating in the Commission , that are carried out with regard to legislation .
Well today , at the outset , we are returning to a star issue : the attempt to create the Single Sky ; the attempt to harmonise the technical standards ; an increase in safety ; an increase in the capacity of our airspace .
I would recommend an improvement in 2000 .
Mr President , I agree with what has been said about the problems we are experiencing at the moment with the organization of committees and plenary sessions . We have just this minute arrived from a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control , which is supposed to be dealing with this matter .
It is absolutely exemplary given that in such a short space of time we should have a country in peace and with a project for the future , one that is unstable , but a project nonetheless .
When the European Commission originally consulted civil society , all the actors - from the farmers to the ecological organisations - expressed their support for funding that initiative by means of a separate and single fund , since that would be the only way to oblige the European Union to make a funding effort .
I shall also do my best to ensure that the facts we have available at any given time are forwarded to the House .
I believe that that should be the basis for the European course of action .
With regard to the report by Mrs Martens , I would insist that the vote be postponed until the next mini part-session session in Brussels .
Our own history demonstrates this and what we have to do is support coordinated international action within the framework of the United Nations , taking advantage of the proposals of the Arab League so that Madrid may offer another glimmer of hope .
However , there is one question which I must put to him and that is why the Commission , which has lost the argument over the Banana Panel at the World Trade Organisation , has lost the argument with the Panel on Hormones , the only panel where it really had any chance of winning , has now sought a consensus-based based solution when it is still negotiating questions as important as the principle of laws &apos; extra-territoriality territoriality and the same World Trade Organisation body as an instrument to solve this type of conflict .
We cannot agree with the rapporteur &quot; s proposal with regard to the difference between animals intended for slaughter and animals intended to live .
There is no question of solving this as if it were a religious problem ; it concerns a State , regardless of its professed religion , against a colonised nation , regardless of its professed religion .
I would therefore like to thank you all .
Mr President , in the process of reorienting Europe &apos; s productive activity to meet the demands of the globalization of the world economy , research and technological development play a crucial role .
The ratification of the Treaty of Nice is a necessary condition in order to move forward , and I consider the Declaration on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice by Ireland to be important , confirming that this Member State &apos; s policy of neutrality will not be affected by that ratification .
The European Commission and the Member States committed themselves , on an international level , at the Ministerial Conferences on the protection of the forests in Helsinki , in 1993 , and Strasbourg , in 1990 , to the continuous monitoring of the damage suffered by the forests .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very happy to be here today to participate in the debate on the approval of the directive on port reception facilities for ship-generated generated waste and cargo residues .
I believe that , at this time , the essential thing , the priority , must be to deploy all the resources available to us to protect those sentenced and their families .
Europeans are consuming increasing quantities of organic products and we must establish an appropriate framework as soon as possible in order to meet those needs , protecting the interests not just of consumers but also , at the same time , the interests of the sector and environmental interests in general .
Mr President , last week this debate was dominated by some unfortunate news for cohesion .
The G20 has reaffirmed common priorities , made agreements to provide resources to the International Monetary Fund , development banks and for the promotion of trade . It has carried out reforms in global financial governance , implemented ambitious plans with regard to regulation and supervision , and has made progress in the fight against tax havens .
But in terms of rights - particularly individual rights - European legislation has been intended to be a model , and has sometimes succeeded in establishing a legal , and also a moral , point of reference .
This is being done with EAGGF Funds .
Commitments must be upheld , and therefore we will vote against all the amendments tabled , especially any amendments that do not respect the commitments already made , and here I am referring to the Socialist Group .
It is essential to our parliamentary work that Members of Parliament should feel secure when carrying out their work .
The Socialist Group of the European Parliament advocates the European Union &apos; s active participation in these conferences and it is therefore necessary for European Community development policy to be effective , coherent and cohesive .
One of the objectives of this Summit was to promote regional integration in the area .
But we always blame the Member States for this and say that they commit more than they are then able to spend .
I would like to say on behalf of my group that the repeated violations of human rights , non-compliance compliance with the latest United Nations resolutions on the part of the Israeli Government and , above all , Ariel Sharon &quot; s insistence on renewing executions outside the framework of international law , will leave us with no other option than to reiterate the positions adopted by this House in its Resolution of 10 April 2002 and to call on the Commission and the Council to strictly apply the second article of our Association Agreement .
The annex to the Commission &apos; s proposal includes the indicative targets with regard to the national level of consumption of green electricity necessary for achieving the total quota of 22.1 % for the whole of the European Union by 2010 , in accordance with the objectives laid down in the White Paper of 1997 .
I hope that the Spanish Government will act quickly and that we shall be able to implement these measures .
Only through a general derogation in favour of the outermost regions will companies located in those regions be on an equal footing with companies located on mainland Europe .
In the case of the Central American Parliament , this task is , if possible , even more important given the enormous challenge of the integration and structural development of these societies on the basis of peace , dialogue and reconciliation .
This event struck the very core of the men and women of Peru , who cannot believe it .
It is not a question of finding who is to blame , but on this occasion , major errors have occurred , starting with the foolhardy and reckless assumptions of a regional policy manager , recently recruited to the job , who unleashed social alarm and a very serious , irreparable economic crisis .
I am referring , of course , to the violence displayed by the demonstrators and to relations with the United States .
If there was a need for inspections , it was never so acute as during this period .
A number of district and central courts have been set up , and over twenty judges have been trained and appointed in Chechnya .
I am from Navarra , where liberalisation has already been implemented : planting rights are worthless , but while in Navarra a kilo of grapes sells at 15 cent , the same kilo of grapes is worth more than 1 euro barely 10 kilometres away in La Rioja .
Of the remaining 16 , some , and in particular Amendments Nos 5 and 6 , are no longer relevant following the interinstitutional agreement on the 2000 budget .
As the European Parliament pointed out last January , the European Union and its Member States provide more than half of the contributions to the United Nations system and to peace-keeping keeping missions .
There are calls for this to be the first area to be tackled . In fact , the reports on the condition of the economy in the various Member States are systematically taking account of this issue in analysing the situation .
On the issue of the European coastguards , I fully agree with the European Parliament &apos; s position , but also have to know where we are .
A few years later the Iron Curtain fell .
The greatest difficulty has been in reconciling the various interests : those of the companies , in order to allow them to be economically viable , those of the preservation of resources and social and economic measures which are able to defend an activity largely based in the least developed regions , outermost regions and Objective 1 regions .
We know that the role of the market is crucial to achieving these objectives , but we are still hesitant when it comes to implementing specific measures , above all when we give in to those short-sighted sighted sentiments that still perceive the Kyoto Protocol as an attack on competition and employment when it should be seen , because it can now be seen , that the opposite is the case .
50 000 tonnes of fuel oil in two wrecks which , unfortunately , are still leaking oil .
I do not think that it requires much imagination to know which group has been behind the scenes , applying pressure so that my question should not be given an oral reply in Parliament and so that this newspaper should already know Mr Prodi &apos; s precise reply .
The approach largely conforms to the guidelines expressed in the Alpine Convention and its Protocol on transport .
This is not discrimination in the sense that we have spoken about , but quite the opposite , since whereas vessel owners in certain fleets - as in this case - are paying increasingly more , in other kinds of agreement they benefit from fishing possibilities at no cost to themselves whatsoever - and here I am referring to agreements with Nordic countries in which southern fleets are not involved .
It continues : &quot; It is therefore necessary for the consumer to be clearly informed before signing the contract &quot; .
It is completely contradictory to have citizenship without rights .
So as not to repeat what has already been said , in particular what has been said by Mr Fiori , who I agree with , I will refer to another central point of the debate , i.e. the reform of the Commission .
This Parliament must follow the efforts the Romanian authorities must make very closely .
It is , in fact , the only major Western currency that has not made its users poorer .
Competition will automatically come about as soon as Europe becomes the reference area , rather than some specific country . This is not an ideological issue .
I particularly agree with the proposals made regarding fish-farming farming and squid , and I understand the concern you express , Mrs Bonino , to the Government of the Canary Islands in your letter of 27th December last , about responsibility for the biological &quot; desert &apos; in the territorial waters of Morocco .
The decision that was taken is well known .
If the possibility offered by these amendments existed , some Member States would use it when a project that is very important for the Union is of little national interest .
Ninthly , it requires policies of remembrance so that the victims are not forgotten .
I would like to remind you of the names of Joan Alsina , a Catalan priest who was killed by machine gun fire in Santiago de Chile under General Pinochet &apos; s dictatorship , and Joan Olidon , from Valencia , who disappeared during the early days of Pinochet &apos; s dictatorship .
The proposed judicialisation is not the best way to improve relations between the citizens and the European public Administration , and I would refer to the existing examples that have already been mentioned .
That is what I hope you will also understand , and it is what we all hope for in Parliament : for you to give explanations , either here or in a committee that we should reactivate in order to ascertain the real truth .
I joined the House on 19 April and I will leave on 19 July , with two months of interruption .
In the economic recovery plan approved by the Commission and endorsed by the Council , we propose that , between now and 2010 , an additional EUR 4 billion from unused Community budget resources be mobilised for trans-European European energy networks and related investments . That means EUR 4 billion out of the EUR 5 billion that in the communication , in our plan , we proposed should be used , will be allocated for these purposes .
There has been a failure in the management of risk , in governance and , finally , in ethics .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mrs Bauer , I am obliged first of all to talk about my profound disappointment with you for the way that you have carried out a negotiation in which Parliament was not respected and for the way that you are presenting this debate here today , which is very economical with the truth .
The two of you will have to work hard to push , drag and lead , at a moment in history that we had intended to tackle with the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon .
Some of the data we are currently using could be useful to Parliament .
We believe that , in a global sense , a Community system of labelling must be consistent with the existing guidelines of international bodies , that it must not lead to any kind of discrimination , nor create obstacles to trade , particularly that of the least-developed developed countries , and that it must act as a weapon for combating illegal fishing by denying it access to the markets .
Mr President , unfortunately , this is not the first time that we have discussed Equatorial Guinea in Parliament , to condemn the dictatorship that in practice the country is under , and also to regret the ineffectiveness of all the actions that we take .
I recommend to Mr Poettering that he reads the report carefully .
Having said this , it is an ambitious and difficult project , because , as you have mentioned , it requires a change to the Treaty and to the constitutions of at least four or six Member States .
We have come to an agreement and taken the view that the best solution is an oral amendment to Amendment 46 that I propose to the House and which consists of a simple addition , as follows : &apos; and in any case not later than 1 July 2008 &apos; .
With the discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and the vote , which was unanimous , on these two agreements - something which does not happen very often - and with today &quot; s debate in plenary and the subsequent vote , one stage is being closed and another opened up , marked , I would say , by the forthcoming Guadalajara Summit .
Perhaps it is worth mentioning some of the subjects .
I believe that the procedure for granting discharge for 1996 , which has not yet been granted by Parliament , is excellent proof of the importance of the Court of Auditors &apos; reports in this area .
It is heartening to see the Commission undertake to use the Solidarity Fund to help in the case of forest fires .
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .
In this respect , there is an issue that needs to be highlighted that forms part of my personal experience : terrorists - whatever their colour - cannot be given the chance to hold the key to a process .
In this way , the Commission would be acting coherently with itself , since it states , in the communication we are debating today , that it is aware that the European Union &apos; s relations with the developing countries must be based on solidarity .
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway , that he preferred to get things right , but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting .
As the honourable Members know , the Maritime Safety Agency is operational , with a provisional headquarters , but operational nonetheless , and one of its functions is to guarantee that , in all ports of the European Union , appropriate controls are carried out ; that the classification societies carry out their appropriate control obligations .
I would say that floundering is something of an understatement .
I am proud that the Lisbon Treaty incorporates the essential elements of the Constitution that we drew up , which was endorsed by the majority of countries at the time , but as the co-rapporteur rapporteur Mr Méndez de Vigo said , I would also like to say that this is not the end of the road , it is not the end of the story .
And , what is more , if crisis management is inadequate , the problem uncontrollably spreads and worsens .
A transitional period will be needed so that equipment can be replaced and procedures can be improved and adapted . Differences relating to technological development and type of activity , such as agriculture , will have to be taken into account , with a conviction that &apos; no-risk risk &apos; does not exist and that the quest for safety is the responsibility of all those involved : workers , be they self-employed employed or employed , employers or local , regional or national administrations .
Therefore , the road before us is not easy .
Madam President , I believe that the adaptation of Bulgarian and Romanian legislation to European rules represents progress , because , when it comes to adoptions , the most important thing is the protection of the child .
That safety must be dealt with in a global manner and it is not sufficient to talk about guarantees and safety for air companies from our territories , that is , European air companies and aircraft , because third-country country aircraft also use our airports and huge numbers of our citizens travel on them .
It is a matter of replacing the words &apos; points out that the minimum requirement for EU cooperation with third countries must be compliance with international obligations &apos; with &apos; points out that EU cooperation with third countries must be based on international obligations &apos; .
Ecofin &quot; s proposals destroy the balance achieved in the Convention , and the European Parliament , knowing this , accepted a formalisation of the financial perspectives in the Constitution , restricting its own budgetary powers , because its power to reject the multiannual framework and to be able to decide against the Council &apos; s position by a very high majority of its Members , in the event of a disagreement in relation to the annual budgetary procedure , was recognised .
From a European perspective , for the first time since the Madrid conference , the European flag has been on the table in the peace process .
I also believe that it is crucial that it has been designed as an instrument for providing public information . In this regard , we hope that INSPIRE complements public sector information and the directives on access to environmental information adopted in application of the Aarhus Convention , which we approved recently , and that it deal with a series of issues not provided for in those directives , such as the sharing of data amongst public authorities and issues of interoperability .
On the one hand , the discharge of the accounts is submitted to this plenum and , secondly , what is proposed is that the management should be discharged , rather than postponed , accompanied by recommendations which make up a resolution covering very diverse aspects , some of which I will comment on very briefly .
The mechanisms for following up the Conference were also the subject of intense debate , with the decision finally going to various methods of follow-up up , at the spring meeting of the Economic and Social Council , with the Bretton Woods Institutions and with the participation of the World Trade Organisation , also including representatives of civil society and the private sector , and with high-level level dialogue in the United Nations General Assembly , held every two years .
One item in their programme proposes to increase the age limit for family unification by marriage to 24 years .
The 43 million potential beneficiaries of this programme require that we make a huge effort and do not avoid budgetary expenditure under any circumstances .
It does seem as if those who can pay for their security can be sure of it , and those who are not in a position to do so are at greater risk .
I wished to make a very brief comment and make two procedural points which I believe may facilitate the vote on this report during tomorrow &quot; s plenary sitting .
Mr President , I believe that the way in which we set our agenda and plan our business must be improved in the daily conduct of our work .
In this respect , I believe that we should welcome this excellent report by Mr Aldo . For me , it represents at least the beginning of one aspect of the Community &apos; s action in the area of development aid .
It is not by chance that almost all European island regions are Objective 1 .
Here in this House , in Spain and in many other countries , we have all fixed on El Ejido . Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening , not only in El Ejido , but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment .
The statistical review which was carried out in 2002 led to an increase in Greece &apos; s debt ratio in 2001 , which rose to 7 % of GDP higher than the figure previously estimated .
It is true that this debate has arisen here because there have been a great number of floods in Europe that are probably the result of bad water management , but it is also true that currently the biggest plan proposed in Europe for radical change in water management is in our country .
It seems obvious to me that all the countries of West Africa are the Union &apos; s partners by means of the ACP Convention , and are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement and , therefore , do not only have a special relationship with the European Union , but also receive very considerable funds - we are talking about EUR 13 billion - for cooperation projects .
Mr Ephremidis , when we consider Classical Greece and its artistic riches , we are all Greek .
There is another thing that we need to take into account : Europe and its countryside are the result of the work of man ; they have been produced by farmers as the gardeners of the countryside .
It would also seem appropriate to me that the scheme should remain 100 % EU funded , since I feel that at times such as this the aid cannot and should not be dependent on each Member State &apos; s capabilities , if we do not wish to go into those capabilities in detail .
We need a reform that preserves the best of what we are .
The City of Strasbourg , as Mr Stubb has said , has published a note .
It also strengthens the Union &apos; s credibility in the eyes of third countries , as the European Union has always demanded the fulfilment of human rights in its bilateral relations .
I am concerned that Europe is currently making its voice heard through the G7 - no longer the G8 - rather than through ECOFIN and the Commission .
It is extraordinary that , despite the ill treatment inflicted on them , there was not a single witness or defendant who confirmed in the trial the statements that had been extracted from them in police stations .
It is a problem that we will be unable to solve without further development in the countries of origin .
The European Parliament already has full involvement in those agreements , and that is how it will be for the forthcoming agreement , upon which the Commission has not yet made any recommendations .
As to the legal basis , Parliament &quot; s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has confirmed that Article 95 of the Treaty is the only appropriate legal basis for this proposal .
There cannot be a first-tier tier neighbourhood policy and another , second-tier tier , neighbourhood policy .
The main problem is a lack of solidarity within the Union .
Mr Bowis has the floor . We have great affection and respect for him and are pleased to see he has recovered .
It would require a very complex and profound debate to deal with this issue .
The renewable and alternative sources of energy we advocate are expensive .
We need to continue in this direction .
There are great opportunities as well as serious risks .
We welcome the outcome of the vote regarding the conferring of competences which , as we and the vast majority of Parliament understand it , should be given to the Commission .
I must begin by saying that I have voted in favour , because , as a whole , we have genuinely improved the safety aspects , the environmental aspects , the aspects relating to human health and also the aspects relating to the interests of European companies .
It is essential to create teaching programmes aimed at preventing violence , to be used in schools and adult education centres .
Europe cannot adopt a head-in in-the the-sand sand policy .
I urge the Commission to be consistent as it presents this year &apos; s draft budget proposals . It must honour the undertakings given at the Madrid Summit .
This is , I believe , in harmony with the form of governance that we are seeking to adopt on the Commission &apos; s proposal and that would be beneficial to the Agency itself , because in this way , the external agency does not have to mean lesser control of Community funds , a control which is the responsibility of the European Parliament .
Furthermore , this is a health and safety directive , which is intended to eliminate risks at origin , although a specific directive - 93 / 42 / EEC , for example - obliges the manufacturer to comply with essential requirements .
It is also clear , however , that the interests of the European people , and of any race in the world , are increasingly determined by the common destiny of humanity .
The market should be transparent , but it should be subject to democratic values and the political and social rights of the people .
A nuclear vessel , suffering a fault classified as serious , is going to be repaired in a small port which is not equipped for the purpose , when more than 300 thousand people live in the vicinity .
Why must the President of the Council be a prime minister ?
Mr President , Mr Leterme , on behalf of those in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament responsible for employment and social affairs , I would like to join my fellow Members in congratulating the Belgian Presidency on the last six months .
The Commission is also aware that in recent debates that have taken place in the Permanent Representatives Committee ( Coreper ) , the majority supported the 2018 deadline , as Mr Rapkay &apos; s report suggests .
&apos; Let us unite men &quot; , said Monnet .
Likewise , it would seem to be a good idea to extend the programme duration to three years .
I would ask that we separate , on the one hand , the effects of this year &apos; s heat wave from , on the other , a problem which is endemic in the south of Europe , in the Mediterranean countries : the problem of forest fires .
We will also include an evaluation in the report of what we the European institutions have done in application of the reforms required for the Lisbon Community programme .
As you said , the impact of the protocol on fish populations in Senegalese waters is minimal , given that the fisheries activities of the European Union only represent between 1.7 % and 3 % of total catches in the area .
And this new stability plan for the Balkans seems to me to be a positive thing .
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments .
The Council wanted the Committee of Experts to control all cooperation projects relating to South Africa with a budget of over EUR 3 million .
If we say that this is multi-dimensional dimensional , that it has to defend citizens , the landscape , the culture and all those aspects that shape European life , why should this be defended in agriculture but not in fisheries ?
Mr President , Commissioner , although Commisioner Wallström is not with us today , I would like to start by saying , on behalf of the European Parliament &apos; s delegation to the 8th Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention , how much we appreciate her cooperation with delegations from the House at the various conferences she has attended .
Although they are not sufficient , the two vessels chartered by the Commission and other measures taken with regard to fishing for tuna in coastal waters were decisive in reducing tension and avoiding the sad events of 1994 .
I believe not , that everybody has a different approach .
Today more than ever before , there is a need to find answers to the crisis , to research , to climate change , to water , to new energy models , to sustainable development .
Consequently , the text of the proposed regulation has taken a long time to draw up , and even then it has been judged to be unspecific and incomplete , since it does not include implementation procedures .
I think that the European Union should now consider for these island regions with additional difficulties a legal system which is not based on secondary legislation of simple regulations or directives which are then open to challenge before the Court of Justice , but on constitutional treatment in the Treaty establishing the Union .
This is a common feeling that goes beyond personal sympathy for the new government and which is combined with a broad common agenda on which we can work , and which is here , and is explained very well in the report that we are to vote on tomorrow .
The first aspect is the reference periods for the application of Article 6 ( maximum weekly working time ) : four months , as laid down in Article 16 of the Directive , or , where appropriate , the possibility of extension in the cases laid down in Article 17 : up to six and twelve months if implemented by means of collective agreements or agreements between social partners .
The Commission realised then that shipowners and crews could not be left unprotected while the negotiations continued , which is why the proposal for a Regulation that is being voted on today was presented in order to change the legal basis of the FIFG Regulation with two objectives : on the one hand , enabling the aid to be extended for 6 more months , until 30 June , and on the other hand , authorising the Member States concerned to exceed the threshold of 4 % of the FIFG budget that they may use for aid due to the inactivity of the fleet . The period had , obviously due to the extraordinary nature of the situation , had already been long exceeded .
There are more difficulties with other amendments , such as those which refer to the exporting of unsafe products to the Third World and to the safety of services .
The reports by Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck reflect Parliament &apos; s concerns and priorities in relation to these issues and I therefore join in congratulating them on their excellent work .
Mr President , we are now discussing the fifth amendment in two years to the regulation on technical measures for the conservation of juveniles of marine organisms .
The consequences of this situation hit the poorest even harder .
I envisage specific courses of action . First , we must strengthen and develop international law .
Well , now we must explain this Constitution , we must state what is positive about it and that , without it , we would be heading for the paralysis represented by the Treaty of Nice .
The European Union &quot; s policy on Cuba must be born of reason , as is the case with so many other places , and must take account of the real needs of the Cuban people .
No one knows any longer whether it is the seventh , eighth or ninth .
Nor must we forget that livestock are dying of thirst .
This is not the first attempt to turn the Commission into a world-class class public service , but we , Mr Prodi , wish to believe in the sincerity and resolve of your promise to this House .
The European Union must take this element as a point of reference , but the applicant countries should also involve themselves in the Lisbon strategy by adopting its objectives as far as possible .
This text , practically in the same words I have just used , is included in our synthesis report .
This would represent a major contribution to the construction of the European Union .
During these eight years of practical application we have learnt various lessons .
If the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee are consultative bodies of the Council and are given their own section , why was the Ombudsman going to be included in Parliament &apos; s section of the budget ?
There are many amendments , which are enormously technical , which are intended , if I have understood correctly , to bring the Commission &quot; s proposal closer to the text resulting from the activities of the Council which for its part has held many meetings on this project , in the presence of experts .
Despite the severe budgetary restrictions we currently face , the message that the Council will send out in its meeting on Friday will be one of commitment , using positive terms to express the significance of this matter at European level and the vital importance for each Member State to invest in low-carbon carbon technology .
The S &amp; D Group has mentioned how significant it would be for the High Representative to be a member of this political family , but there is no doubt that it is also important to ensure a gender balance .
1 ) Improving the quality and competitiveness of our companies ;
In any event , the European Union must be an agent for peace and international humanitarian law and it must assist the ICRC in its task of guaranteeing that this law is upheld .
On the other hand however , there are other rights which must also be protected , such as the right to information or the right to privacy .
With regard to Cyprus , the ordinary negotiations have continued normally ; I must say that Cyprus is an excellent candidate , the southern part of Cyprus , the Republic of Cyprus , is certainly the candidate for whom the greatest number of negotiation chapters are concluded and which has made the most progress in the negotiation .
That is essential .
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dictates this Parliament &apos; s political and legislative activity for the next five years .
This asymmetry causes tension and demands a response from the European institutions , from the Commission and from the Council and Parliament .
I simply want to point out that the first technical meeting took place on 29 October and the next will take place on 8 November .
I would also like to say to all of those people who have always noted a degree of rivalry between the national Parliaments and the European Parliament that our main allies in this Convention have been the national Parliaments .
Let us take one case : the tax reduction measures adopted last year as a result of the oil crisis .
Outright rejection of the Council &apos; s proposal does not seem wise if we are to move ahead with the Statute according to the agreed timetable .
In any case , we think the position adopted by ourselves and the rapporteur , Mr Rosado Fernandes , is rather more realistic and appropriate to the general problem of Community production than the position expressed , for example , by the draftsman of opinion of the Committee on Budgets .
Mr President , all the issues relating to the internal market are more directly the responsibility of Commissioner Bolkestein , but in any event I take good note of what both you and Mr Bautista Ojeda have said to me and we will try to analyse it .
In the first half of 2010 , in the Association Council and the Association Committee with Turkey , we will have a chance to assess the development of our relations ; it will be a good opportunity to examine significant problems , such as the political criteria , the progress made in adapting national legislation and the application of the acquis .
What is the Council going to do to stop this happening ?
That is what I am in fact doing in transport , in the ports , in the other sectors of transport and in energy .
Mr President , the reply from the President-in in-Office Office of the Council is very clear indeed : there may be no discussion of this kind of issue .
Venezia vuole vivere e deve vivere !
And we must make the two things compatible in the eyes of the population , of the citizens of Europe .
Mr President , the violation of human rights in Peru is another case in the long list of cases occurring in Latin American countries with the connivance of a complacent United States .
With regard to the issue we are dealing with - the anomalous situation of the British submarine Tireless in the only British colony in the Mediterranean , Gibraltar - on 7 September I asked an oral question about it .
Therefore , unfortunately this part of your programme , which for us is substantial , does not change or alter anything and does not introduce anything new .
Action must therefore be taken against speculation , along with a policy encouraging the holding of sufficient strategic stock to avoid speculation .
The present government has a certain degree of balance .
I would like to mention two key points : firstly , the Commission proposes a better structure for the cycle of policy coordination based on three points : execution , political orientations and guidelines .
In any case , the debate has been enormously interesting and I hope that what I have heard today will not be an obstacle , however , so that we can move forward with the approval of the distribution of resources , the distribution of loans , as from next year and that Community procedures are not delayed .
It is true that last year , in 2009 , hundreds of prisoners were released ; however , very few were actually political prisoners .
Between 13 and 19 September some of us were visiting some of the poorest regions of the planet , in the south of the African continent .
This was presented at the end of 2001 to the European Council , the Space Agency and Parliament .
Therefore , we say yes to negotiated readmission within the framework of global development programmes , but no to forced repatriation , especially when this is paid for from development funds .
Moreover , European coal is coal that can be clean .
Mr Karas has done an excellent job trying to remedy a mistaken proposal on the basic content of the Stability Pact .
These are very important decisions .
And if there is an Amendment No 6 , a separate vote .
The change from collectivised farming economies to situations that can be merged with the Community situation may trigger off speculative processes that will artificially raise market prices for land and thus increase young farmers &apos; difficulties in setting up or keeping themselves in the countryside .
In any case , these EUR 280 million are not part of the Dairy Fund , but rather we are talking about a one-off off intervention .
I would like to do so because we cannot allow a third disaster to take place . We cannot , following the Erika and the Prestige , allow another Erika or Prestige to sully our coasts .
I will begin by pointing out that there are still currently certain significant problems in the Member States with regard to access to spatial information and its use , due , amongst other things , to the fragmentation of data sets and sources , gaps in availability , lack of harmonisation between data sets at different geographical scales and duplication of information collection .
And to this scenario must be added the ups and downs suffered by this directive .
Transparency and openness in the markets , knowledge management , innovation management and the transfer of technology , efficiency in our processes and products and accepting and practising social and environmental responsibility in all sectors are some of the most important elements .
Mr President , there is no doubt that the conflict which has been going on in Colombia for more than thirty years cannot be resolved by military means .
The English playwright , poet and actor William Shakespeare was born on a different 23 April , according to the Julian calendar , and is regarded as the most important writer in the English language and also one of the giants of world literature .
It is a breeding ground for the informal economy and organised crime .
Next year three new Member States will also have joined the Economic and Monetary Union , sharing the single currency with 318 million other Europeans .
And finally , Mr President , frankly , I am not going to give examples , but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy .
We therefore ask , for example , that it be explicitly forbidden to give public subsidies to anyone acting illegally , as in the case of Armadores Vidal .
Following the Madrid meeting of the eighteen &apos; Friends of the Constitution &apos; , with the two who have said that they are going to ratify it and those who have yet to speak - their silence is deafening - I believe that it is important to support what the President-in in-Office Office of the Council has said . I would like to make one comment however , and that is that if we have to do anything , we must use the pen more than the scissors , because to defend the substance alone is dangerous , particularly if we start pruning .
We note that everything from the protection of hazelnut cultivation to a pilot project for helping victims of terrorism has been included .
I would ask you to do everything you possibly can to make this possible .
Mr President , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , may I briefly present the position of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party on the situation in the Middle East .
The communication discusses , and the report also focuses on , the external and internal causes of immigration , the need for codevelopment policies and a new partnership with the countries of origin , a common European legislative framework to organise entry in a fair , transparent and straightforward way , residency and integration , which to me means rights .
There have been errors which are statistically normal in a vote of this length .
The next item is the joint debate on :
This means that the next summit is not going to be a North-South South summit , like the previous summits , but a summit between equals . In that respect , I think that we should look back , if only briefly , and feel satisfied at what has been achieved in the last few years .
I can see Mr Evans , Mrs Scheele , my friend Philippe Morillon , Mrs Nicholson and Mr Schröder .
The existence of 14 protocols and other such statements in itself constitutes a failure by the European Council which did not have the political stature historically required to move forward in unity whilst preserving diversity .
I am not going to comment on the eight amendments that were adopted , as we are all in agreement with them .
We therefore raise the following questions : must the future legislative framework on economic governance be in line with the model of a social Europe and Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU ?
It is possible that for many of them their only hope is that the European institutions will take equality seriously , both for the women within the Union and for all of those who , because they are outside the Union , encounter many more difficulties fulfilling their expectations of life .
Now , in order to respond to the legitimate concerns of the Community &apos; s fruit and vegetable producers , Parliament must call on the Commission to present proposals , which we shall comment on once they have been made .
Furthermore , in doing so we will be applying the same approach to that country as we do to China , Vietnam , Iran , Israel , Syria , Libya , Equatorial Guinea , Sudan and also the United States and dozens of other countries in which we note very serious shortcomings , which in many cases are much more serious than those in Cuba , in terms of freedoms , human rights and the Rule of Law , but with which we talk and cooperate precisely with a view to improving the things we do not like .
In principle , it largely follows the route of the current conventional line .
However , we are repeating the error of not harmonising diplomatic efforts at national and European level , which weaken us economically and geopolitically .
For the Commission , the ideal solution would be to only include ports which , as well as complying with these limits , are equipped with transhipment facilities .
In truth , through his actions and proposals , Mr Fischler , the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture , has made the anti-Mediterranean Mediterranean impact of enlargement a reality .
I would like to put a few very simple questions to Mr Almunia , without the difficulties of translation . What do you think about amending the Maastricht Treaty criteria to perhaps include a new criterion relating to the balance of payments , a maximum limit on the current account deficit and external debt ?
This Parliament is going to adopt a very tough resolution , expressing its inescapable commitment to the cause of human rights and to all those in Cuba and outside it who are fighting for its freedom and its dignity .
The Rules of Procedure also lay down that , should an elected Member resign from Parliament before this report has been adopted in plenary , the vacancy and the name of the new Member shall be verified , pursuant to Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure in conjunction with the relevant provisions of the Act of 20 September 1976 , in a separate procedure independent of this report and which will take place at a convenient time .
We should like this collection of know-how how , &apos; star cases &apos; and good administrative behaviour to be specifically included in the campaign supported by Parliament .
This is the responsibility of some very important international organisations and there is a desperate need for international cooperation to combat one of the most shameful violations of human rights ; international cooperation of European police forces and judges with police and judges in the countries where the migrants come from , who also have responsibility for the problem .
Finally , we must call on those attending the Kivu Conference to produce a set of specific results demanding justice and acceptance of responsibility , because if , after all that has happened , rapists finally enjoy impunity wearing the uniforms of the official army of the Republic of the Congo , the victims will be humiliated twice - first during the rape itself , and again when they see it was carried out with impunity .
What has happened is that the Member States have transferred some of their competences and powers to the European Union , so they are not exercised by the Member States but by the European Union . The European Union could therefore theoretically infringe the European Convention on Human Rights .
At the moment , the examination of all the stability and coordination plans and the substantial improvement of the broad guidelines for economic policy is being studied by this Parliament &apos; s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which intends , if I am not mistaken , to present its report to Parliament in April .
In my opinion , there have been three changes .
Mr Galeote referred to me personally , accusing me of demonstrating party-political political motives for having raised the issue of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Dell &apos; Utri &apos; s immunity .
I want to report that in the south of the Union , in the industrious and enterprising city of Valencia , there is an historic marine quarter called Cabañal , which could be destroyed by a plan that the council wants to implement after abandoning the area for almost 20 years .
With regard to modulation , I would suggest , Commissioner , that you consider what the regional competence may be in those Member States where agriculture falls within it .
Geography and history make Europe the natural ally of the countries in the Mediterranean region .
In this respect , the double standards with which aid policy is sometimes applied are unacceptable , and we are also concerned by the contradictions that can arise in the conduct of Member States , or some States , and the European Union itself .
This is absolutely disproportionate and in no way helps the peace process .
My first observation concerns the need to include the European Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations .
The world has changed since the days of Monnet and Schuman you said , and that is true .
This is not an ideological issue .
We hope that this matter is cleared up and that , if this is not the case , this part of the report can be sent back to the committee , in order to facilitate the development of the aforementioned foreign and defence policy for , as I say , we should not continue with the current approach , given that we have to achieve a better understanding and a better clarification of procedures carried out to date .
Results are achieved if a neighbour really wishes to cooperate .
The concentration of ozone , as we know , is due to the accumulation in the atmosphere of precursor agents , but there is no easy solution , of course , to eradicating them , because these precursor agents sometimes act to reduce ozone in the atmosphere .
I would recommend ...
a single labour market for researchers , which means establishing a single European career path in the field of research and an integrated information system for jobs and training contracts ;
The European Union &quot; s volume of fishing is very moderate and I naturally agree with the rapporteur &quot; s complaint that there is a kind of discrimination , by virtue of which , in the agreements with the south , it is the fishermen who have to pay , while in the case of the agreements with the north , this increase in payments that they now want to impose on us is not happening .
All this when we are striving to bring the temperature in the region down rather than allowing it to rise .
I agree wholeheartedly with this statement .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur for the work that she has done , despite all the pressure that we have all been under .
Secondly , Mr President , how long are we going to be living with a United Nations Security Council in which there is an anachronistic right of veto for the winners of the Second World War enshrined in the San Francisco Charter in 1945 ?
We are pleased to note that , when we talk about the figures relating to development in Sweden , the remaining convergence criteria are being complied with even more comfortably than in the past .
Our main priority is to ensure that the Daphne Programme moves forward .
The Commission has made a clearer commitment in this regard .
Although the principles behind the proposal - &apos; the user pays &apos; and &apos; the polluter pays &apos; - are reasonable , the solution proposed is definitely not , as it will discriminate against a sector which , for months , has been suffering from the disastrous effects of the economic crisis .
Mr President , the violence in Colombia is a matter of great concern to Parliament . We have already passed a series of resolutions in support of the peace process in recent years .
We must not close doors ; we must provide the possibility of review .
I must stress the need for the New Computerised Transit System ( NCTS ) to come into operation soon in all the Member States and the countries associated with the common transit system .
I have said this many times : these agreements must achieve a balance , whereby everyone surrenders a little ground , so we all win . However , in no way must one product or one specific sector be forced to bear the cost of the agreements .
I would say that next week , in Seville , the message of the Heads of State and Government will be along these lines , in the hope that the already nascent actions to decrease the tension that are taking place will increase with every passing day and that we will be able , at the end of next week , to see a situation that is calmer than the one we saw a few days ago .
Proof of this lies in both the proposal the Commission is putting forward with regard to the entry of citizens from third countries and the other documents Parliament has recently received , for example , on the strategy adopted by the Council .
To this end , at the General Affairs Council on 18 February , both regulations were approved , establishing a uniform model for visas and a uniform model for the form for issuing a visa granted by Member States to holders of a travel document not recognised by the Member State issuing that form .
The code of good conduct , which forms part of the Monti package , referred to the fiscal distortions that could alter the functioning of the internal market .
We should not forget that this is an official visit by a delegation from this House and that one of its most important objectives is to discover the facts about the circumstances reported to us .
For this reason , it will be necessary that the regulations which will govern the Structural Funds in the future , in the way expressed by the Commissioner or in an even more detailed way , will deal with implementing them positively and integrally in this common heritage , within the framework of a rigorous regional policy , with the aim of making progress in the cohesion of our regions and our peoples .
I would like to make some specific comments , Mr President .
This attitude cannot be permitted from a supposed partner .
Are we going to replace animal meal with genetically modified soya , imported from the United States ?
At the end of this process , moreover , Mr President , I believe we must put it to a referendum .
Having clarified that , why am I in favour of consolidating the tax base and why do I approve and applaud the report by Mr Bersani ?
My long political experience , particularly in foreign policy , has taught me that it is not always those who shout the loudest or pass the most forceful resolutions who achieve the best results .
Transparency and the public &apos; s trust in the institutions are an essential condition both for the very existence of the institutional system and to guarantee that it runs smoothly . And this is particularly true in an enlarged Europe .
Ladies and gentlemen , as I take the chair for this sitting , all of you will understand if I express to you my sorrow and consternation at the death of Jorge Semprún , which took place a few hours ago , at the age of 87 .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking Mr Watson for his work , laying out the role the European Union must play in the fight against terrorism .
We are talking about a serious social problem , and every possible effort will be required on our part if we are to put an end to it .
Curiously , this removal of the APIM has not had the desired effect amongst the sensitive industries in the Canary Islands and therefore the Spanish authorities , the Canarian authorities and the economic operators affected have requested that the Community authorities amend Regulation 1911 / 91 in order to stop the removal of the APIM until June 2000 , which the European Commission appreciates .
It is true that there are others which are still much less developed , such as discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation .
There is also the issue of Roma children : it is said that their life expectancy is 10 years shorter than that of the average European child .
Eighty-seven seven per cent of those are sent to the European Union , mainly to Denmark , that is , 97 % .
In this regard , we should condemn the fact that the national regulatory authorities of certain countries - such as Spain , Germany , Sweden and the United Kingdom - are not playing their part to the full , which has led to complaints from new companies , who have found that the telecommunications monopolies that already exist are placing obstacles in their way and delaying the consolidation of free competition to the detriment of users .
A concerted response to the crisis must take the developing countries into account and their agenda must form an essential component of global economic cooperation .
Ladies and gentlemen , the creation of a European framework for cogeneration is a great challenge .
Last year , Morocco withdrew from the negotiating table and , like a good player who has won , ended up with all the cards and did not forfeit a single concession .
This has been done by the Council of Europe and the United Nations , and of various parliaments and governments all over the world .
With regard to things that are happening today , in another camp of displaced people , rather than being protected , women have been raped and are being prevented from reaching ...
Community fishing activity in itself does not interfere with small-scale scale fleets , since our fleet does not have access to the twelve mile zone .
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years , but you have not done so for the CFP , with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context , in the context of globalisation .
What we say is , yes , let the Treaty be revised , but without a Convention , so that a start can be made to the right to that confirmation .
However , for more than a decade , the levels of interoperability of the European networks have not gone beyond 7 % and it is the requirement for national approval of locomotives and traction units in each of the Member States where these are to be used that is currently one of the main barriers to the creation of new railway companies dedicated to the transport of passengers and freight , and also a major obstacle to the interoperability of the European railway system .
The difficulties involved in achieving the intended objective of the Directive are , in my opinion , threefold : firstly , the concept of insolvency ; secondly , the complexity of the arrangement introduced to allow a time and quantity limits to be placed on the guarantee ; thirdly , insolvency cases with a cross-border border dimension .
I think it is a success .
The European funds from the Solidarity Fund must be added , as Mrs Miguélez has pointed out .
To this end , Mrs McNally , I therefore propose to establish an interservices group , consisting of all those Commission services whose policies and programmes relate to the present programme .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Roithová for such a wonderful report .
This amendment supplements the Council approach , which is purely commercial , and opts for a proposal with wider economic , human and food quality aims .
Thank you very much , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , for the information you have just given me .
And the reality in the European Union in terms of health in the workplace , without wanting to be alarmist , is that in 1999 there were 5 500 accidents resulting in fatalities , 4.8 million accidents leading to more than 3 days of inability to work , 500 million working days lost as a result of accidents or health problems , compensation payments and , what is more serious , almost 350 000 people had to change job or their place of work - around 300 000 with some degree of disability - and 15 000 will never be able to take on a new job .
I think that the most fundamental duty of the Commission is transparency before the Member States and if the institution over which Mr Santer presides thought that the Community laws - including the judgments of the European Court in Luxembourg - could be interpreted as by Mr Santer , that opinion should have been put before all the Member States and not merely before one - and within the framework in which the problem had arisen .
The Council has been working closely with other interested parties , such as the United States , Russia and the United Nations ; proof of this is the summit taking place today in Madrid between the four players I have mentioned - the United States , Russia , the United Nations and the Presidency of the European Union . It has also been in contact with countries in the region .
Mr President , since you have asked us not to take up the time allotted , and in summary , I will say that one of the main contributions which the European Union could make in this difficult situation - and I believe there is good reason , as I have just pointed out , not to leave the matter exclusively in the hands of the Organisation of American States - should be , in my opinion , to promote , on the basis of a guarantee of the full exercise of all civil and political rights , a consensus amongst all the forces which would allow democracy to be recovered , strengthened and deepened in Peru .
In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 63 , the Council will have to adopt measures which define the conditions under which nationals of third countries , who reside legally in a Member State , may reside in other Member States .
Mr President , at a time when our citizens are apprehensive about the future , it is our duty to remember always that peace and prosperity in our Union require a daily search for the greatest common advantage , and that will not be achieved without a strong , democratic and respected Parliament .
Thirdly , with regard to intelligence and cooperation amongst information services , which accounts for at least 70 % of the fight against terrorism , I am going to make a single reference to a point Mr Clarke has discussed at some length , namely the issue of telecommunications .
And this is the case in all respects : economic , social , cultural , scientific and political .
The Commission has also reiterated here and now that the reform will not have a negative impact on producers &quot; incomes either . To date , however , the Commission has failed to respond to the question concerning the effect of the reform on employment .
Today more than ever we must make the statement that only cooperation , dialogue , economic and cultural exchanges , solidarity and mutual understanding can turn the two sides of the Mediterranean into a prosperous and peaceful area .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , The EU produces 20 million hectolitres of alcohol annually , of which 13 million hectolitres are of agricultural origin and the rest of the Union &apos; s production is what is known as synthetic alcohol .
I believe this is important .
Amongst other things , this text does not recognise the specific needs of regions with legislative competence , or the right of those regions to participate in the decision-making making process on issues which concern them .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , as the Nicaraguan writer Sergio Ramírez has pointed out , the political map of Latin America can be interpreted today by means of some diverse and highly contrasting landmarks .
One aspect of this area of freedom , security and justice is what has been called the Stockholm Programme , at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is already opening up this area not only to the intergovernmental sphere but also to the sphere that is strictly and clearly the EU . It is clearly particular to the EU method and therefore gives Parliament and the Court of Justice leading roles that they did not have before .
It is the case that this year the time scales for the debate , in order for the Commission and Council to take account of Parliament &quot; s opinion expressed in these reports , have been particularly short , but this is due to the beginning of the cycle and the very tight timetable available to all the institutions in order to begin this new cycle of coordination of economic policies , within the context of a review of the Lisbon Strategy .
I would like to point out that at the last Ministerial Conference in San José , held last February under the British Presidency , the way in which the European Parliament delegation was treated was obviously wrong . It was in fact treated worse than the delegations from third countries .
It should be pointed out that , given the unit value of the products , this measure cannot be seen as extreme . It is a relatively small percentage .
I would like to know how this rather odd situation has come about .
The best example of this is Chile , but Brazil , under Fernando Enrique Cardoso , also seems to be coping under difficult circumstances .
Brittany and Galicia , two European &apos; Lands Ends &apos; , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks .
I would also like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that its Vice-President President is here - to study as carefully as possible how the European Union can respond with solidarity in the face of a disaster of this type , whether in the form of emergency aid or of reconstruction and rehabilitation , given that Mexico is a positive and active partner of the European Union and is linked to the Union by means of an Association Agreement and shares our system of values , as demonstrated recently on the issues of the death penalty , the International Criminal Court and the various debates that have been held recently within the United Nations .
&apos; that forecasts show that climate change is capable of modifying the availability and demand for water all over the planet &apos; ;
And I have had the opportunity over recent days - I have spent the whole week in New York talking to the Secretary-General General , Kofi Annan , and in Washington with Vice-President President Cheney , Secretary of State Powell and the President &apos; s adviser , Condoleezza Rice - to try to discover whether we are able to give further joint impetus in the face of this terrible situation in the Middle East .
On the contrary , in the current Member States , government and opposition should leave aside party-political political confrontation in the face of this great Union objective .
I am referring to the full autonomy , to the exclusive capacity and competence which the Basque Country enjoys from a fiscal point of view , from the point of view of the collection of taxes , rates and public levies , as well as with regard to budgets and public spending .
Mr President , I would like to ask the Commissioner how this institutional participation is envisaged .
Mr President , I believe it is sad that we had to experience the attacks of 11 September for certain analyses and actions to be carried out and for certain objectives to be taken seriously .
And unfortunately this is still not the case .
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community .
This said , I detected a degree of pique in what Mr Poettering said . He seemed to resent that someone who apparently belonged to one side should have defected to the other .
For the first time since reunification , the majority of Member States of the European Union will be part of the euro zone .
To the same end , we believe it is necessary to provide an opportunity to link the national diplomatic corps , whose experience and long tradition are of great value , to our external action , and we therefore propose to implement a &apos; bridging &apos; system between national external services and the Community external service .
However , with the satisfactory development of the Sixth Framework Programme we shall also develop other initiatives , such as better coordination of national programmes , a task we have promoted during our Presidency .
I believe that it is the Union &quot; s duty to take this new reality into account and to lead a strategy that puts an end to the current deadlock , for the sake of two peoples , of two viable States and a fair peace .
And , as is the case with many of the applicant countries , the Czech Republic still has a great deal to do , as the Commission &apos; s regular report rightly points out .
Since their incorporation in 1986 , the Canary Islands have held significant and intense debates .
Unfair practice occurs when an airline that has received State aid in its own country does not use this aid to cover a certain type of cost but to artificially lower prices on routes in which it is in competition with European Union airlines .
Some of you - such as Mrs Ayuso , amongst others - have said that today is an historic day .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if as the European Union we want to construct a coherent energy policy and speak with once voice on the international energy stage , it is essential that we have complete and reliable statistics that enable us to make comparisons easily .
The differences between the parties , however , have probably never been so profound .
Nevertheless , I should remind Members that , every year , the Commission gives consideration to projects which amount to three times the amount allocated annually in this budget .
In the process of reaching an agreement we will therefore see to it that the Union &apos; s support for fishing is consolidated and increased .
They do exist , but we still have problems to resolve .
However , I would like to highlight the hard work , which has been notable and entirely praiseworthy , almost Herculean , of the rapporteur , Mr Rothley , throughout the process , from the conception of the basic idea to the follow-up up , full of passion and rigour , of the legislative work that has been carried out .
The recognition of women &apos; s rights as an integral and indivisible component of universal human rights requires the adoption of accompanying measures which will allow this recognition to be transposed into concrete actions .
However , we completely disagree with the fact that Member States may continue to contribute up to 25 % of the cost for production regions located outside of Objective 1 .
Mr President , I was also in Jenin yesterday and I was amazed , as a doctor and a teacher in the Faculty of Medicine , as a professor , at the words of the Director of the Jenin Hospital , when he expressed his regret that he could not attend to the wounded who were dying in the area around the hospital because tanks , machine guns and helicopters were preventing him from doing so .
I will not do so , however , without saying with great feeling that I am not unmoved by the fact that the person who chaired this debate enjoyed the right of asylum because of the generosity and hospitality of the governments and people of France , Austria and Belgium , to whom I would like to pay a tribute of thanks here today , because there is no time limitation on gratitude , even though this happened more than 40 years ago .
As you know , some were already complaining before the agreement was renewed .
In fact , the Commission has condemned this situation recently .
The second requirement of our proposal is that the buses pass a specific manoeuvrability test .
We cannot have any transitional presidencies .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Liberal Group , I would firstly like to express our support for Mr Trentin &apos; s report .
I have personally been able to observe how we rapporteurs , who are obliged to carry out the discharge of the various fields , are subject to external pressure , are put under pressure from the political groups to work in a particular direction .
Unless this happens , the Council will bear a degree of responsibility , or rather a great deal of responsibility , for this delay and the ministers will have to explain themselves to the public .
We are doing so because we feel that it will increase guarantees for the public , because what we are doing is giving more guarantees to people that the European Union legislation applied by the Member States and European Union laws is in line with the set of rights recognised in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights .
This is precisely why trade policy is so important .
This is why it is increasingly important that Europe finally equips itself with an efficient instrument .
The resolution which were are now debating is a mixture of styles , of individual contributions , whose result is an extraordinarily unequal combination .
I am aware that the Portuguese Presidency is coming to an end because this half-year year is fairly short , but I do not know whether you think it will be possible for a specific proposal to be formulated before 31 December , or whether you will encourage the Commission to submit more specific proposals , especially with regard to the institutional aspects , whether the mechanisms we have today are sufficient or whether it would be appropriate to establish an institution of some kind to facilitate circular migration of this nature .
I am talking specifically about the independent authority that is to be set up to make what is always a very difficult decision : whether to admit a vessel in distress into a place of refuge .
I would simply like to thank the staff very much for the speed with which they have worked . I would also like to thank the political groups for their capacity for dialogue on this issue of immigration , which is normally controversial but which requires the agreement of all of us in order to impose common sense and useful policies .
Why July 2002 , some of you are asking .
The Greek Government was notified of the decision and sent its comments on more than one occasion .
I would like to congratulate , by name , Rosa Díez , Jaime Mayor , Stavros Lambrinidis , Antoine Duquesne , Mario Borghezio and Alexander Nuno Alvaro .
This exercise in the discharge of the EDF , which we ritually tackle each year , should serve as an illustration , once again , of the ridiculous situation where Parliament inspects the discharge of funds that do not figure in the Community budget , the amounts of which we are not consulted on and on whose expenditure we are only informed of a posteriori .
Finally , the Commission and the European Investment Bank are looking into optimum financial packages for major demonstration projects , and so we also urge the Commission to analyse new ways of combining resources from different sources and to develop an ad hoc tool for financing the commercial launch of low-carbon carbon technologies .
And I do not understand how anybody can live with that on their conscience .
The solution , in fact , is to put an end to all kinds of piracy . I mean , to put an end to piracy based in Somalia and also to foreign piracy that is wreaking havoc in Somali territorial waters .
The European Union summits with the United States and Canada helped to strengthen the transatlantic link .
I would like to highlight the same point as Ms McKenna , but with a slight correction .
We also share her desire for their application to be speeded up .
The second is the British Presidency &quot; s prioritisation of the eradication of poverty , with particular emphasis on Africa .
Mr President , as far as the Greens are concerned , it is not a matter of apportioning blame , but of seeking an effective means of remedying a catastrophe such as this , or rather the chronicle of catastrophes which occur daily in the Straits of Gibraltar .
It is important , ladies and gentlemen , because we have to build Europe based on our strengths , so we need to follow those countries that have done things well .
During that period , athletes , artists and their families , as well as pilgrims , could travel safely to participate in the Games and return to their homes unharmed .
I will end , Mr President , by saying that our Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 137 of the Treaty oblige us to resist the wishes of those who do not want European rules .
The Socialist Group therefore supports the amendments of the rapporteur , Mr Stevenson , and those of the Committee on Budgets .
On the contrary , we are surrounded by women who are much more valuable than us , my wife to name but one .
In my opinion , this is an essential element .
We feel that the European institutions must now draw attention to this matter .
Nevertheless , I would like to express a few humble opinions that may be a little discordant but which I believe may add some things that have not been said .
Now we need this Regulation so that we can appropriately implement what was signed with the United States .
As far as this House is concerned , these are facts confirmed by the vote in Council and we are left to point out that this measure has caused great concern among producers in the other Member States . We must also stress that this exceptional measure is not provided for in the Regulation and that other Member States have also suffered bad weather at times but they have not had the advantage which Portugal is now enjoying .
Nevertheless , I would like the Commission for its part to understand the problems the delay experienced has already caused Parliament . For the first time , Parliament is going to implement a budgetary year in the light of the evaluation report based on the annual policy strategy document .
What most interested me about the proposal that we have seen in writing and what you have said is that there only need to be a few objectives : only the top-priority priority objectives ; that they need to be tangible , that we need to be able to measure them and they need to be constantly evaluated in order to see whether or not we are making progress in that direction .
Firstly , the European register of protection orders , with the corresponding privacy guarantees , in order to prevent bureaucracy for the beneficiaries and have the orders applied immediately .
We in Murcia are also suffering the consequences of the crisis caused by the collapse of the pork sector , which incidentally should be receiving aid from the European Union .
The Commission is now proposing to open up Tempus III to the Mediterranean partners in order to meet the needs in that region for cooperation in the sphere of higher education .
This means that this is not an internal issue of Lithuanian policy . Put simply , we must conclude that we are facing an issue that directly affects the survival of European credibility .
So , my specific question is whether that means acceptance of the US position on these questions and the indirect adoption of the Helms-Burton Burton Act .
Once again we are going to defend the right for third-country country nationals who are long-term term residents to vote in local and European elections .
I believe that it would be irresponsible for us to accept that request and I therefore call upon all the honourable Members to vote against it , as the Council and the European Commission also propose , and I thank them for all of their efforts to avoid a possible conciliation procedure .
As for the social aspects , they were completely absent from the Green Paper .
That , therefore , is the reason why , when the time comes to vote on these reports , the Socialist Group will continue to refine its positions in order , above all , to protect the interests of the normal , ordinary citizen , and not just the interests of the most powerful .
The same can be said of Amendments Nos 11 , 15 , 16 and 17 , because they are contrary to the main objective of the proposals , which is to achieve a minimum degree of harmonisation .
We want to move towards a result which provides a balance between opening up trade and subjecting that trade to rules , internal democratic , and external democratic , rules , which respect fundamental social standards , the environment and the security of our consumers .
In particular , the Commission is currently studying the framework of that new strategy which Mr Salafranca referred to ; let us hope that we can soon reach a conclusion that will allow us to release funds to support the Central American Parliament .
The European Union and its institutions must be committed to condemning events that constitute violations of human rights , and working to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again .
It is nearly four years since the 1995 Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Mediterranean Conference , and I believe that the Commission has acted positively in presenting this document on transport in the Mediterranean .
The value of human life must be preserved and not destroyed .
This technical recommendation , which came from and was proposed by Eurocontrol , was unanimously adopted yesterday by the 27 governments of the European Union , therefore giving it a European focus and a European approach to what is needed at the moment .
Or do you believe , Mr President-in in-Office Office , that we are going to be able to deal with the priority of doubling funds for Africa if we have less resources ?
Amendment No 3 could prove helpful in this regard . However things eventually turn out , we have no intention of excluding the sector .
It should also be pointed out that to date , the Community has not adopted a directive aimed at regulating the private security sector .
For that to happen , the Seventh Framework Programme must increase its funding from 2013 onwards .
However , for the reasons I have given , we shall reserve our definitive vote for the result of the Intergovernmental Conference .
The regions may have their competences within a context of decentralisation and the concession of competences by the State to territorial regions .
Without energy , there is no quality of life whatsoever ; without energy , there is no production .
Hence the Community framework for R &amp; D support must be equally valid for the steel sector .
It resorts to violence and terror in an effort to impose its views by force . At the same time it attacks the very core of democratic systems , namely our system of individual and collective freedoms .
Despite the current circumstances following the tragic events of 11 September , tourism will soon be the largest service industry in the European Union .
I am reiterating a hope rather than putting a question , and I hope that the Commission will be as efficient as it has been in restructuring the Ispra centre and will be able to complete its work with the creation of this unit .
Initiatives have sprung up all over the place , a whole range of appointments have been made , boycotts set up but not applied - I am not referring to the country which is forever being condemned , it is the United Kingdom which claims that international contractual obligations prevent it from applying the boycott of air transport .
We will never know how many innocent people there were amongst the approximately 7000 prisoners executed in the United States of America during this century .
It has become clear that the definitive solution to the problem of Colombia does not simply involve an end to the violence , but that we must get to the root of the social and economic problems that are causing this . In order to reach that point , however , peace must first be achieved on the ground .
We need a European policy , along with commitments , resources , initiatives and measures that match up to what we are dealing with .
And I think it is clear that no one in this Chamber wishes to see a return to the logic of violence either .
I am delighted that Mr Maystadt has demonstrated his openness , which in fact I had already seen before , towards reviewing this issue and finding a solution to it , as was previously mentioned in the debate last year .
The EUR 8.6 million in question is the only additional sum Spain is to receive further to the disaster . The only Community aid received to date resulted from reprogramming funds previously allocated to Spain .
From our point of view , it is essential to use the Lomé V debate to consider some vital questions .
I would like to say , without going any further , that in my country the statistics are devastating : 166 000 cases reported to the courts , 48 000 people detained last year ( one every twelve minutes ) and almost 70 women murdered ; the last one yesterday , her throat cut by her partner .
Finally I shall only add that it would be ironic if the legitimate ambition of the current Ombudsman to apply the Code of Administrative Conduct led him to be more diligent outside his home than within it .
I wish to say that the fact the project appears in the trans-European European networks allows the European Union to promote the idea that States - who in the end have to make the great investments - or regions should also plan their large-scale scale works not on the basis of national interest , but in the interest of trans-European European interconnection and hence with a cross-border border vision .
I am accepting mine and you must accept yours .
The Community has just given up the tariff .
Commissioner Bonino is known for not mincing her words .
Why are we talking about the coordination of economic policy ?
We need to lay firm foundations in this field , since nobody is taking responsibility for education .
The American people have done so through the polls .
Madam President , were you aware that the very doors we are opening to young people from the CEECs are being closed to young people from the Maghreb ?
In this case , let us acknowledge what we do well .
People operating a communication network or service on the market are not dealing with any old product , but with services which have a high added value from social and cultural points of view .
After that , it must be properly rolled out , implemented and , if necessary , revised .
I understand the problem , but it would be important for Parliament if Mrs Malliori were present , since she is the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy on this matter .
Although the amendments in the Cercas report soften the text of the directive , they make the current situation worse ( they keep the opt-out out clause for three years and increase the reference period for calculating working hours to six months ) .
Mr Santer , the seriousness of the Commission &apos; s failings in its handling of the BSE affair , and the risks to public health which they produced , are clearly demonstrated by the Committee of Inquiry &apos; s report .
Treasury Ministers are delighted with the income generated by tobacco , whilst Health Ministers rail against it .
The first goal is to ensure that this budget does not simply represent an added burden on national purses . In other words , it must not be a superfluous expense , but must go only where the Member States cannot or must not go .
For this reason , the Court feels that in spite of the progress made the implementation of the Commission &apos; s internal control standards still cannot be considered sufficient to provide reasonable assurances as to the legality and regularity of the transactions .
In my opinion this is one of the occasions when the institutions fortunately show their support for a new measure intended to do away with practices that might endanger the working conditions of professional drivers and safety on our roads .
Not by manufacturing , but rather by developing the wine within a culture , a tradition and a quality which represents European wines , respecting our traditions and , above all , increasing demands in order to harmonise quality upwards , and never downwards .
In fact , in my 14 years in this House , I cannot remember a time when the groups spoke before the rapporteurs on any budget report .
I believe that amongst all of us we can make an effort to find the main route to the positive development of the control of human rights within the European Union .
This was the idea that inspired the Presidency declaration on this matter , issued on 21 May .
We must defend what we have fought for tooth and nail and we must continue working ; our two representatives have given a brief summary of what has been achieved . I would like to point out , in relation to the evolutionary clauses and the new date of 2009 , that we must continue to work , drawing conclusions , creating doctrine and strengthening the European institutions .
Therefore , if she says it is not satisfactory , I must ask her whether she does not fear that there will be no common position by December 1997 , which could affect the protection of species in the first place ; if we are going to manage to arrive at a joint position by December 1997 what changes will have to be made ? Will the Commission be better organized in order to reach agreement ? And thirdly , are talks due to be held beforehand with non-government government organizations , as is usually the case ?
It is a formula for the future and I believe we should take it very seriously .
This is the basis of the amendments which Mrs Berger and I are presenting , representing the views of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
The question then arises as to how far improvement of the Commission can go without the help of control by the Member States . I should inform you that we organise seminars throughout the year .
Single-hull hull tankers must be replaced by double-hull hull ones as a matter of urgency .
The result of this is that now , the European Community is handing over to an international organisation its obligation to find a solution to its international disputes with no guarantee that it will be treated with sufficient impartiality .
On the eve of the Biarritz Summit , it is important that the Charter is approved by the Council .
Europe must maintain reciprocity in the application of the human rights clause , because we must be able to maintain a frank and open dialogue with the countries with which we have reached agreements , and we must also be able to listen to the criticisms of partner countries , in relation to how we Europeans treat their nationals , for example , and react accordingly .
But they must commit themselves - there must be an unambiguous political commitment - to meet the targets we have jointly set ourselves .
I agree that it was very positive that our positions were reaffirmed in Valencia .
the report by Mr Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the development of the relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments under the Treaty of Lisbon ,
There is the principle of the single market according to which the existence of a single currency permanently rules out the option of adjusting economies by devaluing currencies . There is the principle of a single centralised monetary policy which is managed by an independent Central Bank .
If you fail to take advantage of it , I fear that you will return here after the European Council in Nice , other presidencies will come around and this Parliament will be tempted to follow Oscar Wilde &apos; s advice , which was that the best way to avoid temptation was to fall into it , and therefore not approve the Treaty of Nice when the time comes .
Ladies and gentlemen , a little more than a year ago I explained to you the priorities for our parliamentary work .
You in the Council are not willing to negotiate and want your common position to go ahead without changing one iota .
Similarly , we want to see Russia make progress in all areas , at both the economic and commercial level and at the legal and institutional level and also in relation to respect for the great humanist principles , for human rights and for the Rule of Law , that are our badge of identity .
I must say that the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure for Malta , which took place at the last Ecofin Council on the proposal of the Commission , is a necessary condition in order for Malta to fulfil the Maastricht criterion on this point and the Commission &apos; s convergence report of 16 May said that , if the Ecofin Council approved the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure , Malta would comply .
There have been many reforms .
That is why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 9 and 10 .
. - Mr Alavanos , what you have just said is absolutely right .
And that is precisely why we need a Community Directive .
You negotiated the beginnings of peace with Matiyahu Peled in 1977 , and those agreements pointed the way towards a solution based on the co-existence existence of the two States .
Therefore , whatever the implicit or explicit requests - and I insist , implicit or explicit - of the inspectors to the members of the Security Council , I believe Europe should help them .
Secondly , a central database is very important .
Therefore , in relation to the concerns raised by Members , including Mrs Bozkurt and Mrs Vergiat , all that will be assured .
If the Iberian peninsular clearly suffers from isolation in energy terms , islands such as the Balearic Islands , where I am from , suffer a double isolation . This is very unfair for the inhabitants of these islands because we , as Europeans , have equal rights .
Finally , I must mention the more specific issues : I know that , at the moment , there are some specific initiatives with African countries , for example Mali , to set up immigration centres so that the countries of origin or transit can manage this problem themselves , in order to avoid the dramatic situation where dozens of people perish in the sea while trying to unsuccessfully reach our coasts .
Peace is a universal value which is expressed and lived by an individual according to the ethical conscience of that individual .
They can also be carried out , but , as my colleague Mr Kinnock will explain , they will require a certain amount of time .
I should point out that this subject was raised at the last meeting of the Association Council , and we have also raised it bilaterally with both the Prime Minister , Mr Nastase , and the Foreign Minister , Mr Geoana .
This is a matter that falls within the sole competence of the Commission which , as you all know , is the guardian of the Treaties
Who can assure us of this ?
Secondly , we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster , namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions .
My Group and I are going to support these amendments .
Now , one important point : the elections will be held under the Treaty of Nice but the next term of office will be administered under the Treaty of Lisbon .
It is also not a question of making progress first and later providing for the basic needs of citizens : we have learnt that education , health , social security and public services are essential in order for societies to progress .
The decision in this respect was unanimous and no one challenged it during the ratification process ; on the contrary , it was one of the provisions most welcomed by Europe &apos; s supporters .
The Finnish Presidency is not even represented here , but on the basis of the report by the House of Lords , a report for which we have great respect , I am going to ask , on behalf of the group that I coordinate , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , for an initiative report to look into the Court of Auditors &apos; methodology .
To sum up , Mr President , the Group of the European People &apos; s Party supports the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs to a very large degree . It also supports some of the amendments tabled by the Liberal Group and , on the whole , except for the amendments mentioned by Mr Hoppenstedt and myself , we will vote in favour of these amendments in general .
Thirdly , however , I would like to point out , as previous speakers have done , that this is not the end of the story .
It is also appropriate to highlight the work that is being carried out in this regard by a large number of non-governmental governmental organisations , frequently with the assistance and cooperation of the European Union .
On the subject of financial markets , and after the agreement between the Commission , the Council , and Parliament , it will be possible to comply with the deadlines to achieve an integrated stock market in 2003 , and the complete integration of the financial markets in 2005 .
I think it would , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , and I would ask him to do this .
Moroccan agriculture enjoys special treatment when exporting to Europe .
I believe that this type of behaviour towards the President of another European institution is an outrage and an affront to this House .
If globalisation makes sense in any area it is in the field of democracy , freedom , human rights and the environment , because democracy transcends nationality , just as human rights transcend colour .
I am not going to repeat the arguments that have been expressed here , with which I fully agree .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this directive is a step forward towards a common immigration policy .
I would ask you please to do everything necessary to make it possible .
I do not understand why Mr Galeote is determined to turn a European debate into a Spanish debate .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank and congratulate Mr Bourlanges on his report , not only on its content , but on his ability to accept the many amendments we have presented to him .
Mr President , the third meeting of the ASEM process will take place in Seoul in three weeks .
I feel that we need to try to distribute the available funds so as to create more support than discontent , and I feel that this is very important for the image of culture at the European level .
I therefore think that , if we analyse the operation of the area and the results that we are achieving through monetary integration , there are elements that could justify a moderately optimistic assessment .
Mr President , how can it be said that a justification in Amendment No 2 respects what the Court of Justice has said , when according to that justification , in order to explain the danger to the internal market , several Member States have indicated that , if certain measures are not adopted , they would seek to legislate ?
Mr President , the Spring Councils usually provide the setting for a debate between the Heads of State and Government on establishing the broad guidelines that will map out the path we should follow , and in the Lisbon European Council the bases were effectively established to create a Union that is close to its citizens and which is underpinned by an increasingly open and dynamic economy .
( End of fiction ) .
There are many cases that we should mention here , but please allow me to talk about at least one : that of the activist and defender of minority rights , Yaghoub Mehrnehad , an ethnic Baluchi and executive director of the &apos; Voice of Justice &apos; Youth Association , who was executed on 4 August after having publicly confronted local officials about their attitude .
These measures will have to take into account the diversity of the European agricultural industry .
Finally , Commissioner , I would like to point out , in relation to the ginning industry , that I believe was the great oversight in the 2004 reform and whose restructuring is an indisputable fact , that it is essential that a restructuring fund be created , which is mentioned in Mr Gklavakis &apos; s report .
It would be a pity for so much effort not to lead to a solution that we all want so much , or for our relations with the sovereign people of Morocco to be obstructed or clouded at a time when the new young monarchy is initiating a stage of progress that inspires hope and when relations with the European Union must play a decisive role in supporting such hope .
The States which for any reason want to set lesser objectives , will have to justify it and there are a series of criteria on which that justification will have to be based .
With respect to Amendment No 6 , I would like to remind you of the favourable acceptance by the Commission of the Parliament &apos; s report on the European Union &apos; s new perspectives in the field of the export of technology and services for the use of renewable energy when it was presented in the plenary meeting on 15 January .
The Council said in July that the thousand million paid to agriculture and other structural funds had to be reduced , but now it is showing that it does not care if cuts are made in external policy headings .
The Pacific is one of the richest fishing grounds in the world , and the European tuna fleet has been fishing in those waters for some time thanks to the bilateral agreements signed with the countries of the region .
We will not forget you .
In line with its values and principles , as well as its generosity , the European Union can become involved , by drawing up a common response that will help to solve this problem while respecting our own rules .
Do you not have any information of your own ?
I would firstly like to say that , as you all know , the task of the presidencies is essentially to promote measures , to promote reforms , to introduce initiatives and above all to shape and seek agreements which allow things to move forward , and this reflects our European tradition and also the form of the debates in the European Council .
I would like to say that at last , agreeing with these arguments , the Spanish Economic and Social Council has said that European Union agreements with non-EU EU countries lead to seven times the benefit than the cost of producing them .
I agree with all of you who said that we do not need to call on the International Monetary Fund for all of this .
As we approach the Barcelona Summit , I would ask you to not only defend our position with regard to the implications of this decision for the European business world , but also , given its importance , from the point of view of consolidating economic democracy and workers &apos; rights .
This is because there are limits on the capacity of minors to act and on their capacity to possess the right to exercise fundamental rights , about which we need information .
Accordingly , I believe that the activities of private security services do not amount to exercising official authority . It is my view that when such services act in support of the public security services they do so merely in an auxiliary capacity .
Since the creation of the Central American Common Market , few initiatives have held greater potential for accelerating economic growth in the Central American isthmus , to modernise our institutions and provide new opportunities for those Central Americans who are still living in poverty .
We really must do everything possible to ensure that , following the sham of the presidential elections , the legislative elections , which gave the opposition an acknowledged majority , enable the parliament to function .
Mr President , I will speak very briefly - firstly due to time restrictions and secondly because it would be practically impossible to respond in detail to all the speakers - but I would like to say - in response to all the Members , such as President Poettering , who have said that we will judge the Spanish Presidency on the basis of the outcome of Seville - that the Presidency does not only exist for one Council , but rather from 1 January to 30 June .
Nevertheless , we must not forget the extension of the Bank &apos; s actions over recent years .
This point is indeed missing from the report .
Despite the fact that all languages are of equal importance from a cultural point of view , it makes no sense to take the view that the European Union &apos; s institutions could operate if it were using all of them at the same level .
Gross domestic product must continue to be the main criterion , although there might be other indicators in other decision-making making processes , and the regions and local bodies must play a fundamental role .
The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters , including preventing conflicts , is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique .
I am the only person from that committee who is speaking in this debate .
My feeling is , however , that at the same time we cannot forget the need to moderate the development of wages , not to lose competitiveness and , in the case of the Eurozone , to analyse very thoroughly the reasons for , and alternatives to , the divergent development of unit labour costs between Member States of the Eurozone that can create significant problems in terms of the functioning of countries that are losing competitiveness by this means .
We have accepted the Commission &quot; s position , but we do not believe that haggling is a good sign for the future .
Mr Gerbrandy asked about the need to move forward with mutual control by both institutions on budgetary issues without a &apos; gentlemen &apos; s agreement &apos; .
Commissioner , my written question refers to the oligopoly that exists in the Spanish electricity industry .
With respect to the reference to President Napolitano , who is a former , much-loved loved colleague , there is a precedent which allows us to include the names of people , of politicians , in our texts .
We do not know if the Argentine crisis has reached its lowest point , Uruguay and Paraguay are experiencing serious difficulties and Brazil , despite considerable aid from the International Monetary Fund , is , at the very least , cause for certain doubts .
We are doing something very similar with regard to the interoperability of railways , with the objective - as I said before - of improving the efficiency of our system .
Have you or anyone from your team considered that your proposals for reforming the CFP only add to the effect of the failure of the disastrous negotiation with Morocco to renew a traditional fisheries agreement that would prevent the destruction of thousands of small-scale scale fishing jobs ?
As in all good agreements , therefore , the particular interests of the parties have been partially frustrated for the sake of the general interest , but the truth is that significant progress has been made in the area of breaks , daily and weekly breaks and weekly hours , as well as the establishment of more and stricter controls and penalties that are trans-national national .
Continuing with this subject , I would like to point out something of which we are all aware , but which there is no harm in saying : the energy situation in Europe is not exactly an optimum one .
Not only does illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing endanger biodiversity and the environment , leading to costs that in many cases may be impossible to recoup completely , but it also represents - as previous speakers have mentioned - a significant cost for many societies that currently live from fishing and that hope future generations can do likewise .
This institution has done so , with its Committee on Fisheries approving today , in a special meeting , the amounts proposed by the European Commission in the B7-800 800 line on fisheries agreements with third countries .
That is what this high-level level group was set up for : to work and prepare subsequent decisions .
Secondly , because it also talks about CO2 emissions , and rightly points out that , with the decrease in coal production CO2 emissions associated with its use have decreased , and because it states that , with the current directives on emissions , industries are obliged to ensure that their new processing plants make a more serious effort to prevent pollution and use the latest techniques available .
Her report includes measures to guarantee equal opportunities in terms of access to employment , training and professional promotion ; measures to respect women &apos; s and men &apos; s employment rights , including - and this must be emphasised - protection against sexual harassment ; and measures to enhance the reconciliation of personal and family life and employment relations .
Mr President , I am taking the floor for the last time on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party to reply to Mr Barzanti , who has just spoken on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists . I feel that I can but sum up , in one single sentence , what I believe many of us are feeling : we will miss you a great deal .
Now , the principle of incrimination and the imposition of the corresponding sanction must be established legally and , in the Commission &quot; s view , by means of the directive , which , in accordance with the Treaties in their current form , is the only genuinely effective instrument for truly incorporating sanctions into the law of all the Member States and will therefore be an effective deterrent .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , our group has been seeking a consensus with regard to the reports by our fellow Members , Mr Yañez and Mr Meyer .
In other words , we substantially agree with the position of the Commission .
From a qualitative point of view , we must take a different position : in view of the prospect of inevitable change , to help the Cuban people , to alleviate their sufferings and their needs and to hold constructive dialogue in order to prevent the change from taking the form of civil confrontation or violent confrontation but , on the contrary , to take the form of peaceful transition based on dialogue , agreement and the national independence of Cuba .
The contacts established between the three institutions , which all want the European Aviation Safety Agency to be successfully established as soon as possible , mean that we have now reached a solution which is acceptable to all .
That is to say , investment .
In this regard , I believe that the measures we should adopt should include an increase in monitoring and inspection and the clarification of quality indicators , and they should be of differing types , and , above all , it seems to me extremely important to ensure that training be established throughout the territory .
I would like to remind you that in the field of aviation we have been taking giant steps over recent years in terms of creating common areas amongst the Member States of the Union , which until now were the exclusive competence of those States .
the report by Hiltrud Breyer , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market - C6-0245 0245 / 2006 - .
Until now , it has more or less been considered that we had two processes which did not necessarily converge .
We cannot forget that the patent laws already take account of the ethical dimension and public policy before a patent is granted . In addition , we have always rejected socio-economic economic criteria when approving the release of any product onto the market .
Is this the way to further the peace process ?
Without making any prediction as to when all of the conditions for joining the euro zone may be met , I believe that over the next few years , practically every year we European institutions are going to have to give our opinion on new memberships of the zone in accordance with the Treaty , which declares the euro the official currency of the Member States of the Union .
Ladies and gentlemen , we believe that the Tenet plan , the security plan , must be supported , but who on the Palestinian side can carry out the negotiation contained in that plan ?
I wish that they were only administrative problems and the rights of these media bodies would be restored .
Madam President , before further ado I should like to express the satisfaction of my Group at the certain approval of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Chile , by this Assembly .
The final result will always be weak , because fighting death is the weak point of all of biological science .
The aim is to reduce and simplify procedures to allow this policy to be applied while retaining the specific nature of the action involved , depending on the location at which it is to be implemented .
We in the European Parliament must continue to insist on the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Mediterranean Development Bank and meanwhile , we must monitor and demand the support of the institutions involved - and in this regard I am sure we can count on the cooperation of the European Commission - in order to comply with the commitment to double the funds of the EIB in the region until 2006 .
Nor in the field of direct taxes has the opportunity been taken - as the amendment we have not wanted to repeat says - to strengthen the relationship between taxation policy and other Community policies .
A few months ago , Commissioner , this House and the Council approved the sixth framework research programme .
This is undoubtedly a point which warrants attention .
I do think it is important to highlight another significant fact : the financial agencies , for example , that have a greater proportion of women in their management bodies have suffered much less from this type of situation .
We cannot coexist in the European Union while this situation continues and , therefore , we believe it is very important that the Commission , the European Union authorities and all of us put forward proposals in the same vein to put an end to this situation .
.
But this 2 % , as an annual average , reflects a different performance .
Therefore the important issue at the moment is the method which we must follow .
Preventive censure must not be introduced .
Firstly , to protect the industry and its jobs , and secondly , to make the agreement more attractive for the industries concerned , particularly the automotive industry . Our aim was not just to avoid outright rejection , but to gain their support for the agreement .
We do not want either Parliament or the Commission to abandon people who fight peacefully to defend freedom to their fate , and nor do we want to remain silent about their suffering or about that of their families . We want to tell them from this House once again that we are still standing by them and that , despite the isolation in which they have been confined , we are not forgetting them and we are still with them in their fight , in the hope that one day Cuba can begin to move toward democracy .
It would of course be highly desirable if , as well as sharing work outside the home , we were able to share domestic chores equally with men inside the home .
As far as the method is concerned it is clear : you are looking for the final stable equilibrium in the final moments and it should be of concern to those citizens that their governmental representatives are incapable of establishing the rules of the game and a code of confidence for taking such vital decisions .
And combating this enemy , which has many tentacles and which kills in a merciless and brutal manner , does not involve a normal war , it is not a traditional war , but it is - and there is not the least doubt of this - an unequal and criminal war against societies built upon principles such as freedom and democracy .
The European Union must therefore use every means within its power , not only in order to help fund the peace process , but also , above all , in order to make it possible to establish living conditions that make peace irreversible .
I believe that it will have significant repercussions , which have been listed by previous speakers .
Mr President , I would more or less follow on from Mrs Fraga &quot; s last sentence .
Finally , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , last week in Geneva I had the opportunity to meet Mrs Lehtomäki , Minister for External Trade and Development , at the negotiations of the Doha Development Round .
Furthermore , I have just heard a completely uncalled-for for comment which assumes that a Member State &apos; s hydrological plan - which has not yet been implemented , which is at a stage of open planning , and which is still subject to new suggestions and development - violates a framework directive .
The general view is that the media in the Member States believe that what happens here is not newsworthy or is not generally of interest to the citizens .
Firstly , because the economic contribution we requested has been reduced by the Council of Ministers from EUR 115 million to EUR 75 million , a reduction which we believe is going to prevent us from achieving the objective of transferring the expected total annual increase in international goods transport by road to other alternative modes of transport , and this increase is expected to be in the order of 50 % up until 2010 .
If we had to summarise in one pillar what it is that is going to enable Europe , and all the countries that make up Europe , to be competitive in this global world , it is the qualifications of the human resources , the citizens of Europe .
The European citizens and we in Parliament , their legitimate representatives , must collectively commit ourselves to never again allowing an opportunity to be missed .
Does the money exist ?
These are actions that the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats strongly condemns and which the European Parliament should also condemn . At the same time , it should also demand the immediate and unconditional release of the soldiers who are being held hostage and show its support for the Government of Sierra Leone , and for the UNAMSIL and British army forces who are working to consolidate peace in that country .
Allow me first of all to welcome the fact that there is virtual unanimity between the Council , the Commission and , hopefully , the Parliament , concerning such a crucial issue at a time when we have to take decisive steps in the development of the common foreign and security policy .
That is the Transparency Initiative , which this Parliament supports wholeheartedly . This own-initiative initiative report we are submitting says two things .
Why did the Lisbon Strategy fail ?
I believe that all these points are very interesting and worthy of our attention and they deserve to be highlighted in this report .
It is an important date for the PPE-DE DE and also for democracy in Europe .
Whatever the result is , we will continue working once again and I will continue to count on your support , as I do generally in relation to all the initiatives I present .
Furthermore , I am sure that you will find a viable route in the direction indicated .
For this reason , we are working and wish to continue working to protect Europe &apos; s security through all organisations and specifically through the United Nations .
This therefore gives us a clear - and I would say urgent - reason to act .
Amendment No 13 cannot be endorsed , because it would oblige all airports to apply a system of noise taxes and Amendments Nos 18 , 19 and 20 are not only ruled out because the inclusion or reference to harmonised European objectives is outside the scope of this proposal , but also because they are completely incompatible with the method proposed for the calculation of charges on noise emissions .
Furthermore , the enlargement process cannot carry on indefinitely ; I therefore also agree with the Commission &apos; s idea of consolidation .
The price is actually exorbitant if it is also taken into account that at least EUR 14 million is not linked in any way to payment for fishing opportunities or the development of the fisheries sector .
The third group is made up of the middlemen , who have a range of differing interests .
So after that positive assessment , I want to go beyond the actual distribution of this year &apos; s quotas and seek to evaluate the whole distribution system itself .
Mr President , Madam Vice-President President , ladies and gentlemen , at the beginning of this new parliamentary session we are dealing with one of the issues which I would describe as a star issue for this legislature .
In view of the outcome of the world discussions on climate change in the December Copenhagen meeting , would the Council agree that , while European agriculture is a contributory factor in the production of CO2 emissions , the devastation of the tropical rainforests in the Amazon basin more than outweighs the negative effects of European agricultural production in terms of CO2 emissions ?
The President-in in-Office Office of the Council has congratulated the European Central Bank and its staff .
The explosion of China , which has been direct and immense in the case of production , will be even more so in the case of consumption and also in distribution at world level , becoming one of the main determining factors of both elements .
In addition , I would like to denounce categorically the trade in weapons and ammunition with organised bands and paramilitary factions .
I would like to end by thanking all of the shadow rapporteurs and all of the Members whose proposals have enriched this report , which I hope you will support .
As has been said , this is about combating a type of social terrorism , which is chauvinist violence .
As regards the convention , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , I should like to point out that we are aware of how important the way in which we deal with immigration is in terms of our relations with third countries . I should like to make three comments in this regard .
Paraguay was probably the only country in the world whose population had been practically exterminated during wars with its two neighbours , Argentina and Brazil .
To that end , we must create a dialogue that includes the administration and the social and economic actors and that takes account of the available research and innovation instruments .
Good handling of macroeconomic policy is allowing us to achieve good results .
The sector produces a surplus and Community protection is minimal .
Faced with this situation , I think the first thing to emphasize is the need for coordination in that region between all the authorities concerned , including those with responsibility for industry and mines - the precise cause of the catastrophe was the storage of waste water from mineral purification - as well as those directly responsible for the protection of the nature reserve .
Through his own concrete achievements , in particular as the first President of the High Authority of the ECSC and , above all , as the constant and determined inspiration for the subsequent development of European integration .
Certain countries , such as Italy , have already put forward imaginative proposals along these lines .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to congratulate our colleague Mrs De Sarnez on her excellent work on an issue of such great importance to all Europeans .
New international organisations and fora have emerged - an example is the summit diplomacy of the G20 , G8 , G7 , etc . - and there are proposals to reform the traditional international organisations .
A great many things have been said , all very interesting .
. We are giving our opinion today on a motion for a resolution on the crisis in the Middle East , demonstrating that , unlike the European Council , Parliament is reacting properly to the situation .
And from that swarm of interests , planning should emerge as a policy to restore the balance of European spatial areas and policies .
This is not reasonable .
In this battle , what we need to achieve is legislation that guarantees citizens &apos; rights in relation to the care they should receive - benefits and safety - rather than just the right that they already have to mobility between Member States .
Secondly , I would also like to stress the financial aspects of fisheries agreements in general , this specific case being one very infamous example .
Mr President , thank you for allowing me to speak on a personal note .
Just on the issue of interoperability , everyone knows that , in July 1996 , in other words 11 years ago , we adopted Council Directive 96 / 48 / EC on the high-speed speed rail system followed , in March 2001 , by the Directive on the trans-European European conventional rail system .
The CAP aid schemes needed simplifying .
We would therefore call upon the Commission , by means of the European Gender Equality Institute , to find a rapid solution to this issue .
Therefore , we think that these amendments should not be included , because they would cause some confusion .
Mrs Thyssen held up a bar of chocolate and described how clearly indicating whether or not it contained vegetable fats would help consumers to decide whether or no to buy it .
However , the amendment has not been correctly translated into Spanish since , where it talks about the peripheral regions , I wished to refer , and I in fact did refer , to the outermost regions of the European Union .
Enlargement is going to take place - now we know it .
There are no majorities here .
Also , the Member States must promote a commitment to rejecting any form of violence among their young people .
There is one point we must grasp , which is that as long as Milosevic is in power there will be no peace , just as there would never have been peace in Germany had Hitler been allowed to continue in power !
The Common Position reflects this desire to send a message of progress and looking forward rather than rigidity .
I hope that Mr McCreevy will do everything he can to ensure that this Parliament &apos; s will in this regard is implemented .
We are going to place value on the need to defend the freedom and fundamental rights of citizens .
After analysing what I saw , read and heard during my stay in the Republic of the United Mexican States , I came to the same conclusion as Mrs Ferrer , author of the report we are debating today , and I congratulate her publicly . This is the best agreement the European Union has yet signed to promote trade and investment and it will benefit both parties .
Many sources in the United States say that Europe must not get involved given their previous experience .
A proportion of their catches is not landed and they do not generate local employment , as the Community fleet did .
Europe is the best instrument available to us in the 21st century , as the Lisbon Strategy stated from the outset , for making economic dynamism compatible with social cohesion and solidarity with future generations in terms of sustainability , with the elderly , with the environment and with future generations .
But I believe that it would be a mistake at the moment for us to tell the Commission what the conditions for the negotiations should be .
No , we are going to judge it on the mandate of the Nice Conference , which is the same as it was in Finland plus enhanced cooperation .
We do not know what the judgment will be , nor what the jurisdiction or tools will be .
Our differences lie in how and from when , if I have understood correctly .
The situation of women in these regions cannot be compared to those of women in Denmark or the other Nordic countries , where &apos; machismo &apos; is less pronounced .
Employment is a priority objective of the European Union and it is not enough just to create it . We also have to prevent its destruction .
I believe that this would actually be enough to solve the problem raised by the question by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
Because the problem we face is whether , as a consequence of the directive being adopted , European businesses - as Mr Lehne pointed out - could be held to ransom by the major international financial operators , who are known colloquially as the &apos; Sharks of Wall Street &apos; .
Today , Chile is a mature country , a country which looks towards three continents from an economic point of view , and therefore it is very important that we should strengthen our economic ties with Chile .
Mr President , I am grateful to Mrs Yade for being present at this debate on a subject that causes citizens so much concern .
The execution of the great projects of the Trans-European European Transport Network also suffers from a lack of funds .
I would like to mention two other aspects of this directive that I think represent progress . First , it requires much more transparency from governments .
We should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the European delegation on their vigorous defence of our positions .
I would like to stress that the document for this year is of a more strategic nature than usual , insofar as it is a document which intends to define the broad European strategy for the next three years .
UCLAF must ensure that it leads the way in the transition from the current system to becoming a true officer of the court with an enhanced group of criminal experts .
It is not an easy task - none of the seven proposals in the package are - and it is not easy for everybody to accept , since we are talking about financial guarantees and responsibilities of shipowners and it is quite legitimate for that sector to try to water down that responsibility or postpone decisions with which compliance is obligatory .
I would like to know , Mrs Schreyer , what is going to be done with the initial proposal for revision of the financial perspective .
And that message must be a message of safety : that the safety and information requirements for these products have been improved .
The aim was to promote sustainable development and strengthen job-creating creating production sectors .
The necessary global investment for these projects , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , will amount to more than EUR 66 000 million which must clearly be financed essentially through national , regional , private , public and also , where necessary , Community funds .
We should ask ourselves exactly how being awarded the Sakharov Prize has helped her and her other colleague Leyla Zana - who will be mentioned later- , who continues to be held prisoner in Turkish prisons , after having received a further sentence of two years for writing an article .
This is why we maintain that mere declarations of intent will not help to bring about the Europe of sustainable development .
I also want to highlight a major change that has taken place in the IMO , which up to now was practically immovable .
The reason is that we have decided to create an economic and monetary union , which is under construction but is not yet complete .
We started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme , and today we can say with a degree of pride that , although the path has not been easy , as many people have frequently failed to understand the order , and doubted its effectiveness and clarity , we have achieved it .
The results , however , should be the same .
That is to say , fight fraud , corruption and any illegal activity which harms our Community .
Thank you , Mr Reinfeldt ; thank you , Cecilia .
Madam President , I wanted to take the floor in order to expand on your comments at the beginning of the sitting , and to point out that the latest fatal victim of ETA &apos; s barbarity , the Basque policeman Iñaki Totorika , belonged to the Basque Nationalist Party , the majority political force in the Basque Country .
This is the lesson which we must teach the young people of today : the events of the past and the progress of the present , without hiding the crimes and mistakes which had to be overcome and pointing out the sacrifices entailed in overcoming them .
In summary , Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that the objective must be for us to be in a position to conclude this ambitious strategic association agreement between the European Union and its Member States and the Andean Community and its Member States at the Fifth European Union-Latin Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Lima in 2008 .
We must ensure that , through the modification of this regulation , a rapid and effective response can be given to those disasters which the Member States are unable to tackle on their own , by extending the current eligibility to industrial disasters , acts of terrorism and public health emergencies , not forgetting such an important issue as the severe droughts which are occurring increasingly often , particularly in certain Mediterranean areas .
Our potential for renewable energies in the European Union is limited , both for physical reasons - because , apart from solar power , where we could have a greater margin , the others have clear limitations - and for economic reasons , because it is true that we have to grant aid to the renewable energies - and I have already said that I have taken concrete , positive initiatives in this respect - but even so , we have to maintain some level of competitiveness and balance .
In the interests of providing continuity regarding financial decisions , financial perspectives should cover the five-year year term of Parliament and the Commission .
In the field of democracy and respect for human rights we are also very far from the desirable parameters : coups d &apos; états , violence , wars and violations of human rights are still realities in the least-developed developed countries . We must therefore contribute to correcting this situation .
Tomorrow , the Socialist Group will support the Andersson report and the work of the Commission because we believe that in fact the changes proposed are not frivolous , or opportunistic , but that they respond to our social commitment to this generation of workers , to these citizens , and also to those who will live in Europe in the next generation .
I think the suggestion about Objective 3 is very important , especially in view of the EU &apos; s biggest problem at the moment - unemployment .
And I believe that all of you , as regular air passengers , know exactly what we are talking about .
The existence of the euro zone has also significantly contributed to this favourable climate , thanks to the good finance conditions for families and businesses provided by the current level of interest rates and also thanks to the protection the euro has provided against the turbulence of the financial markets , as occurred in the spring .
I represent my nation and I am also a citizen of the Spanish State and of the Union , and there is no contradiction here .
Mr President , in the 45 years of application of the Euratom Treaty , its capacity for adaptation and flexibility in order to respond to the needs and concerns of any particular moment has been demonstrated .
Those problems are still there .
This substance , which is used as an agricultural disinfectant mainly in clearly defined farming zones in the Mediterranean regions is already strictly limited in my country in terms of its marketing and use and has already been replaced in all cases for which suitable alternatives have been found .
That is what we must seek .
There are only a few resources and , as you have often said yourself , they have to be divided between many actors , and this process of dilution reduces effectiveness .
The next item is the debate on the statement by the Vice-President President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , Mrs Ashton , on the situation in Syria , Bahrain and Yemen .
As some honourable Members have said , lack of safety leads to 40 000 deaths and 1 750 000 injuries per year in the European Union .
Showing the utmost warmth and friendship at all times - as befits loyal colleagues - the United States has been relentless in the banana panel and the hormone panel . Let us not be naive .
As a result , the best calling card at next spring &apos; s summit of Heads of State or Government in Madrid , between the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean , would be to repeal this &apos; Directive of Shame &apos; , which does not comply with our principles and values and which is not understood by any government , particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean , from where thousands of migrant workers come to the European Union .
On the other hand , our group has no particular reasons to disagree with the Council on this Budget .
All these issues relating to the labour market must inspire the review of the Luxembourg process and give impetus to the adoption of the necessary structural reforms of the labour markets in each of the countries of the European Union .
Nos 37 and 38 did not receive an answer either in accordance with the Rules , and their authors were also present .
Mr President , during the last mini-part part-session session here in Brussels we had about twenty councillors from the Basque country with us , and we had the opportunity of expressing our solidarity with them in their constant dedication to the fight for freedom and democracy .
Furthermore , we believe that that is where a genuine and indigenous scheme also can be found for establishing the pillars for future development .
This House has always led the way on the issue of European integration and I am sure that it wants Europe to work .
In addition , the Commission &apos; s Communication regarding the means to reinforce Kosovo &apos; s political and socio-economic economic development has been welcomed .
Mr Aznar , we must construct an area of freedom , justice and security for the citizens , while fully respecting the democratic traditions of our countries and the fundamental human rights embodied in our Charter .
I would like to end by saying that I am pleased with the text since it represents an important step forward towards a closer Union amongst the European citizens , as well as being very good news in terms of improving education within the Union .
There are certain geographic conditions - I am thinking , for example , of Strasbourg airport , where there is a problem of boxing-in in between mountains and phenomena of echoes are produced which aggravate noise problems - and other issues which justify the adaptations and specific measures for protection of these areas .
It is therefore true that Mrs Fourtou has had to make certain efforts to reach agreement and that the proposal we are voting on today in this Parliament is not exactly the same as the one voted for in committee .
In March this very year , the European Council set a target for a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption , whereas in reality we have proved incapable of attaining the much more modest targets to which we committed ourselves in Kyoto .
Here today , in the European Parliament , we are asking for this Fund to be mobilised as a matter of urgency in order to help Galicia .
That difference in momentum between the two plans had consequences which many of us regret to this day and which I personally regret .
I would like to put this question to the Council , and also , and above all , to the Commission .
2001 was a year of transition which was marked by significant progress , especially in the fields of financial management and internal control .
I refer , for instance , to the Mediterranean or Central Asia .
As coordinator , I am convinced that , with everyone &apos; s cooperation , Parliament will help to find solutions to these new challenges : solutions that maintain a balance between economic , social and environmental issues in order to move towards a greener , more intelligent Europe with greater social cohesion .
It is not a question of creating a great market , because in a great market the Gresham law would end up being applied , according to which bad money takes the place of good money .
They have vast energy needs .
Let me stress once more , ladies and gentlemen , that if such a report does emerge you will be made aware of it immediately .
I cannot end my speech without congratulating Commissioner Michel on his actions in the area and for starting a political dialogue . This dialogue must continue but it must also be made clear that we will be very firm : firm in defending human rights and firm towards the outrages being committed through the adoption of laws in relation to NGOs .
This is an historical step which should not make us forget those people who are still deprived , as Oswaldo Payá puts it , of the right to rights .
I therefore think it important that the European Parliament is today flying the flag of citizenship in the splendid presentation we have heard from the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and rapporteur .
This is not an isolated incident , but rather the culmination of persecutions of and attacks on Christians in majority Muslim countries .
I am sure that we are all now united in our vigorous and forthright defence of freedom in Europe , but I wish to say that , more than the solidarity of the Members of the European Parliament , we in Spain need their commitment .
I think that Mr Szájer has done a good job , that in Parliament we have tried to act with a sense of responsibility , that we are going to continue doing so and that the only thing that is going to remain for us to do is this part , which is conveying to citizens what we are really doing here , and this is quite difficult .
Of course , from now on , the Amsterdam Treaty presents us with a challenge : incorporating into the acquis communautaire that which up until now has been , as I said , the frontier territory of the third pillar , in particular the free movement of persons .
I would ask the European Commission , the Commissioner and all of the political groups in Parliament to be responsible when voting and to take into account that , without agriculture , sustainable development is not possible .
The position achieved by the euro in the international markets brings undoubted benefits , such as better protection from external shocks .
Mr President , we are currently facing a major fisheries crisis in the whole of the European Union , which is going to demand a rapid response from the European institutions .
We have achieved a step forward that is necessary but not enough : we must make further progress and protect the most vulnerable members of the public .
Despite all its problems , Europe is characterised by great creation .
We are amazed , let me repeat , that they should be so surprised .
It was announced on Israeli radio yesterday that Al Fatah and Hamas will meet next week in Cairo to negotiate an end to suicide attacks in Israel by Hamas .
Secondly , so far there has been no damage within the reserve , and the damage caused to the ecosystem is not yet irreparable .
Its success depended largely on the concept thriving that the environment can and should be part of business strategies as another factor which , as well as environmental safety , provides added value for the business itself .
Finally , once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed , we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment , as proposed by the Commission with the support of this House . In this strategy , young people and women , training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention .
Finally , in 1998 the Commission obtained certain data , opinions and experiences and , on that basis , has produced the report which we are discussing today .
The European industry needs more time to apply the proposed measures . I therefore ask that the Commission , in cooperation with the manufacturers , evaluate the applicability and the cost-efficiency efficiency relationship of these measures and essentially of the periods proposed , as we run the risk of indirectly favouring the large companies in the sector , which are precisely not the European ones .
Mr President , I wish to direct my comments to Mr Barroso .
We are also participating in eight other panels .
The only difference is that they received him in secret and not in the transparency which we have always tried to apply to our own external policies .
However , I must add that integration forms part of the policy of the European immigration pact , integration in respect of the human rights of immigrants .
To solve the problem of the high level of undischarged transit operations , we should emphasise the importance of operational measures and , again , the need for swift development of this new system .
I must reiterate them today , as we discuss the case of the Prestige which sunk off Spain , off the coast of Galicia to be precise .
It is also important that the preferences cover more products and , above all , that a significant number of products currently considered sensitive be transferred to the non-sensitive sensitive category .
These networks fall within the framework of the general objective of social and economic cohesion .
The same applies to commercial and association agreements .
Do not worry , Mr President , I am not going to exercise my right to reply to personal references .
Furthermore , we support a scientific policy and feel that the function of the Popular Party and of Parliament , in this case , is to support the Council and the Commission because codecision is not only Parliament &apos; s right , but also a responsibility that should be used to help governments .
We have the example of the European Energy Charter , which was inspired by special circumstances , in Eastern Europe . Now we have another set of special circumstances : moving from the potential to the actual , and turning the new challenge presented by renewable energy into valid legal documents .
As one Member has said , there is a paradox here , and that is that sometimes the worst type of disinformation results from an overload of information .
The credibility of NATO and of what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan .
It would be null and void .
We said as much on 14 June when we told President Aznar that he was failing to defend the interests of Spain and that he was damaging Spain &apos; s representation with this attitude .
The first step consists of severing the link between economic growth and the intense use of resources and unwanted effects such as pollution .
Secondly , because of the role that these parties will play in the future .
If we consider that this figure equates to twice the cost of the Commission &apos; s proposed economic recovery plan , the size of the sum involved can be appreciated .
When these infringements take place but are not known about other than on a personal level , it is simply impossible for us to pursue them .
It is important , and I will conclude with this , to ask the Commission for the human rights action plan to be concluded quickly and ambitiously , Madam President .
The Commissioner confirms our suspicions that Commissioner Fischler is hiding things from us and hiding himself as well . I am not surprised that he left the chamber hardly ten minutes ago because this proposal is shameful .
In recent days , I have read how an operator such as SNCB in Brussels proposed to offer car drivers traffic information in real time in order to help them take intermodal decisions sufficiently in advance .
In summary , the task must not be to restate the identity of Europe over and over again , but to seek , define and consolidate the bases on which the Europeans can identify with each other .
I believe that their presence is without doubt something which will allow us to believe that the Basque people can regain its capacity for dialogue and can return to peace .
Will the regulations be improved ?
Let there be no mistake : if the countries from which immigration originates do not put their house in order , the problem will continue .
However , it is not so common to hear people speak of what Europe &apos; s role should be in this context of the information society , globalisation and technology .
At the same time we wish to draw attention to education .
This is why we must work alongside countries of origin and transit towards true mobility for a workforce with rights and obligations , not a workforce of slaves .
Perhaps , however , the most novel contributions have been , firstly , power-sharing sharing measures : this could , for example , produce a balanced number of women and men on company boards and in all decision-making making posts in line with the new law introduced in my country , Spain .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , once again we are debating a subject which keeps appearing on our agenda in this assembly : the creation of employment and stimulating the activity of SMEs .
Madam President , democracy and defending human rights have an important place among the Union &apos; s principles and objectives for external action - I refer to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union .
In my view , the critical assessment and concern detailed in this report constitute a timely warning . We should heed it .
We continue to believe that the Council needs to have instruments in order to defend human rights , in order to respond to situations of serious human rights violations , either through a specific country mandate - which is the case of Burma or the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea - or through mandates on specific subjects within a country , as we hope will be the case for the Democratic Republic of Congo .
on behalf of the PPE-DE DE Group . - Mr President , I wish to direct my comments at the Minister in particular because I believe that her intellectual capacity will allow her to understand that this is a completely new issue .
Nevertheless , in contrast to the hope represented by Gaza , we fear that the current Israeli policy in Jerusalem may slam shut the so-called called window of opportunity just at the most sensitive and volatile point of the conflict .
The Council intends to resolve the matter by cutting a good proportion of the aid to Russia and the Mediterranean area with the rest coming from proportionate reductions in the other external programmes .
We therefore deeply regret the disappearance of the first proposal from the text , in which Mr Prodi asked for the Directive on land to be unblocked in the Council .
It would probably have been useful , in studies carried out prior to the Urban plan being set in motion , for this other type of consequence to have been taken into account .
The fishing authorities have not only assessed these consequences but in addition intensify them with agreements of this type .
rapporteur . - Mr President , the directive referred to in the report is an amended version of a 1978 directive on the same subject , prepared in the light of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the case-law law developed by the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the new social realities . It is a version that incorporates key elements of the improvement in women &apos; s rights , which are those assessed in this report .
We should also pay close attention to the thoughts of Cándido Méndez , one of the principle figures in the Spanish agreement , who attended the meeting of the Economic and Social Council on Tuesday , 8 February in Brussels .
There are social consequences in relation to safety in the road transport sector , and I believe we must deal with them .
I will begin with the first point : the situation in Iraq .
The European Union is even considered to be the world leader in protecting the environment .
It is a threat we have to face in addition to the threat from the nationalist terrorism of ETA , which is weaker than ever , it is true , but which still has the capacity to kill .
Furthermore , the technology is available to use the very mechanisms offered by the new information and communication technologies to hinder access by those people investigating the crime to the information point likely to be engaged in illegal acts .
Our legislation must also respect another type of balance which is equally essential : the balance between the three institutions that are considered in the Treaty of Amsterdam . This does not mean that it would not be appropriate for the other institutions also to adopt the regulation when we adopt it .
A basic point for us in the process is the way in which we seek to maintain the present institutional balance .
I think that the Commission should provide a text that is correct , tell us which of the texts is the final version , and make this available in all of the official languages .
In any event , I take note of your comments , which will appear in the Minutes , and I regret that a newspaper from any country can make statements on written or oral replies which are yet to be given .
On the basis of this analysis , it moves on to a second chapter which addresses what must , in our opinion , be the main strategic objectives for Europe &apos; s security .
Parliament therefore applauds the Commission &apos; s initiative in proposing a legal framework and the conditions for it .
The Commission sometimes gives the impression that it wants to forget the conclusions of the Luxembourg Council of October 1997 on the policy of fisheries agreements with third countries , which explicitly recognised the socio-economic economic advantages of those agreements for the Community , both in terms of the supply of raw materials and employment , and which are - and will continue to be - an essential element of the common fisheries policy .
Our horror is at the repeated scenes of murdered children and women heartbroken in their endless suffering following the bombing of the ghetto that Gaza has become .
That is why we are working in that direction .
Finally , I believe , and I will end here , Mr President , that the involvement of the sector must be the third essential requirement for the success of the proposals on the recovery of stocks .
Today I have found out that a council of war sentenced the person who killed this aid worker to thirty years in prison and has awarded compensation of EUR 40 000 to the family of the victim .
We are furthermore now examining this proposal for the third pillar .
We are demanding that they be simplified as soon as possible .
This is something we have discussed on more than one occasion in this House .
( Applause from the Greens / EFA Group )
The intention is to associate the citizens with the process of European integration , giving them more involvement , strengthening the protection of their rights and promoting the idea of a European identity by means of the creation of a sense of belonging amongst the citizens of the Union .
This matter therefore merits serious treatment and my group would also like to call for this matter to be discussed at the next plenary in July , together with the respective statements by the Council and the Commission .
My group has decided to distinguish between the scientific and technical nature of the report and the political nature of the conflict , while condemning the attitude of the Sharon Government which - with its policy of indiscriminate killings , with the construction of a wall which steals even more Palestinian territory and its failure to evacuate settlements - is blocking the Quartet &apos; s roadmap and making it increasingly difficult to establish a viable Palestinian State .
The competent services had informed me that the order of interventions would be as follows : firstly the four rapporteurs of the reports , and then the Commissioner would be given the floor to make the aforementioned statement .
Finally , I would like to stress the fact that the Commission still intends - as the report that you have presented to us states - to use the degree of use of the financial credits allocated in the annual budget as the main gauge of the success of their financial management .
This is unacceptable , to the extent that it means , in practice , postponing the elimination of controls at internal frontiers - in other words , maintaining surreptitiously precisely that which we are purporting to abolish .
Furthermore , this Regulation lays down obligatory minimum requirements and there is always the possibility of voluntary optional labelling .
Many different types of direct local action for employment , with an immediate impact , are also possible , naturally with the support of the European programmes .
But I would try , first of all , to take this step forward , making the position more flexible with the possibility of revising it .
Furthermore , we are asking that it be extended to other countries of the south .
Last Ramadan indeed resulted in an escalation of violence and terror .
Madam President , you have said several times that this is a very serious problem .
However , the most important thing to realise is that the G20 initiative is not an event but rather a process .
I hope that this can be improved in the future . For the time being , my vote is in favour , though I do not consider the text to be entirely satisfactory .
One of the main factors which has inspired this revision has been the increase over the last 17 years in the number of services offered by private companies .
However , the self-imposed imposed deadline of 22 January for the closure of Guantánamo has passed and there are still 192 prisoners .
It also does not work for pelagic species , and we also now know that other factors influence the status of populations , such as errors in recruitment or environmental factors , which may result in incorrect definitions of maximum sustainable yield .
We have fulfilled the road map and this has allowed the Commission and the Council to bring all 30 chapters with the first ten Laeken countries to the table ; the negotiations have entered the final straight .
For a long time things have been left , for a long time things have not been done and now it is we who are doing things .
This Parliament will play no part in it .
In this document entitled &apos; Better Lawmaking &apos; there are barely two paragraphs on subsidiarity .
Like Mrs Maes , we are perplexed at the paradoxical behaviour , in which we see how , since the creation of the European Union , millions of euros of aid have been approved for countries that are clearly involved in the military occupation of one or other of their neighbours .
Admirable attempts at recovery are being made , however .
As this is a transposition into EU legislation of recommendations issued by a regional fisheries organisation , the North-East East Atlantic Fisheries Commission ( NEAFC ) in this case , but which will be followed by many others , Parliament &apos; s objective was fundamentally to establish a mechanism which would enable the transpositions to take place as quickly as possible , preventing internal bureaucratic delays from preventing us from responding correctly to our international obligations , as has been the case so far .
In conclusion , I would like to stress that it is very important that we make consumers aware that thanks to the legislation on additives and the work of the Scientific Committee on Food they can enjoy adequate food safety and food products which are suited to their needs .
Community preference is being deteriorated and I should like to recall that this is a basic principle of the CAP .
The only problem is that what is required - and I hope that at some point we will obtain it - is not only negotiations but also the confirmation that the preliminary agreements reached with the particular negotiator on duty receive the backing of the United States administration .
In this context , the Commission is taking action and we have specific projects for each of those three areas .
These programmes , which naturally the European Commission , Parliament and Council must be involved in , must have , firstly , the relevant legal basis , and that is moving in the right direction and , secondly , an adequate budget .
Mr President , I would first of all like to join with previous speakers in warmly and sincerely congratulating the rapporteur on this complete , systematic and , if I may use the term , pedagogical work on an issue which , apparently , everybody knows about , although this is not always the case .
First of all I would like to say that there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding what the impact could be of eliminating the quota system in the various producing regions .
This week , during our visit to Russia for the European Union / Russia Summit , as part of the Association and Cooperation agreement , we have the firm intention of pointing out that in order for the International Maritime Organisation to adopt the amendment of the MARPOL Convention , which includes an accelerated phasing out of single-hulled hulled vessels by April 2005 , Russia has undertaken to provide for early phasing out and therefore to require that it be carried out .
I think that it would be a good idea for us to state also , with a view to future negotiations with Turkey , what our majority stance is .
With regard to the situation in Cuba , on another delegation visit , I think we all will agree that the situation of that country is extremely gloomy .
The fact that these same problems are being repeated calls into question once again the reliability of the budgetary forecasts .
The company Sintel , which is a subsidiary of Telefónica , is in a very serious situation in which its 2 000 workers are currently shut in or camped out in the open air in particularly harsh conditions , demanding a fair solution in relation to their jobs .
I frankly believe not ; that is not the way forward .
Three years have passed since we held a ministerial meeting with our ASEAN partners , which is far too long a time in our relations with a region that is important for the European Union from the political and economic points of view .
However , as I come from a small region with small farms that have huge problems , and where there have been some , but very few , cases of BSE , I would like to highlight three issues that I think are fundamental .
I would like to point out that not all women in rural areas live in the same way .
In Spain , in Article 13 ( 2 ) of the Constitution , and the reciprocity principle laid down in the friendship and cooperation treaties with Chile , Venezuela , Argentina and Uruguay .
In paragraph four of the Resolution there is a phrase missing , literally &apos; which should be compatible with European Union doctrine on cooperation , respect for human rights and democracy &apos; .
I was a representative of this Parliament at the Rio Conference , where all the Heads of State and of Government promised to take respectful and responsible measures . Nevertheless , these precautionary measures are not being adhered to .
As a final comment , the proposals for directives make the right to free movement contingent upon preconditions which do not appear in the Treaty , although the abolition of controls is a clear and unconditional obligation on the part of the Union .
With regard to paragraph 7 of your Resolution , I would like to point out that in October the Commission proposed to the Government of Equatorial Guinea that a mission should be conducted to evaluate the overall application of activities associated with consolidating the rule of law and promoting and respecting human rights , as laid down in the cooperation programme .
Let us do it , perhaps less passionately than during the referendum campaigns , but with more and better information .
There are those that think that politics is the art of the possible .
Can the Commission prove that juvenile fish are being caught with regulation-mesh mesh nets ?
It is not therefore appropriate to exempt integrated generators from the payment of certain charges in a general way , rather than by case-by by-case case treatment .
I do not understand .
Mr President , Commissioner , as you know , I live in Bilbao , a city in the Basque country which , like other European cities , is very densely populated .
The political and economic aspects are out of balance , and the terms undoubtedly need to be changed .
We must put into practice the principles and actions proposed in this own-initiative initiative report so as to make rural life more attractive to young people , thus preventing depopulation of the countryside .
Mr President , the defenders of the interests of the multinationals in this Parliament have not studied the subject of bananas properly .
The subject matter was not controversial and there were no amendments during the plenary session that could subvert the report &apos; s basic content .
Therefore , Mr President-in in-Office Office of the Council , I pray that in the Feira conclusions , which we will all read with enormous interest , the Charter will receive the boost that it deserves , so that the Convention will be able to complete its work properly .
I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur and I applaud the teamwork we have achieved .
The insistence with which the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the Council of Europe , several Member States and an ample majority of the Members of this Parliament have voiced their concerns is justified by the fact that the most basic principles of our European project are at stake .
All the past problems have been resolved , which we are very pleased about .
Will this agreement make the fight against organised crime more effective ?
Those are our principal amendments .
Therefore , the provisional agreement which , as I have said , the Council agreed last year , will in any case will become invalid , unless this European Parliament takes a prior decision , in 2010 .
As has already been said , we are starting from a situation in which there is complete divergence between the laws of the various Member States , where in reality the concept of copyright , the whole gamut of obligations and rights which this concept is represented by in our different laws , is not even similar .
The aim is to avoid a third reading , put an end to the current intolerable legal vacuum and provide significant political impetus to our development cooperation with South Africa .
Commissioner , how many times must we in Parliament repeat that the nut sector requires a definitive solution ? How many times must we request that , until the reform of the market in the form of aid per hectare takes place , the improvement plans for the nut sector , which are crucial to preserving rural life in some very underdeveloped areas , which have no real alternatives , be extended ?
Ladies and gentlemen , it would be horrendous , to give an example , if an Objective 1 region , with the highest unemployment rate in the European Union , which also suffers the consequences of the competition created by the very favourable agreements which we , Europeans , have granted to Morocco in the fruit products sector , not only suffered the effects of a tough conversion as a result of the lack of an agreement with Morocco , but that , furthermore , as a result of the budgetary miserliness of certain people , it also ended up without Structural Funds .
Starting in the summer , the severe economic slowdown - and now recession , in many cases - in major economies throughout the euro area and in the United States and Japan caused an extremely acute negative shock in demand , which can also be seen happening in emerging countries like China , India and others . Raw material prices have now plummeted , so that a barrel of oil must now cost around USD 43 or 45 , but the same pattern of a very sharp fall can be seen in the price trends of many other raw materials .
I believe that one of the main issues in the debate on the Convention will be how to control subsidiarity , for , as the rapporteur has very clearly stated , the great majority of competences are competences shared between the Union and the Member States .
We wish the Yemeni Delegation fruitful meetings and an excellent stay in Strasbourg .
A year on , however , and the barbarism of the terrorists is continuing .
Let us hope that there will be no need to mobilise any more than the sum currently available in the emergency reserve during the last few months of 2005 .
The nominal objectives are linked to certain assumptions on growth .
This is what actually happens under the present system of own resources .
Having said that , Mr President , it only remains for me to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Post , who has had the difficult job of continuing with a report that was begun by another Member , Mr Maat , and who has done a tremendous job .
We cannot allow the radicals in Spain - in El Ejido - in Italy , Germany or Austria to take the initiative in this field .
There are certain recommendations in Mr Lauk &apos; s report that I would like to stress , and I shall add a few of my own .
He was introduced to politics by another councillor , José Luis Caso , whose death we noted with sorrow in this Parliament only a few months ago .
Mr President , in Lisbon , a common horizon was set , establishing structural reforms for the modernisation of our economy , in order to increase growth and employment .
But although I agree with all that , and also the transnational dimension of the elections - although I know public opinion is against that in some countries - I have to say that I do not agree with the idea of territorial constituencies , and making them compulsory for countries with a population of over 20 million .
I regret that we have not been able to do this , but I trust that we will be able to resolve it between now and December .
It seems to me that the situation of the borders of Afghanistan and support for the refugees and the neighbouring countries , issues which the European Union has to deal with , provide us with a perfect opportunity to test this directive , to test the solidarity between the Member States in the European Refugee Fund and to implement what is laid down in it .
The practical messages for the public that you are proposing as regards the awareness-raising raising campaigns can be introduced by means of the cooperation that Parliament is pursuing with the consultative group on the practical aspects of the changeover to the euro , which is made up of the individuals in charge of the various national campaigns .
Madam representative of the Council , we have listened to Kofi Annan &apos; s report on the most recent information regarding the referendum and we attended the 25th Conference on the support by European NGOs of the Saharaoui people a few weeks ago in the Canary Islands .
By contrast , I am certainly in a position to circulate directives prepared and adopted during the present Commission &quot; s term of office .
At the moment we know that the Commission has the possibility , the means and the resources , to provide more aid .
As its very name indicates , the conciliation procedures require each of the parties to give some ground so that a final agreement can be reached .
I would add something else : we must resolve this issue during this legislature , before it comes to an end , given the political importance it has .
The Spanish version of Recital G says &apos; sea craftsmen such as oyster farmers and seafood breeders &apos; .
It will be beneficial to extend the reduced rates to babies &apos; nappies and equipment for people with disabilities , electronic books , environmental sewerage and recycling works , as well as all housing , places of worship and cultural and artistic heritage , restaurants , gardening and personal care services .
In its external dimension , Europe must play a leading role in developing fair rules for globalisation .
I should like to mention the importance of video &apos; s exponential growth as an element of communication between different people , and between different institutions and companies .
To sum up , therefore , we can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 7 , but we cannot accept Amendments Nos 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 and 13 .
This situation has been going on for 16 years .
And in this regard I agree with the honourable Members and the rapporteur , Mr Jarzembowski , in particular .
There has never been so much pro-Americanism Americanism , so much Americanism , we could say , within our societies as a whole and , obviously , also within our political , cultural and social elites as a whole .
Fourthly , in accordance with the resolution we adopted this morning on the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , we must also urge that Commission to adopt a specific resolution on Nepal and to appoint a Special Rapporteur to monitor the human rights situation in that country .
Mr President , as has already been said , the Treaty of Lisbon is finally going to enter into force and some of the effects of this entry into force will be felt immediately after it is signed ; for example , some of the work of the Committee on Budgets must be governed by new rules starting from January .
This is , unfortunately , more the norm than the exception .
No other fleets are allowed to make use of fishing opportunities paid for but not fished . This is certainly not the case under the southern agreements .
There is no doubt that if proper use were made of these instruments they would all play their part in improving the quality and competitiveness of our system of research , development and innovation .
I am convinced that basically , increased capacity for growth in Europe depends on two factors , namely more employment in Europe and more productive employment .
It is therefore essential that we create a genuine statute for the victims of crime , a common statute for all the Member States .
And I am proud of having contributed to placing the European Parliament once again at the forefront of the fight against the impunity of criminals and at the forefront of the defence of human rights .
The second reason , which is very important , is that there is broad consensus in our country on the parliamentary ratification of this Treaty , both among those of us who agree with this Treaty and even among the minorities who do not agree .
Mr President , the climate change policy is an open process in which the Member States all share certain final objectives and recognise certain instruments which will make this process a reality .
Furthermore , renewable energy sources are a factor in the availability of supply , and we therefore have an enormous potential for production within the European Union .
The intention is to combine purely academic matters with moves to strengthen the working of civil society in Mediterranean partner countries and to help promote better understanding of the different cultures and respect for human rights and minorities in these countries .
As you have said , the point is that Europe must exploit its research potential as much as it possibly can , and to that end , women of excellence must have the same opportunities as men of excellence .
Madam President , livestock farms are suffering the consequences of the crisis . Moreover , they have to comply with the strictest standards in the world , increasing their production prices , with the disadvantage that this gives them in comparison with third countries .
We are assisting with this debate and let us hope that it yields the desired results , as it is already starting to do .
European citizens , and also terrorists , must see that we are not resigned to living with terror . The citizens must be aware that we are prepared to take every necessary decision and to use all the instruments available under the rule of law to safeguard their security , to ensure their liberty and to defeat the terrorist strategy .
The argument of the President-in in-Office Office of the Council is that there is a risk that the Charter will not be accepted by all the Member States as legally binding .
I would like to end , Madam President , by thanking the European Ombudsman for his work promoting the transparency and efficiency of the European institutions and furthermore for his independence , which has been clear to us throughout this time .
However , I would like to repeat a question that I raised during the debate on this report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
It would be interesting , for example , to know what the Commission thinks , from a European point of view , about the Baltic gas pipeline and European solidarity .
We do not know which new structural needs we will have to deal with between now and 2006 and a degree of flexibility is therefore necessary within the spending categories , while always respecting the principle of maintaining the current financial perspectives which are now entering the third year of their difficult and eventful life .
My group and Parliament - if we reflect the vote of the relevant committee - proposes to place more trust in the Commission so that it may decide on projects of less than EUR 5 million and we also ask that the Commission be accompanied by a Council advisory committee .
Therefore , I am pleased that it now exists , and I congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , on her report .
This issue has yet to be resolved and I hope that at some point , the House and the European Union will take action .
We therefore appeal to the Commission and accept as Members of this House that we have a duty to act as well as to consider .
There are two ways of doing this : one is the establishment of a common and strong European Union foreign and defence policy ; the other is to make progress towards a European Union presence on the Security Council in a positive way and on the basis of speeding up the current constitution-building building process , which ensures that the voice of its peoples , by means of their representatives , are respected by governments and that we establish as soon as possible a European Constitution which allows us to implement a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name .
The Spanish farmers are very concerned about the Spanish Government &quot; s failure to act in this respect .
In my opinion , these can now be withdrawn following last week &apos; s agreement .
We are aware of the significance of the work done in the International Maritime Organisation and I therefore wish to reiterate my thanks to the European Parliament for its support for the Community &quot; s membership of the IMO .
To be precise the Madrid Agreement uses only English and French .
The only way in which we can preserve the European social model is by making it sustainable , viable and fundable , and this is achieved through growth and employment , which are , of course , the approaches that we have to support .
Having said that , we support what the Commissioner has said and , in particular , the excellent report by Mr Wijkman , and we would like to acknowledge his good work and his efforts aimed at synthesis and compromise .
Therefore , there are few amendments .
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs , Mr Zīle and Mr El Khadraoui .
I would like them please to speak to me directly , or , if not , write to me , because I believe we are violating Community law and taking a step backwards in terms of European integration .
Why do we have to place them under suspicion by subjecting them to labelling ?
As Parliament has already noted in two resolutions , reform is necessary to modernise the schools so that they provide the required quality of service for which they were established , are accessible and overcome specific problems of access or segregation .
Likewise , promoting organ donation by living donors across the European Union to the levels in Scandinavian countries , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands would free a further 2 000 people from dialysis every year .
We attach a great deal of importance to this process and hope that the Commission will fully take on board the comments that Parliament makes .
The Europe of the 11 is in a phase of upward growth , with a level of price stability which we can consider practically absolute .
Last week , the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre .
It is direct taxes that should be progressive .
I am not an expert and obviously this chemical issue is much more complex , but I believe that at this stage we should be well aware of some of the disasters caused by napalm and depleted uranium .
I believe we have to consider what we are doing .
Thanks to that report , I believe that we have been able to hold an extremely interesting debate , because it stresses once again what I believe to be absolutely fundamental in the Lisbon Agenda .
That nomination falls to the Council , but there is also a provision for Parliament to express its view following hearings or interviews with the candidates proposed by the Council .
I belong to the Catalan nation , the language spoken by more than 7 million people - in other words , more speakers than two of the current official languages of the European Union , and more speakers than six of the languages of the 10 candidate states .
I believe that not even the greatest will in the world would allow a positive assessment of this issue at Laeken .
The Socialist Group , which is interested in combating fraud as well as protecting the rights of citizens , including officials , and the construction of a Europe based on the principles of fair play , democracy , proximity to the citizens , transparency , efficiency and solidarity , has presented an amendment to paragraph 29 of this report , which lays down the principle that combating fraud should not take precedence over the basic rights of officials .
The more liberalised an economy is , the more necessary it becomes to rigidly regulate the financial markets .
But it is necessary because in every group there are going to be people who defend this report as necessary to public health while other colleagues , with the great respect and affection in which we hold them , will consider that this report is over the top .
Mr President , India is a State whose independence and foundation in the middle of the last century was possible based on a mass and globally respected social mobilisation , which was built on a doctrine of passive resistance as a political resource .
It would be appropriate for the Commission to provide the House with some information on the implications of this agreement for the Commission &quot; s legislative programme .
We need to review the current policy of extremely reduced stocks .
The only way to acquire them lies in our economy &apos; s capability to offer our consumers and consumers in third countries goods and services which are competitive on international markets .
Peace will have another chance , if Prime Minister Ala &quot; s government gets to work and discharges its responsibilities regarding security , and if the Israeli Government is able to demonstrate restraint and generosity so as to reduce tension .
But I should like to emphasize that the agreement itself lays down , as one of its first provisions , that one essential feature of the new framework of our relations is to be respect for human rights and democratic principles .
It has been significant in terms of its meaning but also in terms of its lack of achievement .
I cannot give you any other answer at the moment .
We should not disappoint those sectors that are looking to the West , including the European Union .
Madam President , the Mercosur countries are currently experiencing an unprecedented political , economic and social crisis . This is not our observation , but that of the Heads of State of Mercosur at their meeting in Asunción last September .
She regrets their inadequate implementation and feels that investment is undoubtedly the key issue to focus on in future . The Commission certainly welcomes Parliament &quot; s renewed endorsement of the main axes of the strategy on economic policy contained in the Broad Guidelines .
I think that everything is known about desertification , but very little action is being taken .
We have now finished the speeches under the &apos; catch-the the-eye eye &apos; procedure .
We have another public , which only uses traditional media - television and radio - via their respective national , regional or local channels and stations .
It must be remembered that they are not fighting the Israeli occupiers because they are Jews , but because they are occupiers .
The difference is that the rectification must be profound and must be ordered , led by our conviction that the Union is needed and that we must not act hastily .
In actual fact , they are grouped together more for what they are not than for what they are .
Without innovation , it will be impossible to achieve the Lisbon Strategy &quot; s sustainable growth and employment objectives .
It should be a positive message , one of good will , but it should also be rigorous so as to boost the negotiating process and stimulate the advancement of modernising , democratic reforms in Turkey .
All this supports the Lisbon proposal , but it also supports this possible action on behalf of small and medium-sized sized enterprises .
But democracy cannot consist of participation - for example - by companies , in arbitrary fora , in consultations of a particular nature .
First of all , the cultural one .
I am therefore very pleased , Mr President , that we are dealing here with a six-month month programme during which , as most Members have pointed out , much is going to be done and many initiatives are going to be taken .
The victim should not have to flee , should not have to hide , should be able to remain in their home , in their own environment , with sufficient protection and far away from the aggressor .
It is a decision by the management of Renault and we express our solidarity with the Vilvoorde workers .
We want the fisheries sector to develop and poverty to be overcome in these archipelagos : in other words , we want development aid .
In these circumstances , I simply feel that it is not the best time to enter into an international agreement with long-term term consequences .
Furthermore , the usual cliché of linking the funding of fisheries agreements to prior cost-benefit benefit analyses is not practical at this stage .
I am speaking to ask you , as President , to protect the rights of the Members , in particular the honour of Mr Schulz .
This agreement , which was reached under the Spanish Presidency - which I would especially like to thank for its efforts , along with the rest of the Permanent Representations and , of course , my fellow Members and the services of this House - substantially improves passengers &apos; rights . This is particularly true for persons of reduced mobility , as we have been persistently asked by disabled persons &apos; associations .
The victims have described savage beatings , rapes , abductions , death threats and , on occasions , murders .
In that way people will feel more comfortable and more at ease and it will be easier to take account of the diversity of problems posed by the different types of qualifications and research , as well as the varying characteristics of practical training .
However , in the resolution on the Commission &apos; s communication on the textile and clothing sector , and in the actual plan of action that the Commission then drew up , there is already a series of proposals along these lines .
With proposals of four hours , in my region I cannot even get from one part to another , let alone participate in other international markets , which is my right .
It is clear , Mr President , that we must recover the path of sustainable growth and job creation .
