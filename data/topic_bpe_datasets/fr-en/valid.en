Overall , it is a challenge we must accept in the interests of the European Union , and its stability for the continent of Europe , peace and democracy , and even to ensure the smooth running of the internal market , giving it new opportunities .
The second important point is that we need to guarantee emergency humanitarian aid in order to allevi@@ ate the aw@@ ful conditions under which the people have been living for several months now .
Having been elected President of our Assembly today , you also hold this political balance between institutions which is necessary for a clearly @-@ defined defined future , for a shared undertaking on Europe , for internal reform and for the whole Assembly .
As your report emphasises , the Commission has already adopted the recommendation on quality assurance and the recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of statutory auditors .
What is your position on this ?
The Commission will be monitoring this in particular to ensure that the specific situation of these most vulnerable people is adequately taken into account .
I hope therefore that the Intergovernmental Conference , which is currently under way , will result in a qualified majority vote and that , in the cases which appear to be most important for the large majority of Member States , we are thereby able to arrive at some sensible decisions .
You are right , there has undoubtedly been some delay , but today we are hard at work and we must now press on resolutely .
We can only hope that the echoes of our debates will reach the Commission nevertheless .
I agree with Mr Trakatellis : you cannot play gam@@ es with patients &amp; apos ; health when they expect our help , or with non @-@ governmental governmental organisations which need these Community budgets to deliver the health policies on the ground .
Everything must be done to prevent this .
Today we are embarking on another debate .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal seeking to improve the directive &amp; apos ; s objectives would , nevertheless , appear quite appropriate .
Now let us look at things a little more closely .
Finally , a word on the Court of Justice .
As a Socialist , I therefore support the substance of the proposals included in our joint resolution .
Mrs in &amp; apos ; t Veld , please allow me to speak frankly : the Commission does not have the authority to modify the provisions of the treaty regarding the legal basis applicable to this competition policy .
However , we must still provide for protection of European intellectual property and repatriate to Europe patents for inventions created in Europe , but currently kept in the United States .
I would draw your attention to the fact that this debate on the exclusion of persons affected by &amp; apos ; d@@ ys &amp; apos ; ability is not to be translated into the official languages of the European Union .
However , the granting of financial assistance will remain subject to strict conditions , which I think is necessary .
Yet has this European solidarity , which Dublin is rightly receiving today , as it did when it joined the EU , been shown over the years by the Irish Government itself ?
I am however much more sceptical when it comes to asking the Commission for clarification on applying rules regulating competition and the internal market to public services .
We can only be pleased about that .
the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy on the Council common position for adopting a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Elec@@ tronic Communications Market Authority ( 16@@ 4@@ 98 / 1 / 2008 - C6 @-@ 0067 0067 / 2009 - ( Rapporteur : Mrs del Castillo Vera ) , and
Firstly , on the annual accounts , the Court of Auditors has issued a positive Sta@@ tement of As@@ surance .
For the same reasons , further reinforced by the events of recent months , our group will be voting against Mr Kittelmann &amp; apos ; s report .
This is what the rapporteur means ; in other words , it must undergo a test of compatibility with the principles of the internal market .
We do not yet have a policy on demand , networks or human capacities .
The European Parliament and the Commission clearly do not see matters in this light .
I count on Parliament &amp; quot ; s support in this respect .
After ten years , it is high time that we looked at the aspects that have not worked .
This is an appropriate moment to point out that Member States are not making sufficient efforts to ensure that disabled people enjoy the same rights as non @-@ disabled disabled people .
Mr President , first of all I must pay tribute to the spirit of consultation and dialogue shown by the rapporteur .
There are some fundamentally different views and some clear national interests , but this in itself is not so unusual .
Mr President , before you call a vote on compromise Amendment No 22 , I would like to intervene regarding paragraph 8 in its entirety .
Several things will need to be implemented .
It is peace in the region and throughout the world that is at stake .
The views of the Commission and Parliament coincide , and they coincide with those of the public too .
That is not all , however .
Mr President , a few weeks ago Ireland said &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; , and I think that , as we all know , this illustrates the increasing split between European citizens .
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity .
There is a digital divide between rich and poor countries , but it also exists within the EU itself .
Report : Schwaiger ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 62 00@@ 62 / 1999 )
We are making progress by taking the Irish requests seriously , and I address this remark to Mrs Doyle and Mrs McGuin@@ ess .
With regard to foot @-@ and and @-@ mouth mouth disease , similar provisions have already been put in place .
That is why I shall vote for this report .
Let us hope that , as part of the work to be carried out within the temporary committee on climate change , the cause and effect link that exists between this phenomenon and the loss of biodiversity will make progress possible .
A more liberal Europe is unfolding behind the More Europe theme , and this is the credo of the market .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the report by Mr See@@ ber because of its merits .
It gives Europe &amp; quot ; s citizens more power .
The Commission proposal before us today seeks to update the Community regulations on the coordination of the Member States &amp; quot ; social security schemes in order to take account of changing national legislation , to clarify the legal position regarding certain articles of those regulations and to take account of recent developments in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities , especially as concerns Annex II@@ a of Regulation 1408 / 71 .
There is still time to stop this irresponsible action .
It is difficult to adapt to change and this is to be expected .
On the other hand - and this will be the challenge for the Copenhagen conference - it is just as urgent to combat climate change by reducing energy consumption .
This report in fact supports the Commission &amp; apos ; s position in this field and is very much in the spirit of the Euratom Treaty , an outdated treaty with the very much official objective of promoting the use of nuclear energy , which is in itself highly questionable .
Far from eliminating stability , we have added stability to the preventive aspects of the Pact .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the rapporteur for the good work she has done .
This applies , of course , to fish stocks , where this balance is needed , but it also concerns coastal economies .
in writing . - Just for once , Brussels wants to take back through the window what the French , Dutch and Irish thre@@ w out the door in the 2005 and June 2008 referendums : the establishment of a single European Public Prosecutor &amp; apos ; s Office .
The Commission and the parliaments and the Council and the Court of Justice must all be strengthened .
Mr President , it is extremely rare for a report to be quite so turned around after the vote in committee .
Mr President , I am afraid there has been a slight mix @-@ up up .
My only reticence relates to the lack of flexibility in the exemption mechanism in the case of new products or activities .
I would draw the attention of all the political families to the fact that we , the European Parliament and the Commission , must strengthen each other on a mutual basis .
Without individual security for these journalists , there is no freedom of expression , and if the press do not have freedom of expression , there is no democracy !
In addition to this , the legislation allowing specific action to be taken is relatively complex and will therefore slow down initiatives .
I will take this opportunity to announce that the Commission also intends , in the context of the European elections , to run special activities in the framework of the Deb@@ ate Europe Plan D initiative .
Moreover , commenc@@ ing military action in this region will set the Arab world ab@@ la@@ ze , plunge the people into decades of poverty , and send weakened political regimes into the arms of fundamentalism .
I genuinely believe we need to sort this out , and that is why I think , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , that Parliament &amp; apos ; s resistance is not a question of pride .
I have consulted widely with colleagues from the various groups and they have assured me that they will not obstruct my proposal .
It is true that Europe is not just about what is reasonable .
We did not build the internal market in one go .
For the rest , I am happy to attend any committee you like .
The fall in world co@@ co@@ a prices risks being catastrophic for many of them .
We think all this is extremely worrying for the future .
These horrendous acts are an attack not only on the United States but against humanity itself and the values and freedoms we all share .
Amendments Nos 1 , 7 and 8 are acceptable as they stand .
Meanwhile , the common position against Cuba is being maintained .
Furthermore , in view of unfair competition from some of our competitors , who base their competitive advantages on social and environmental dumping , or both , Europe needs effective tools to defend itself .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this report is excellent .
That is its duty and the citizens will judge it on the results .
We would simply like to draw your attention to three points .
In a few weeks , I will let you know what I am going to do in that regard and I will tell you whether or not we need to regulate .
Some people would also like to concentrate the Structural Funds even further on the poorest regions .
It is up to us to continue our efforts because , as our Commissioner said , this is an ongoing task .
It is a very precious asset , made possible by the quality of the European Union &amp; quot ; s intervention .
Mr President , I intend to speak specifically about the Mediterranean region which , as the rapporteurs have reminded us - and I thank them for doing so - is very important to Europe in foreign @-@ policy policy terms .
Mr President , before beginning my explanation of vote , I should like to draw attention to the Rules of Procedure .
As this is a debate on the reforms which must be undertaken in future in the context of the process of major institutional reform which Parliament is firmly demanding and which is at last gaining widespread support , we feel it is imperative that the Council should attend .
I shall make three brief comments , as I have very little time .
It can do this in two ways .
A number of associations - I am thinking in particular of the European Li@@ aison Committee on Services of General Inte@@ rest , which has an in @-@ depth depth knowledge of these issues - have also drafted proposals of a legal nature which amount to saying : yes , a proposal for a framework directive is not unthinkable , and , moreover , must be consistent with the four principles that you mentioned in your introductory speech .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , these are some ideas formulated by the Commission and which were put to the European Parliament and the European Council .
What stage are the candidate countries at ?
Mr President , Commissioner , I hope that during the coming legislature , the Commission will table a directive that plu@@ gs the gaps of non @-@ discrimination discrimination between women and men in fields not yet covered .
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with &amp; apos ; communitisation &amp; apos ; or the consolidation of Fortress Europe .
Matters must be made clear , and not complicated by last @-@ minute minute amendments .
Mr President , first of all we should congratulate the rapporteur for the quality of her report , although some comments are called for .
We must not now adopt an overly hasty position out of a sense of urgency .
The Commission cannot move forward without a Council that assumes its political responsibilities .
The question of climate change and the resul@@ tant apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tic visions are a forceful and global way of drawing attention to the dangers of pollution .
If that is not feasible because a unanimous decision is required , then you need to say what is hin@@ dering progress .
For example , we began with the &amp; apos ; Everything but arms &amp; apos ; initiative , which allows a number of countries among the poorest in the world to diversify their exports .
The EGF is an important instrument because it helps to show that the European Union takes full account of the social impact of globalisation and that it is not losing interest in the fate of employees .
In my view , the compromise reached with the Council offers progress in two essential directions .
That of creating paperwork , and of financing studies and reports .
I fully endorse the adoption of this resolution from the European left criticising the inadequacy of the amendments made by Hungary to its media law , while the right welcomes them .
I shall support the Commission &amp; apos ; s interpretation of the result of our negotiations over Article 19 .
I have another thought on this subject : it is now clear that the commitment of the Commission and the Member States must not be the monopoly of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs or of the Ministers for Development .
The implications are significant for the agro @-@ food food sector overall , which has been struck squarely by this crisis .
We would like the European Parliament to be genuinely involved in the preparation of the negotiation mandate and , to this end , this text should be made available to us .
I am completely co@@ gn@@ isant of the need to keep you well informed .
Croatia clearly has a place in the European Union .
We must no longer accept these countries calling themselves democratic and signing conventions , which they then fail to observe .
It is the credibility of the European Parliament that is at stake .
That is extremely dangerous .
It is essential that all the members of the Union ratify the Council of Europe &amp; apos ; s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages .
Fourthly , fishing is an occupation with many motivated and competent people in responsible positions , people who are highly experienced and who are concerned with preserving the ethics of fishing , and who do not hesitate to share their extremely interesting local experiences so that lessons may be learned from them .
Madam President , I would like to stress the fact that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund that we have set up is addressed to workers , to improve their employability .
Mr President , Mr S@@ ócrates , I welcome the fact that justice and internal affairs constitute one of the priorities of your Presidency .
I propose limited use , and in particular I propose a moratorium on its use among Europeans .
The Presidency is constantly and closely following developments in the political situation in that country , and in particular the preparation and conduct of the elections on 6 March .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the legislative resolution approving , subject to amendments , the proposal for a Council regulation amending the regulation of 2003 as regards jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning applicable law in matri@@ moni@@ al matters , and this on the basis of the report by Mrs Gebhardt .
The Commission would now ask its institutional partners to get down to the task right now , so that the tripartite discussions can be started as soon as possible .
In actual fact , I believe that it might be time to carry out an in @-@ depth depth reform of this Treaty .
We must continue to strengthen our policy , and in this regard I would like to point out that we recently stepped up the sanctions targeting the regime and the leaders in particular .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to thank our rapporteur for his quite remarkable work , particularly when we are talking about an issue of this scale , which involves taking real action , since , for once , we will be working on consumer information , on training and on new production priorities .
That is what I can say with things as they are at present .
But to what extent are these funds used ?
All these human rights violations are crimes against humanity that need to be stopped and denounced in order to be definitively condemned .
We are firmly convinced that an ongoing dialogue with Armenia , conducted in accordance with the policy provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the ENP Action Plan , is indeed the most effective means of conveying the European Union &amp; apos ; s messages about respect for human rights and international law .
Secondly , the Union , as an area of peace and democracy , must remain the guarantor for human rights in the world by ensuring that our declarations based on our values are followed through in all European policies .
This is an extremely perverse process , in which the Commission overri@@ des the States , with their ta@@ cit approval , as regards a question that is crucial for public health and for the environment in our countries .
Faced with a regional , financial , economic , social and climate crisis , this French Presidency has been bu@@ ff@@ eted by the world &amp; apos ; s agenda .
This morning , Parliament is also proposing an ambitious report on biomass and biofuels , which are important elements in energy independence for the EU and in the fight against climate change .
I am therefore delighted that the Commission has presented a Green Paper on economic immigration .
Mr President , I congratulate Mrs Stri@@ ff@@ ler on her report .
The Liberal Group therefore comm@@ ends the moderate nature of this compromise .
In my opinion , we should stick to the Commission text .
I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the cases of Belgium and Ireland , as I consider that we should use all possible means to help employees who are victims of the damage caused by globalisation and the economic and financial crisis .
When they want to get elected , government promise to work for the common good , everyone &amp; apos ; s interests , the country &amp; apos ; s prosperity .
Nevertheless , people may feel that this work and the implementation of the action plans adopted by the Council are not bearing sufficient fruit .
Of course , I call for the moratorium on GMO authorisations to remain in place until this legislation has been adopted .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s ambition is to introduce this coherent European framework for a return policy that is both effective and respectful of rights , and is also under democratic control .
This is an essential issue when it comes to ensuring food security and to embarking on the road to sustainability .
The report is also a good text in that respect .
Madam President , I do have one comment on yesterday &amp; apos ; s Minutes , and I will use this opportunity to raise a point of order , if I may .
However , achieving all the Millennium Development Goals , in the context of sustainable development , comes under a collective responsibility under which all partners should honour the commitments they have made .
It is up to the countries concerned to take the initiative of preparing and proposing projects that could be supported financially by Community funds and European Investment Bank loans .
It can be seen where all that would lead us if this directive were to be adopted .
in writing . - For once we were tempted to vote in favour of a report on VAT by this Parliament .
We must safeguard the freedom of movement of persons and equality in social , economic , cultural and political rights .
Finally , as regards the forthcoming G20 summit , the European Union must present a united front to ensure that this international body plays the role that is expected of it and does not merely indulge in endless talk .
Although we are so keen on this initiative , that is not because we think it is sufficient in itself .
the right of European nations to self @-@ determination determination and to remain as they are , flouted by proposals aimed at opening up Europe even more to global immigration - a development to which the nationals of our countries are meant to adapt ;
That goes without saying .
Madam President , I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs .
Commissioner , Mr President , I think that Europe must state three main principles in this Millennium Round .
First point , in the European Union - you have said so and everyone has said so - we are short of innovation , which is the consequence of the relative tri@@ m@@ ming back in our research effort . This has occurred in spite of the initiatives of the European Commission .
T@@ imes have changed , and the French Presidency has also changed a lot of things .
We will therefore support them .
We in Europe have , unfortunately , already experienced such acts : in Germany , Italy , France , Spain and many other countries .
Mr President , I would like to draw Parliament &amp; apos ; s attention to the problem of Kosovo and , particularly , to the need for the European Parliament to be able to answer for this European internal matter and to ensure that the right of the people to determine their own future can , quite rightly , be respected .
We are therefore in favour of this tax , but when it is put to the vote tomorrow , an overwhelming vote is needed .
First , may I remind you of the importance we attach to institutional reform of the Union .
Not to rise to this historic occasion would be to deny our own work as buil@@ ders of Europe and would , for some considerable time , in@@ hi@@ bit what we wish to see , namely the ambitious development of European integration ...
A limit must be placed on farming subsidies and they must be designed to be of more benefit to small and medium @-@ sized sized farms , as well as to employment .
On the other hand , budgetary expansion in countries that have suffered the biggest slowdown , like France and Germany , has had three main effects .
I touched on this in connection with closer cooperation .
Despite the concessions made by Parliament , some Member States who , unlike me , do not believe in the added value of the European budget , have remained inflexible .
Thirdly , and finally , a new initiative should not distract us from our multilateral priority .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Mr President , I have listened carefully to all the contributions .
It is obvious , Mr President , this report , in our opinion , is not fit to be adopted .
The Commission does not want to appear to be shut off in its iv@@ ory to@@ wer devising regulations to impose on the good people .
Accordingly , our Parliament should seize the present opportunity to take a historic initiative by formulating proposals for submission to the Convention on the Future of Europe .
We must welcome and help them .
At a time when the negotiations at the World Trade Organization are deadlocked and the European Union is preparing to negotiate bilateral agreements , the report maps out the route to trade cooperation with that very important part of the American continent .
Apart from the fact that they are subject to the requirements of the regulation , they can be told that some countries are already operating the system perfectly happily .
No one talks about that - except perhaps Mr Medina Ortega , who says somewhere in his report that he has his doubts .
That is the mark of a European Union that can act and make progress while taking account of freedoms and fundamental rights .
This would involve the implementation of a genuine quota system which should be both coherent and uniform .
I would thank the rapporteur for his efforts at moderation and conciliation .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , Commissioner , you have just supported us in the initiative that we , the European Parliament , plan to take on this issue .
The bul@@ lets of fanatics and individuals motivated by reven@@ ge , intolerance and rejection of others have made it even more difficult to seek dialogue , compromise and peace .
If I have referred several times already to developing countries , it is for two reasons .
To sum up , I shall say that , once again , I am surprised by the European logic which prevails in the area of common policy .
At tomorrow &amp; apos ; s vote , think about what you will say to any of your fellow citizens who asks you what you have done .
This will create a political situation which will be difficult to handle .
The Commission will continue to examine other methods of raising businesses &amp; apos ; awareness , if it deems this appropriate .
The European Parliament &amp; apos ; s contribution was substantial in this matter .
That is why we support Mr Trakatellis &amp; apos ; report , which is the result of numerous exchanges between us and which enables us to demonstrate to the Council that the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s opinions on health matters must be taken into consideration .
However , the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Mediterranean relationship is an asymmetric relationship that is both emo@@ tive and irrational .
Do we want the future of Europe to be decided tomorrow behind closed government doors or do we believe , more than ever , in the need to build a democratic Europe ?
Parliament will therefore be on an equal footing with the Council which , in democratic terms , obviously represents huge progress .
It is too little , even though it is better than nothing .
The effort we are prepared to make must be matched by all other parties supporting exports . We trust also that all industrialised countries will play their part in opening up markets .
However , we do not take the same stance as the rapporteur , who is in favour of &amp; apos ; fair competition &amp; apos ; in this sector .
Naturally , we also accept critical comments when we are not doing something correctly .
Most of the countries worst affected by AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis are unable to produce the necessary treatments themselves .
I think that this is crucial , given that its importance is constantly emphasised in the context of building a European research area .
Mr President , today &amp; apos ; s debate is a painful and sad experience for the three parties involved : Parliament , Council and Commission .
One day we will have to go further .
We have to take more action and act more effectively .
The US is now trying to impose a concept of pre @-@ emptive emptive war against Iraq which falls outside the scope of international law .
The European Council which met on 22 and 23 March 2005 , and of which I have already spoken in connection with relaunching the Lisbon strategy , has already adopted some key elements which will be essential for design@@ ing the future climate regime .
We will work on this .
The first point is the reference to total allow@@ able catches , the infamous TACs , and the question of quotas , which should remain the cornerstone of the common fisheries policy .
I will also insist on the role of the European Parliament in monitoring the convergence and competitiveness pact because the Commission , of course , will fully inform the European Parliament .
To be more precise , however , it does not believe it is essential for such an obligation to appear in this text .
After extensive discussion with the Council , we achieved what we wanted on several points .
You declared , Mr President , that we must reassert the values uniting us and defend the spirit of the founders of the European Union , whose goals were peace and stability in Europe .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , you expressed the wish that we should devote our efforts today to the forthcoming European Council meeting in Biarritz , and this will indeed be an important milestone in this half @-@ year year Presidency of the Council .
It is those parties and moderate figures that we have to encourage as much as possible , because they and only they hold the keys to a peaceful and sustainable solution in the region .
Neither does it address the interests of the EU ; the more we are committed to fostering an economic dynamic in Ukraine through our mediation , the more we have everything to lose from the destabilisation of such an economically and politically fragile country and , on a broader scale , region .
Moreover , we want to preserve small @-@ scale scale fishing , which is so very important in the regions concerned , where it provides a livelihood for thousands of people , as has been said .
This agreement enables a new balance to be found for the European Commission &amp; quot ; s proposal which , in the context of the WTO decision , made it still more difficult for countries faced with serious public health problems to gain access to medicines .
That is wonderful .
Madam President , I would like to make a further point concerning page 22 of the Minutes .
I repeat : it is a compromise amendment which was clearly submitted after the deadline , it is presented by two political groups and it seeks to render null and void all the other amendments .
I have noted your willingness to make that contribution if the Union asks you to do so , which I hope it will .
Report ( A5 @-@ 0179 0179 / 2000 ) by Mr Lehne , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a Council regulation listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement ( COM ( 2000 ) 27 - C5 @-@ 01@@ 66 01@@ 66 / 2000 - 2000 / 00@@ 30 ( CN@@ S ) )
The essential values are not just written in the texts ; they are also put into practice in the European Union &amp; apos ; s policies .
I feel that these two approaches , the Charter and the social agenda , complement each other and properly reflect our determination to place social matters at the heart of the construction of Europe .
Alongside these plans we should introduce close dialogue with these governments , but also with the populations and organisations of these countries , to whom we must give the means to play a role in their own reconstruction .
I would therefore like to request a report concerning the vote on the legislative proposal .
Mr President , Europe is currently in crisis : there is a financial crisis , a macroeconomic crisis , a social crisis and a moral crisis .
The competent national administrations are by no means familiar with these procedures .
This is a symbol of a downward spiral that can only lead to an escalation of violence .
My conclusion is therefore clear .
B@@ ac@@ ked up by the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank , this fund should allow public services - or community services of general interest , if you like - to be expanded , and should provide aid for industry , research and training .
I shall try to show that the confidence of the European Parliament is well founded , and essential to the completion of the Union &amp; apos ; s ambitious programme in the months to come .
As was the case in respect of women and children , it is certainly now time for all the nations of the world to consider the protection of the fundamental rights of disabled people and the respect of these rights .
The European Union is claiming to be a factor for stabilisation in the former Yugoslavia .
Nevertheless , this liberalisation has to be progressive and reciprocal in such a way that it takes account of the different interests of the countries concerned .
I think that is quite a quick response .
Mr President , there is a rather unusual , not to say original , question I should like to put to the European Commissioner .
. I thank the honourable Member for the relevance of his questions .
Ladies and gentlemen , this has been a lengthy process .
We must take the psych@@ ology of the public into consideration and we must ensure that dialogue is established .
As we are quite aware , we have no legislative authority to enforce a European right .
We now know what we have to do in the political arena , and I believe we are making progress .
It is necessary because we need to bring the common organisation of the market in sugar into line with the guiding principles of the new common agricultural policy .
However , I must emphasise that this should not be at the expense of those who have been able to reduce their energy dependence by using fishing methods and equipment which are better suited to current requirements .
We will therefore obviously vote against Mr Stubb &amp; apos ; s report , which attempts to bring back through the window a Constitution that two European nations have thrown out the door .
This crisis , which began in the financial sector , has plunged the European economy into severe recession .
Mr President , let us therefore have a firm desire to put this potential to good use .
On top of all that , then , the December European Council is asking us to speed up our work .
Indeed , how can we draft European policies if we do not have data on the situation in each Member State ?
In promoting cross @-@ border border , transnational and interregional cooperation , this cross @-@ disciplinary disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory .
The Commission will continue its analysis and will encourage debate by organising working parties for each issue .
Time does not permit me today to look at all the policy areas concerned , but there are three that are particularly urgent .
In this regard , I hope the European Commission will be in a position to put to Parliament a proposal for a comprehensive European Union directive on disabled people at some time in the future .
But , I know , as all of us in this House know , that you , Commissioner , are making every effort to bring this project to fruition .
Quite the opposite .
Admittedly , it has been ton@@ ed down at certain times but , believe me , we have not finished with our endeavours , and I am obviously relying both on Mr Wijkman and on certain Member States at Council level to help us to preserve the best and most progressive aspects of the statement .
However , the majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs sadly did not think it worthwhile to adopt any of the paragraphs in this opinion .
They show that the problem of immigration and unemployment is out in the open today , that there is a link between the two , and I think that the Commission , instead of following the tw@@ add@@ le of anti @-@ racism racism , should concern itself with the extension and opening up of our legislation to national and community preference .
Consid@@ erable adjustment efforts are asked of them ; that is a financial constraint which cannot be sustained by the ACP countries themselves or by the EDF , but which requires supplementary funds to be specially allocated by the European Union .
I would like to make it clear that I do not believe that , on the pretext of combating nicotine addiction , we must phase out raw tobacco cultivation in the Community .
Madam President , during a previous debate on nuclear power , I expressed a certain number of concerns about this form of energy .
It is advisable , in fact , to strengthen the efforts of the regional organisations and to establish , within the framework of the EU Neighbourhood Policy , how we can reach agreements with the other countries bordering the Mediterranean basin .
But , and I am not saying &amp; apos ; but &amp; apos ; in a restrictive way , it is simply an expression of the concern for legal security that I mentioned , you know as well as we do that the use of Article 308 is cause for quite widespread reservation and that , in any event , it requires unanimous agreement following consultation of the European Parliament .
It is , however , a constantly evolving process and we need above all to approach it from a political standpoint . That is , in my opinion , the most original feature of the report I am submitting to you .
What is true is that we are paying close attention to the problems to which we need to find the right solutions .
In addition , freedom of movement in Europe enables criminal networks to profit from the opening up of the European Union &amp; apos ; s internal borders while at the same time exploiting the lack of European coordination with regard to justice and thus ev@@ ading capture .
Indeed , Europe must make sure that accelerated procedures are not systematically implemented across the board and that the need for international protection , the right of asylum and the principle of non @-@ refoulement refoulement are safeguarded .
I am counting on your support , Commissioner , to ensure that the legislative proposals for reform which the Commission will shortly be submitting will show a better understanding of the situation in our most remote regions .
It is important to achieve a more social Europe , therefore to have more European social legislation .
There is a clear democratic deficit today , and if the Council and the Commission continue to make proposals that fail to take Parliament &amp; apos ; s opinion into account , our fellow citizens will reject our project even more .
Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the speed with which the Commission has put forward the proposals to set up a solidarity fund and the promp@@ tness with which our institution is able to respond to them .
We would therefore like to see , alongside this international regulatory framework , initiatives being set up to strengthen the action that is being taken within states and civilian society , and we are ready to support them .
On 11 June the Council approved a report assessing the progress achieved by the countries of the region in relation to these conditions for European integration . The report also contained specific proposals deta@@ iling how the countries can continue working towards this aim .
The European Parliament and the Council are in the process of considering this proposal .
This statement is in my view completely misguided , and , on the contrary , I feel it is necessary to take hold of the climate @-@ change change problem in order to develop new models that are designed to produce more and better .
I would like to remind you that this Parliament recognised Catalan as a European language and gave it a specific personality .
As Mrs B@@ é@@ res and Mr Salafranca said , we must build a global alliance and wage a global fight against terrorism .
The Council has explained that the creation of territorial constituencies within a country should not , overall , undermine the proportional nature of the voting ( Article 2 ) .
It is the fisheries sector which faces the most serious difficulties , and there are one or two extremely simple reasons for this .
This body would be responsible for coordinating the checks conducted by Member States at both the national and the international level .
Belarus is gradually developing a regime that gives greater precedence to progress and freedom , based on the present constitution .
The issue of the rating agencies , of their independence in relation to certain groups , and of the existence of a European rating agency will certainly be one of the crucial issues at the first summit on future regulation .
On the other hand , as the Treaty of Lisbon is due to come into force on 1 December , we must waste no time in adopting the transitional measures necessary to go from one treaty to another in the budgetary field .
But we are convinced that in order to attain the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy we must promote the cause of business and industry , because it is enterprise that basically drives job creation .
We would like the outermost regions of the Union , which do not yet feature in the document , gradually to become at least the subject of an appropriate strategy .
Improvements are still needed and , I hope , are still possible ; that is the purpose of the amendments my group has tabled .
From this perspective , I also call on our counterpart from the Council of Europe to demonstrate responsibility and to conduct a dialogue with Turkey as a Member State of the Council of Europe .
And , given your character , I have no reason to doubt this . I would therefore like , in this spirit , Mr President , to wish you good luck .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , Austria is taking on the presidency of the Council of Ministers of the Union for the first time and this raises a great deal of interest and also some very pleasing images .
I sincerely hope that it will be adopted on Wednesday at our plenary sitting .
Madam President , I am also very grateful to Mr Busuttil for his excellent report .
The resolution on the forthcoming EU @-@ US US summit and the Transatlantic Economic Council is designed to reaffirm the transatlantic agenda and to strengthen EU @-@ US US cooperation on matters of common interest .
To some extent , this is recognition and affirmation of the Union &amp; apos ; s global dimension , of its economic role , but also , and above all , of its political importance .
Our overriding concern , moreover , is to ensure that the financial resources granted by the Community to Greece enhance progress and the quality of life of the Greek citizens and this concern applies to all Member States .
We would really like to know .
At the end of the day , however , we believe the amendments have a limited scope . This is down to the agreements between the different components of the political groups and what the Council deems to be acceptable to avoid conciliation .
I know the European Parliament would like this revision to take place quite soon .
Once again , there is a great risk that in the outcome a compromise solution will be vaunted that would have been considered unacceptable at the outset .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Herman . On behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs , he highlights a number of points , doubtless some of the most important , which leave the European Parliament dissatisfied following the Treaty of Amsterdam , and which above all propose a way to try to overcome this shortcoming .
We will have the opportunity to discuss these issues again and to make decisions , when the time comes , on the basis of legislative proposals .
As rapporteur for this document , having obtained a great deal and been supported in my work by my colleagues , I would ask them to continue to show solidarity regarding our compromise agreement until it is time to vote .
This is also why I personally am shocked to find out that even today and within the European Parliament there is a movement of women trying to question the gains won over a long struggle .
In particular , I will think about this in the joint discussions on the nature of the new regional policy for 2006 @-@ 2013 2013 .
The checks currently being made will certainly result in reductions in the amounts to pay , either by excluding amounts which are not legitimate or by applying financial corrections .
In the same way , we must consider intensifying the existing link between the environment and road safety ( leading us , for example , to reass@@ ess road signs and marking to make them safer ) .
From this point of view , the fight against hunger and poverty certainly requires us to cancel debt , support education and vocational training , increase technical assistance and encourage investment in these countries which are lagging behind .
The summit took place with the dreadful tragedy of Kosovo as a backdrop .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Presidency , I would like to thank the European Parliament for this debate , which testifies to the great groundswell of solidarity shown by the peoples of Europe when this terrible cal@@ am@@ ity struck .
The opportunity to adopt the nationality of Member States is also a fundamental aspect of integrating foreign nationals in Europe , but we realise that , in this area , each country applies its own laws .
With regard to maritime transport security , passenger safety is of vital importance to us , but it is also important to take account of the transport of goods .
The only exception is the groups within the European Parliament , and they , of course , are something entirely different .
The Paasilinna report recognises some of the risks and dangers of this approach , but it is based overall on the respect for competition law .
We must do all we can to pursue the policy undertaken to reduce waste and the storage of residual waste in order to ensure and maintain our energy independence .
Mr President , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , we all agree on setting the course we are heading for beyond the French Presidency , but this forces us to mention the questions that will be raised , regardless of whether the intergovernmental conference is successful .
Without doubt , there will be Heads of State or Government who will represent their own countries .
The EU will ensure that the Action Plan reflects the priorities outlined by the Foreign Affairs Ministers at their June 2010 meeting in all three dimensions .
Services represent over half of the European economy , and are the main source of jobs .
Parliament made its view heard .
In line with the indication given by the secretariat of the committee responsible for coordinating the work of the institutions , and in agreement with the future Czech Presidency , it was decided that this common position would be forwarded to Parliament in the coming days , at the beginning of January .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council , I am delighted that we are today able to discuss and vote for a resolution on an issue that in my view does not get enough attention , for the situation facing the border communities of Sudan , Chad and the Central African Republic is quite simply intolerable and it is something that must never be forgotten in this House .
a guarantee from Member States of finance for the universal service before the opening of the markets , an essential condition for the protection of consumers .
We must all reflect on the consequences of the current institutional situation for all policies , including enlargement , and on the institutions themselves .
Why do we have to go through it again now ?
I do not think that it is up to the Commission to take the initiative in this field .
What does social cohesion mean when governments are cutting their funding to essential public services in order to cut taxes for the richest ?
I simply regret the fact that the Council is not here to participate in this important discussion in the debate between the institutions .
I hope so , Madam , as soon as possible .
If one country has an internal problem , that does not make another country &amp; apos ; s internal problem disappear .
I consider this to be reasonable , as it is a context in which decisions must be taken which are then passed on to the citizens quite openly .
This should be pointed out .
- Before the vote on Amendment 21 :
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Alexander for his presence here this afternoon , together with Mr Verheugen , whom I left in plenary last night at 11.@@ 47 p.m. and who has covered a lot of ground this part @-@ session session in Strasbourg .
The crises we have been experiencing have all underlined this need .
A first report has already been examined by the Commission and a rapporteur has been appointed .
However , in view of its desire to keep Parliament informed , the Commission was careful to send its proposal to this House at the same time as to the Council .
Yet everyone knows that no amount of policing can halt the flow of people who are in fear of their lives .
That is how the Single Market Act came into being .
In my own report , however , I have taken the liberty of d@@ welling at greater length on certain factors which are fundamental to the creation of the internal market .
Re@@ pression has instead , in response , played a part in fuelling terrorism .
Now is the time for active inclusion , to step up efforts to give particular support to these groups - a very clear echo of the Lambert report on the agenda today .
We hear a lot of talk about it , we are desperately anxious for it to materialise , but we never actually encounter it .
However , these ideas must be subject to lengthy discussion because if care is not taken to prevent this , they could also be diverted from their primary aim towards protectionist ends .
I shall conclude by mentioning the internal reform of the Commission .
You are no doubt aware of the proposals made by Commissioner Barnier in terms of structural policy .
Lastly , transport is a sector that deserves all our attention .
Obviously , such an attitude is deplorable .
This is in itself good news .
It could also encourage Member States to increase taxation on large fortunes , in order to finance effective actions to fight against exclusion .
It is also important to protect the interests of European taxpayers - this is all the more true in the current economic climate - and so we must avoid , as far as possible , entering in the budget any appropriations that cannot be utilised .
It refers to the 1996 communication concerning equal opportunities for people with disabilities , recognising their rights , rather than regarding them as people in need of charity .
It is one of the subjects we shall also be discussing at the G7 meeting in O@@ k@@ in@@ aw@@ a .
Parliament &amp; apos ; s current resolution calls on the Commission to stand firm on this issue .
With regard to this , I have told you of my intention , at least before being able to respond and if the governments agree when the time comes , to get a clearer and more objective view on the basis of the study that I am going to commission on the situation of all the islands of the various Member States of the European Union .
For the same reasons , we cannot support the supplementary and amending budget which is now before us .
The only possible solution is for the nations to have greater authority and for their parliaments to bear the main responsibility .
It may increase the effectiveness with which the centralised and decentralised procedures operate .
Mr President , I will speak for four minutes and keep the remaining two minutes for the end of the debate .
That is why I voted in favour of these two agreements .
I often talk to Mr Turmes , who has had to leave , about issues of competition in the energy markets , of the importance of which we are all aware .
It also stresses and does so very firmly - this is something that I welcome - the need to integrate the gender dimension in the measures to be taken .
Lastly , I would like to stress the need for the To@@ ys Directive and control of the CE mark .
The democrat MEPs voted against that decision .
Perhaps this will be the occasion to deepen the dialogue on values mentioned in point 29 of the motion , from the basis of a respect for our differences .
It has also been noted that tobacco advertising has a considerable influence over the behaviour of young people , encouraged to smoke in order to identify with an unrealistic lifestyle .
This is essential if we want to clear the air for the debate .
They want change both inside and outside Palestine , together with the peace that is a long time coming .
We know the texts .
They must also be considered in the wider context of the institutional reform needed .
Those are facts .
The second reason I gave was that , although Turkey had made progress in the area of human rights , much remains to be done .
Mr President , I should like to speak not only on the subject of this amendment , but also on other points of procedure , as Mr Donnelly has done .
Therefore , as recommended by the resolution , I call on the Commission to instigate proceedings at the WTO against the United States if an immediate solution to the situation is not found .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly , I too should like to congratulate our rapporteurs , Mr Elles and Mr Grech , on their painstaking work , and to thank and congratulate all of my colleagues on the tremendous work put in on this occasion by the Committee on Budgets when examining the 1 200 amendments , with the aim of meeting the expectations of the 450 million people in Europe .
I am afraid that , yet again , pressure and bargaining will carry the day and that a bad decision will be taken .
As far as we are concerned , it is not a matter of organising the continued extension of free trade better , but of prioritising the defence of social and environmental rights and of enabling all peoples to be self @-@ determining determining and to decide their own future .
We hope that the Commission will support us and that we can create a package with actors and codes that are implemented , and that they are backed by obligatory decisions , not implemented on a voluntary basis .
Since Europe , as we are continually declaring , is based on the values of humanism and solidarity , we need to put these noble sentiments into practice .
In light of these circumstances , we insist all the countries of Europe hold a referendum before opening any future accession negotiations with Turkey . Allow me to emphasise once again that such a referendum must be held in advance of any negotiations .
We refuse to accept this suicidal strategy of Hamas &amp; apos ; s that seeks to create victims and mar@@ ty@@ rs in order to launch acts of aggression against Israel .
We want to know the health impact of GMOs .
In his presentation this morning , he highlighted two points .
Having said that , the problem is by no means easy to solve , as the previous speaker made clear .
But it is not enough .
Although the European Parliament is subject to longer parliamentary procedures , it must not be condemned to inaction .
For the latter Europe , which is the one that I would like to see , a common foreign and defence policy is essential .
Such a global public agency for assessing States would be very useful in terms of ensuring that global finance and the world economy were operating properly and that , therefore , due social progress was also being made .
To ensure that this competitiveness is maintained we need to establish market access conditions that are fair , equitable and reciprocal .
My concern follows the Council &amp; apos ; s reactions , in particular , to two important questions which are marginal to the regulations but which the Council wants to add to them in order to make an overall package .
I believe respect for Community law must be general and cannot be based on selective , and therefore necessarily arbitrary , interpretations .
Parliament &amp; apos ; s services have just told me that I can vote in favour or abstain , but that I cannot vote against .
It is furthermore essential that we find a common position on the matter in hand , since this is the only way that the European Union will be able to carry any weight internationally and to defend the interests of creative arti@@ sts worldwide .
The priority objective of this programme will be to support the rule of law in Russia , complying with the democratic requirements of a modern democracy and benefiting Russian society as a whole .
I am grateful for your support for this approach .
My proposal and my position as rapporteur are unequivocal : I am wholly in favour of this Commission text , which is clear , precise and based on the principles governing the internal market .
That is a rather limited view of things . The fact is , we also need to raise the issues of research , taxation , interconnections and geo@@ strategy , and I know that , on these points , you have clear views , Madam President .
I think that if we are capable of moving forward in our discussion , without being dogmatic , looking at what is happening and what it would be appropriate to do , our ideas will begin to take shape .
These are therefore the three th@@ rus@@ ts of my report , which , of course , correspond to those of the Commission proposal .
Agreement has been reached today , and in this I rejoice .
However , we must also remain realistic and realise that we cannot achieve everything .
The Council would very much appreciate Parliament &amp; apos ; s issuing an opinion on this new proposal as soon as possible .
Thirdly and finally , I think the proposal to make implementation of the principle of equal treatment a selection criterion for any Community aid or funding is essential to promoting equality .
That is all I am saying , and no more !
- We voted against - and emphatically against the second part of paragraph 6 .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the excellent report by Lithuanian MEP Mrs Bu@@ dre@@ ik@@ a@@ itė , on mainstreaming sustainability in development cooperation policies .
The European Union urges the Iraqi Government to cooperate fully with the UN and its supporting bodies .
The subject has specifically been raised within the Business Support Network and , at the same time , the Small Business Act calls on the Member States to protect their small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises from unfair practices .
A genuine European Union strategy must prevent Member States from trying to out@@ bid each other , as this could be dangerous in this ultra @-@ sensitive sensitive region .
On 25 June 1997 the Commission adopted the Green Paper on the Community patent and on patent systems in Europe .
Mr President , I would merely note that a very anti @-@ European European group is using the European Parliament to raise this issue .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the own @-@ initiative initiative report by my Belgian fellow Member , Mr Staes , on the European Court of Auditors &amp; apos ; special report No 8 / 2007 concerning administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax ( VAT ) .
Let us hope that this new development will provide more than just a change in voc@@ abu@@ lary .
I myself voted against , because I was on the voting list for the previous report .
The European Union has to take account of the impact on relations with countries that are the target of sanctions , since sanctions are economic as much as political .
This will become a possibility next year .
But I trust that the European Parliament will continue along the path it has followed for several years .
However , I could also mention certain comments by national politicians that were not helpful in this process , and even Members of this House who do not always say what we want to hear .
We are facing increasing numbers of demands , but we can work together , the European Parliament and the European Commission , without any party @-@ political political pet@@ tin@@ ess , without pointless divisions , above all trying to unite all of those who believe that Europe has a future and who believe that we can inspire our young people to support Europe .
The issue of bon@@ uses , for instance , requires urgent action .
We are seeing a whole programme of &amp; apos ; new governance &amp; apos ; taking shape before our very eyes .
The urgency of the situation justifies the practical approach adopted .
This is essential if Europe wants to remain at the highest level of the global economy .
Gasòliba i Böhm Report ( A5 @-@ 0020 0020 / 2001 )
Economic policy includes a Lisbon agenda whose philosophy we could certainly share , but whose implementation is , in fact , deeply unbalanced , since it concentrates on the liberalisation of the sectors and neglec@@ ts the social and environmental objectives included in the agenda .
The second is that Europe &amp; quot ; s body of legislation has not been simplified .
For I have clearly understood that practical action is needed .
Despite these developments , the euro @-@ area area economy continued to expand at solid rates in 2007 , with annual real GDP growing by 2.@@ 7 % .
Far from contributing to its security , however , Israel &amp; apos ; s bombing can only fan the fl@@ ames of fundamentalism and encourage terrorism and its monstr@@ ous outra@@ ges .
It is a solution for the future that will guarantee the independence of our energy supply , access for all to electricity and the development of skilled jobs in industry .
The Lisbon agenda should also include an ambitious social policy .
The debate on the legal basis therefore remains wide open , although from a personal and tactical point of view I unreservedly endorse the proposals made by your rapporteur , Mr H@@ erre@@ ro @-@ Te@@ j@@ e@@ dor Te@@ j@@ e@@ dor , whose open @-@ mindedness mindedness , convi@@ vi@@ ality and constructive approach I commend .
We have already seen tangible signs of progress in Burma and in the resolution of conflicts with Iran and with North Korea ; these are all areas where we also need China &amp; apos ; s assistance .
The Commission reaffirms its commitment to ensure effective cooperation between institutions , to keep the strictest account of the position of Parliament and the resolutions that it could adopt respecting enforcement measures that would exceed the jurisdiction provided in the basic act and its objective , in these cases , to reach a well @-@ balanced balanced solution .
The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations opposes this standardisation as , in our view , such a statute should remain under the remit of each country .
Finally , we will need real solidarity around a Budget that it will not be possible to confine , as some would have us do , within the meagre envelope of 1 % of GNP .
One can understand that Heads of State and Government are preoccupied with the sensitivities of their own public opinions and Parliaments .
At Nice , the European Council is due to adopt several decisions , which I shall now discuss .
Let it come to Parliament to present its ideas .
A major question remains unanswered , however .
As for the negotiations with the WTO , I can assure you that recognition of the European quality systems remains firmly on the Commission &amp; apos ; s agenda .
Today , we have an agreement on a boost to the economy of around 1.5 % of the EU &amp; apos ; s GDP , as the Commission recommended .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is convinced that powerful institutional reform , adapted to the requirements of enlargement , can be achieved before the end of 2000 .
Mr President , problems of instability persist in Madagascar despite the initiatives of the African Union and the UN .
. - Mr President , I am going to try to respond very quickly to the various interventions made , which , broadly speaking , seemed to me to be along the same lines and to express similar views .
Perhaps we should now get down to the business of politics .
However , I am afraid that it may also be unfair in that it is based exclusively on the situation in main@@ land Europe and does not give sufficient consideration to the diversity of regional situations , particularly as regards production in the outermost regions .
The Council would do better not to approve Article 1 of this decision in view of the Parliament &amp; apos ; s opinion . This House would have been better advised to follow the opinion of its Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which should ultimately have been responsible here .
Nevertheless , by proposing definitions of intellectual property rights , and by introducing a restrictive definition of &amp; apos ; commercial scale &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; intentional infringement &amp; apos ; , the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s Committee on Legal Affairs is undermining the principle of subsidiarity in criminal matters and is challenging the acquis communautaire on this matter .
One cannot put off taking decisions forever , otherwise it will be too late , hence the need to create an international environmental organisation , which today seems not only necessary but urgent too , since its role , under the auspices of the UN , will be to oversee the application of the commitments made in Copenhagen .
Today I am proud of the European Union and proud of its opposition to the United States &amp; quot ; amendment , when it tried to restrict the right to abortion at the UN last week .
Finally , allow me to say a word about Turkey .
Madam President , Chancellor , Mr Santer , I must say that we are delighted to see you once again , Mr Santer .
This being the case , we will not support the report drafted by Mr Trentin , whom I greatly admire . We will consider instead Mr García @-@ Margallo Margallo y Marfil &amp; apos ; s report .
It is sometimes necessary to be selective , in order to focus our resources where they can really produce the best results .
On a large number of points , the Council had already followed Parliament &amp; quot ; s recommendations at first reading .
One is all the more surprised when one reads the triumph@@ alist report on the Schengen system , which has been laid before us today .
There is somewhat of a danger that we will take this draft Community regulation as a kind of hostage against the financial decisions to be taken at Member State level .
In conclusion , ladies and gentlemen , in order to respect the precautionary principle in both spirit and letter , should the articles and amendments which I have just mentioned not be withdrawn , then , as the wine growers themselves demand , we would have to fall in with the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin , and the Committee on the Environment , and vote against them .
I wish to add three observations to this statement .
Israel must be guaranteed its security , and the people of Gaza must have a guarantee that they will be able to live in peace in the future .
Firstly , the Commission has proposed communi@@ tising - i.e. introducing by means of qualified majority voting in the Council without ratification by the national parliaments - international trade negotiations on services and intellectual property , a possibility indeed already opened by Article 132 ( 5 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Commissioner , you are proceeding with the utmost caution , and that is an approach which I support .
I support the proposal for a series of procedural guarantees to strengthen the rights of persons judged in abs@@ enti@@ a , and the efforts to eliminate different approaches towards &amp; apos ; grounds for non @-@ recognition recognition &amp; apos ; of such decisions .
We must be sure of what we want .
I am in agreement with nearly all that has been said on this matter .
The initial evaluation , and that carried out after five years , provide the opportunity to weigh up the added therapeutic value of medicinal products .
We were somewhat concerned about certain aspects of the strategic document presented by the Austrian Presidency and , in our view , it was vital that the report should set out these concerns very clearly .
Madam President , Mr Solana , Commissioner , I take part in this debate with certain reservations because I do not want this Parliament giving the impression that it is sitting in judgment , cas@@ ting ana@@ them@@ a on this or that person when , after such great hopes were raised here only a month ago , we face the dramatic consequences of this new explosion of violence in the Middle East .
We think the time has come to take this work to a more political level by combining all the information available to us .
I believe , and everyone is convinced of it today , that the euro is our greatest capital , our best investment .
I have to say that we also very much welcome the emphasis which has been placed by the ECOFIN Council on measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances .
There are too many uncertain factors weighing on the negotiations for the EU to set itself such restrictive objectives .
We shall therefore first vote on whether to put this compromise amendment to the vote .
I think the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council clarified matters greatly as to the method followed by the Four@@ teen , specifically asking Parliament not to consider voting to allow the contacts currently taking place between the foreign affairs ministers to achieve a result .
The European Union , the Council and the Commission must stay in contact with those involved , the SADC , the African Union , and also South Africa - and once again I should like to welcome the South African delegation here with us today - and of course we shall also have to take into account the resolution which Parliament will be voting on tomorrow , in the work which the Council will be doing .
I would like to look to the future by emphasising three points , which I do not believe can be ignored .
Vo@@ ting in favour of this step is a challenge for the future and a challenge for the respect for human rights . For these challenges to be met , there is a need for education and specific training that can be obtained by participating in these programmes and in exchanges .
At Lisbon , the EU also set itself the goal of becoming , by the same date , the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge @-@ based based economy in the world .
Instead of swe@@ aring by the market alone , we should favour cooperation , such as exists within the organisation for air safety , Eurocontrol .
Armed with the opinion of Parliament and that of the Council , I would then have to present the nomination of these coordinators that I sincerely hope for to the College of the Commission .
In brief , this directive is coming at the right time .
I think this is something that needs to be said .
I hope that you will treat this as a possibility to develop more synergy , to strengthen our common voice - the voice of all three actors - and to give more democratic and parliamentary legitimacy to our common goal which is : foreign policy ; one voice ; European Union .
In particular , neither the Commission nor the Council agreed to the dual legal basis that we were demanding .
The Treaty of Lisbon grants the EU new prerogatives , confirms the development of its international capacity and puts new tools in place .
We are highly sceptical about this whole anti @-@ mis@@ sile mis@@ sile defence strategy , but we firmly believe it is something that we Europeans are duty @-@ bound bound to discuss .
Similarly , the reference to Article 168 of the Treaty was necessary in order to ensure that the prerogatives of the Member States in terms of organising their public health systems were respected .
We realise that no report and no vote , even by the European Parliament , can alter this situation .
Once again , this honourable Assembly is inviting the presidency of the Council to discuss relations between Cuba and the European Union .
How , in this case , can we enable the citizens concerned to recognise the added value of the European Union ?
They have produced a text that is close to the European Commission &amp; apos ; s basic proposal which , in my opinion , is on the whole quite satisfactory .
In accordance with the results of this work , the Commission will issue a communication before next summer .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mrs Prets , I have listened quite carefully to what our Commissioner has said .
It is quite clear that in all this , Albania , in particular , must implement the existing framework for combating organised crime and corruption .
Like 3@@ 81 of my fellow Members , I supported Mr Barroso &amp; apos ; s appointment as head of the Commission .
That is a considerable increase in online trade and online advertising tools .
Lastly , the Commission welcomes the amendment , which was tabled in plenary by the rapporteur , to set up an implementing agency .
I have duly noted the EP &amp; apos ; s request to the Commission and Council to adopt a framework decision on minimum standards for the protection of the rights of prisoners and to create a European prison charter .
A changes in the Community approach to the problems in those regions has been slow .
I know that Parliament would like to have not only an advisory role but also responsibility for the decision itself .
The agenda is , of course , in keeping with the Lisbon conclusions and the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights , to ensure its effective implementation .
Members of the rapid intervention teams will be able to exercise all of the powers necessary to carry out the activities of checking or monitoring the borders .
In this way , the European Union reconciles its wish to increase its attractiveness with its faith@@ fulness to commitments to promote the development of the poorest countries .
Although I understand and respect the idea of transparency that underlies these amendments , I wonder about the practical applic@@ ability of such proposals .
I am in favour of this and support the demand that the Commission should draw up a precise and rigorous timetable for this .
Our group has had the opportunity to express its disagreement on several occasions on two points in particular .
For those companies that have chosen to maintain production safeguarding know @-@ how how and employment in Europe , this regulation will re @-@ establish establish a level playing field with our third @-@ country country trading partners .
Given my desire to avoid entering into an argument on this point , however , I shall begin by stressing the following point : regardless of the usefulness of the European Women &amp; quot ; s Lobby , if some Members - and I agree with the previous speaker here - are calling for the extension of the programme for women , it is because they know from their dialogue with the relevant associations that the main problem lies in the way they work .
So there was a misunderstanding over the voting instructions .
Solidarity remains a fundamental part of European integration , and I should like to speak in this Chamber about solidarity between employers and employees .
Once again , I believe that the first lesson to be learnt for the future is that we must follow the Commission in its Community approach .
That is why I voted in favour of this report , which focuses on health and therefore the protection of consumers .
We thus welcome the statements that have been made on behalf of the European Commission .
The Commission seems to be realising it for the first time , and we could be surprised .
The answer to these challenges lies in the new economy of ageing , in inven@@ ting a new human planning sector with new diplomas for ger@@ i@@ atri@@ c assistants and new branches of medicine and associated professions .
As we have already said , it is essential that if a representative of a Member State goes to Minsk , he or she should meet with the opposition .
This will clearly have consequences for the countries concerned .
It is therefore necessary to reinforce our coordination and common action .
I hope that , during the next parliamentary term , at second reading , we shall be able to reverse this state of affairs in order to create a real European asylum law guaranteeing real protection for these particularly vulnerable men and women .
on services : protecting the right of every country to continue to regulate its public services .
Madam President , I would like to request that the vote on the legislative resolution be postponed , pursuant to Rule 60 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
I wish to finish , Madam President , by thanking the shadow rapporteurs , who were of great assistance to me in this task , for the large number of compromises we were able to achieve .
We are convinced that a lasting solution needs to be based on an agreement between the National Council for Peace and Development and the elected democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities .
In short , here we have a simple , innovative , democratic procedure .
The implementation of the entire programme is necessary , as is a strong political will to step up efforts .
Mr President , to save the Chamber &amp; apos ; s time and in order to take the rapporteur , Mr Linkohr &amp; apos ; s , wishes into account , I propose a single vote on the annex and we will thus know immediately where we are , for this annex also requires a qualified majority .
I am convinced that the Commission , the Council and Parliament itself will not be able to ignore the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union when acting , in future , in a legislative or executive capacity .
Since then - as we have seen - problems persist and people need to be aware of these .
I voted in favour of Mr B@@ run@@ etta &amp; apos ; s report with these added clarifications .
He is satisfied with the way that these guidelines are working .
Mr President , I am not speaking as one of the authors of the motion , because the Group of the Greens does not support this compromise proposal .
Secondly , tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed with all that ensu@@ es in terms of social difficulties and misery .
The simple fact is , though , that the necessity of reaffirming such elementary truths as that the disabled are human beings itself demonstrates how far this is from being obvious in this inhumane society .
Yet the European Parliament and the Commission genuinely attach vast significance to it .
To ask them to organize a referendum which envisages the election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage , as the paragraph in the compromise resolution proposes , is clearly interference on the part of the European Parliament in Slovak internal affairs .
I should like to say that my group supports the proposal presented by the Commission and the Council to enhance the European Union &amp; quot ; s civilian intervention capacities .
This is why we should vote in favour of Amendment No 77 and Amendment No 1 .
It has a duty to explore coherent and courageous courses of action .
That being the case , we must agree on how to react , when exchanges with non @-@ partner partner countries are subject to presum@@ ptions of il@@ legality .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we voted in favour of Mr Böge &amp; apos ; s reports on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , thinking , above all , of those workers being made redundant .
I am grateful to the Commissioner , who has shown himself to be determined to ensure that the European directive is implemented , rather than just being discussed .
I find this regrettable , as do many of my colleagues .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by our colleague Mrs Ojala critic@@ ally examines two types of document .
It also seems essential that , in combination with the determination to reduce irregular@@ ity and fraud effectively , the reform should be able to look into the implementation of our policies within Member States , where one of the problems arising concerns payment deadlines and the inadequacy of some payment appropriations .
This is indeed a very , very serious hour and a European initiative is urgently required .
Commissioner , thank you for your answer , although I think it is slightly el@@ u@@ sive .
This means that this crisis will give us the opportunity to increase investment in social Europe and in a Europe of reform .
E@@ conom@@ ically , this kind of protection offers no prospects , given that the European economy is de facto integrated in the world market .
I notice , however , and I am not alone , that there is currently no unanimity . I note in particular that the United Kingdom is systematically aligning itself with the United States , which consequently considerably undermines any initiatives we might be called upon to take .
They also decided to act in accordance with the Council of Europe Declaration , Programme of Action and Resolution on democratisation , conflict prevention and peace @-@ building building .
Yesterday the entire Left in this House violently opposed the Barcelona proposal that it would be worthwhile and necessary for many more people over the age of 50 to work .
The reason why we do not agree with your amendments , as Mrs Palacio has explained , is because this is not the place to include them .
To do that , it has , over the years , adopted legislation that is regularly revised and applicable in the Union .
Madam President , many things have already been said , but I would like to echo all the words of sympathy and support that have already been addressed to the peoples of Tunisia and Egypt .
As you know , the European Union is concerned about situations involving discrimination throughout the world ; therefore it was natural that we also express this concern .
The prompt conclusion of this work is dependent on both the services of Parliament and also those of all Member States .
The Burmese government has promised a democratic transition in seven stages , ultimately leading up to elections .
In accordance with the Lisbon objectives , it is essential to develop information technologies and , among those , broadband .
This will have to be clarified later but , for the moment , it would indeed be a relief if France did not ratify the Amsterdam Treaty .
So , if we want to be able to govern and decide matters , then decisions must be taken by a qualified majority , including those on non @-@ discrimination discrimination .
The only way to prevent democracy being diluted in the future , to avoid the impression of no longer controlling anything , is to increase the involvement of the national parliaments in the European decision @-@ making making process by giving them a genuine right to say &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; or &amp; apos ; no &amp; apos ; to their countries taking part in this or that decision .
The Commission understands and also shares the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s desire to eliminate any restriction in the article providing for equality of treatment and , turning to the Presidency , I obviously hope that , as far as possible , the Council will prove open to all of these amendments .
Once again , in France , a number of measures have been implemented , which have been more or less understood , but I am convinced that it is essential to be extremely vigilant and to apply the precautionary principle .
On the other hand , I am still looking for concrete proposals in this report that will enable this objective to be achieved .
The abolition of the death penalty , or at least the introduction of a moratorium on its application , China &amp; quot ; s swift ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and cooperation with the United Nations &amp; quot ; mechanisms also feature among the priority issues regularly addressed with the Chinese authorities .
This fund will make it possible to back the loans granted by the European Investment Bank and other European development banks , especially in the transport , energy and environment sectors .
It is also necessary that the peace @-@ keeping keeping force - regarding which an agreement in principle had been reached at Ar@@ us@@ ha - should be ready to intervene and , it must be said , should intervene at once .
We should like to apply sanctions to those principally responsible , which - as the report makes clear - are the Council and certain national governments , first among them the British Government .
The European Union &amp; apos ; s regional policy is one of the most useful policies for our fellow citizens .
In conjunction with its allies , the European Union will examine all possible means of preventing such acts and of responding to them in an appropriate manner .
These are the real questions .
Let us therefore be prudent , rather than naive or compli@@ cit in a further genocide .
I am convinced that this will be one of the highlights of this European Council bringing the French Presidency to an end .
One Member State on its own cannot establish an effective system .
We need growth ; we need to boost demand , and it is not by bringing our fellow citizens to their knees that we will achieve this .
The review of this policy must be accompanied by the introduction of a set of political criteria that neighbouring countries should meet in order to obtain a superior status in their relations with the EU .
Well , this is not what this is about .
Nu@@ mer@@ ous safeguards have been put in place .
It is also , and this is even more important , a more political budget , since we have - as Mrs Guy @-@ Quint Quint calls it - interinstitutional strategic programming , in other words , all of the bodies of the European Union agree to bring the budget into being .
What is more , the Commission rejects the unfounded statements relating to the previous decisions , which were taken after in @-@ depth depth and detailed investigations had been carried out and after all the parties concerned had been invited , via the publication of an opinion in the Official Jour@@ n@@ al , to share their comments .
The political will of the Fifteen Member States is essential .
I also think that the European Union has the specific ability to combine these various instruments and that what we must do , if this policy progresses and becomes consolidated , is to develop a genuine European culture of conflict prevention and management .
I am concerned about that and I urge the French Presidency to be concerned about it .
However , the publication of this document encourages me to look to the near future and the preparation of an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
In the face of these developments , the international community is mobilising .
However , much remains to be done to prevent discrimination .
This is essential if we are to have a real social Europe alongside the internal market , in which competition plays the leading role .
What is lacking is the political will , which is a crucial factor for peace and completely non @-@ existent existent today .
We think , on the contrary , that it is majority voting that would be impossible , because national interests and realities would be so divergent in a Europe of 27 members .
Tra@@ gic abuses , such as slavery , human trafficking or coloni@@ alism must be condemned in no uncertain terms .
Funding for this research must be guaranteed , for example through European Investment Bank funds .
Ser@@ ious crime must also form one aspect of this judicial cooperation that we truly want .
In this time of financial crisis , the most vulnerable people , especially the unemployed and young people , have been the worst affected .
I shall vote against this hypocritical report , which I condemn .
The European Union is one of the largest distributors of economic aid throughout the world .
Apart from being useless and a waste of resources , the EU &amp; apos ; s accession to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will lead to confusion and un@@ resol@@ v@@ able legal conflicts with the Strasbourg Court .
That is where we need the wisdom to be able to strike a balance between the need to find alternatives to tests on animals and the need to give priority to public health .
Thus , there are some misunderstandings that I would like to try to clear up .
This is a genuine flaw in European democracy .
The final point is that the European Union does not invest enough , and this is a personal proposal : is it not time that we included a section on investments in our budget and that , in association with the European Investment Bank - of which I propose that , henceforth , since we have legal personality , the European Union becomes a partner , alongside the Member States - we had an investment plan , notably on trans @-@ European European networks ?
We agree with you on this issue , and we sometimes detected a slight difference of approach to that adopted by the President of the Commission . We hope that he will be equally clear in his statements , especially with regard to social issues .
It is this concept of common interest between Europe and Turkey that led us to submit essential amendments to this House , in collaboration with our German friends .
The second element is without doubt the need to strengthen good governance .
The Commission is giving itself the role of arbitra@@ tor .
There , Commissioner , you have a number of points on which it must be possible to work during the legislative period that is about to start .
Third , we must bring all our influence to bear on international trade negotiations to ensure that the right to agricultural exception , i.e. , a nation &amp; apos ; s right to protect the farmers that provide its food , is recognised .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s communication is entitled , &amp; apos ; Europe &amp; apos ; s response to World A@@ geing - promoting economic and social progress in an ageing world &amp; apos ; .
We are told today that Iraq is dividing the European Union .
We need a Commission that delivers on its promises .
This Commission is worthy of your confidence and deserves your support .
Ukraine &amp; apos ; s commendable intention to close the Chernobyl power station quite obviously deserves international and , in particular , European aid , but that must not allow us to forget the suffering of the Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ an people since the terrible accident at the Ukrainian power station .
Mr President , I would like some clarification .
in writing . - I voted for the report by Mr Toubon on the Single Market Review and I support the positive approach of the rapporteur to one of the most important pillars of the European Union .
And an adequate minimum income for everyone in Europe is clearly one of those means .
We want to bring the electorate and its representatives closer together and it is proposed to establish a transnational European list .
That being said , I am a lawyer and , quite honestly , I do not see how this debate can be held here , when it should have been held first at the Assembly of the Council of Europe and in our national parliaments .
With regard to self @-@ regulation regulation and co @-@ regulation regulation - paragraph 20 of the report - I agree with the rapporteur that greater emphasis should be placed on co @-@ regulation regulation .
You are therefore absolutely right .
I am delighted that the European Parliament supports the ambitious approach proposed by the Commission .
We do not have the right to sit back and allow ethnic cleansing out of cowardice .
It is therefore our duty to say &amp; apos ; that is enough &amp; quot ; , that we will not tolerate any more such acts of violence , that these horrendous attitudes are contrary to our values and the foundations upon which we have built our Europe .
I am thinking , for example of the Belgian government &amp; apos ; s lack of transparency in aler@@ ting the European Commission so late , and of the lack of information which was given to consumers .
The amendments make positive changes to the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal , so that the socio @-@ economic economic dimension of the fishing industry is no longer forgotten .
Admittedly , this report has the merit of providing an insight into the immen@@ sity of the task that awaits us if we wish , not even to bring the candidate countries of Eastern Europe up to the level of development of the West , but simply to establish conditions for peaceful coexistence and a gradual rapprochement between the two areas that would not be too destabilising for either side .
Mr President , at a time when the crossing points into the Gaza Strip are closed and are controlled by the Israeli army , at a time when murderous incur@@ sions are being conducted there on a daily basis , at a time when the number of sett@@ lers in the occupied territories is continuing to grow , at a time when , in violation of international law , the construction of the wall and security surveillance are continuing , within these very walls , in the European Parliament , there are still people who would deny Israel &amp; apos ; s status as an occupying power .
That is what our citizens expect when pension systems , which are the real pri@@ zes of the European social model , are in danger .
This is , in any event , the result of the questionnaire that I sent to you at the time , to which most members of the delegation replied , and I count on your active support to promote what is , in my view , our common agenda .
How will the agricultural Europe , reformed in this way , be able to defend its political project for agriculture and rural development in the future WTO negotiations ?
I welcome the agreement between our two institutions on items so politically sensitive in both Europe and the United States .
I therefore ask that the debate should take place .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I feel that it would be useful to briefly add to what was very rightly said by our colleague Mr Spencer concerning the particular request that Parliament has made with regard to someone who was under its protection , D@@ r I@@ bra@@ him Ru@@ go@@ va .
The political situation may well change , and I should like to add that the European Union is making every effort to make its presence felt in the country , as , a few days ago , a European Commission office was set up in Belarus .
We must be a proactive force , we must be a decisive force .
We must be a role model .
This draft has already made good progress and had the full backing of the European Parliament .
Here we succeeded , although it is an extremely sensitive and complex issue .
They are criminals who are pre@@ aching to the victims of their own criminal action .
I am unable to agree with my group regarding its position on Mr van Dam &amp; apos ; s amendment , which I , personally , chose to support .
The Member States have already given their backing to all of these ideas .
Moreover , Rule 8 of the Council &amp; apos ; s Rules of Procedure provides for the organisation of public debates .
This situation was predictable though , ladies and gentlemen .
For years , we have been talking about creating a single permit for third @-@ country country nationals who wish to live and work in a Member State .
The Commission has made known its intention to table draft directives - but when will these be approved ?
Lastly , these crops have an essential role to play at an ag@@ ron@@ omic and environmental level .
As usual , it is the poorest people who will suffer from our legislative whims .
I am convinced that our reforms are starting to bring about change , and the next Commission needs to go even further .
It is unacceptable for the European Union to pursue this policy aiming to make our neighbours take on the role of policing our borders .
It is the first step in a series of changes required to establish a credible economic government .
That tells you something about the quality of the positive work done by Parliament : it should be congratulated .
Indeed , the extremely serious nature of the debt crisis must lead to a complete overhaul of European public finances .
It is also true that we should have a meeting at a later stage in order to address all those important questions .
That is how it appears to me , though I could be wrong .
This morning , our debate was devoted to what is now commonly called the &amp; apos ; energy and climate change package &amp; apos ; , a political package containing a key objective set by the leaders of the 27 countries in March 2007 .
I think that it should be very much on our minds .
Furthermore , it is not so much the current legislative framework that is causing most problems , but rather the differences between the Member States in their interpretation and implementation of the directives .
At best we might expect it to be ratified next year .
I would be very pleased if the Commissioner could answer this point .
I will come back to that in connection with the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy .
The aim is firstly to reduce the number of fa@@ ta@@ lities and injuries on Europe &amp; apos ; s roads , because it is a real disaster and tragedy that unfolds every year before our eyes .
I should like to propose , in this House , that the President of Parliament invite the new Speaker of the House of Representatives to speak in plenary .
In that sense , it deserves strong EU support , in the context of promoting trans @-@ European European networks and regional policy .
Yet that is what we need : harmonisation which increases the level of protection .
Of course , my thanks go both to your two rapporteurs , Mr Mastorakis and Mr Pomés Ruiz , to whom I have listened attentively , and to each and every one of you .
It will need meticulous preparation , and we shall do that .
The cohesion between all the reform sectors should assure the people of Europe that the methods by which European integration is managed politically are clearly visible and truly transparent .
Europe does not exist or , to be entirely accurate , Europe has failed to provide itself with the wherewithal to be present and active . It carries no weight in any of these crises .
So , what is in the negotiating programme proposed by the European Union ?
In the spirit of compromise , we support the rapporteur &amp; quot ; s stand in bringing in only one amendment that was not adopted by the common position .
The European Union must , indeed , be aware of its own stake in the future of the Korean peninsu@@ lar .
Almost 10 years after the Western coalition dro@@ ve the Talib@@ an from power , peace and prosperity are still far from being a daily reality for Afghans .
I feel that the plenary is within its rights to state its opinion on the position adopted by the Conference of Presidents .
The work of this group was what led the Council to adopt two important decisions which I would like to remind you of .
Firstly , I am very grateful to all of the speakers .
S@@ tarting , therefore , with the questions put by Mrs Boumediene @-@ Thiery Thiery , I will try to reply to the questions of the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
However , let us not del@@ ude ourselves .
Parliament is right to call the Council and the Commission and the United States to account .
This is a welcome development but all the same , I am against , Mr President .
I must say a word , Mr Watson , about the number of Commissioners .
And the framework to be implemented must of course include a proper evaluation system for each region , especially proper management and disciplinary systems , as well as the principle of responsible decentralisation .
My group regrets the fact that once an agreement had been reached on a joint resolution , two political groups thought it necessary to table amendments restoring passages to the joint resolution which had been removed .
I gave my full support to the resolution tabled by my colleague , Mr Cashman , in order to call on the Commission and the Council to review the rules on access to European institutional documents , in accordance with the clauses on transparency laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
Minister , Commissioner , we must continue to adopt an ambitious approach on these issues .
The fact that the results obtained are of good quality is really due to the fact that this is the product of policy work in which Parliament and the Council played an important part .
This is precisely the issue that we , Members of the European Parliament , have been fighting for : to obtain the same level of guarantee , that is , a prior procedure before an impartial judge .
Nothing will be resolved in the Middle East if no solution is found to this conflict with the support of the entire international community , including the Arab countries , the Palestinians and , of course , Israel and the United States .
Those who vote against our reasonable proposals tomorrow will have difficulty in explaining this backward step to our compatriots .
They will generate greater clarity in our debates , and greater transparency in the way in which political life is funded .
The common and shared objective is now to enable the development of a Community action which will contribute to the construction of Europe from the roots up , calling on the personal initiative of our youth regardless of their social , cultural or educational situation .
I have therefore voted in favour of this text .
At last , the Commission has given us some ambitious goals for Roma integration in Europe : guaranteeing at least a primary level of education for all Roma children , reducing child mortality and closing life expectancy gaps .
In the context of the debates in the run @-@ up up to Nice , I personally was concerned to meet with national parliaments and , quite frankly , I do not regret it at all .
I for@@ got to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments , as I have already done , not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ .
That is why the Commission should carry out a thorough assessment of the media situation in each candidate country and in each Member State .
I believe that this action is effective , but that there is still a long way to go .
It is Turkey &amp; quot ; s joining the EU that will finally mean that the political minorities - the non @-@ attached attached Members - are respected within the European Parliament ...
... measures which the Commission and Parliament can , in fact , take jointly .
Finally , I support Parliament &amp; quot ; s request to the European Commission that specific measures be proposed within the framework of protecting sp@@ a water .
After more than two years of prevaric@@ ation , the Council finally adopted in October 1999 a common position on the directive relating to co@@ co@@ a and cho@@ col@@ ate products .
The maintenance of direct aid , which is an essential element : it has been proven that no economy in the world lets its farmers make a decent living without financial support .
It is now the task of Parliament to deliver a completely independent opinion on the outcome of this work .
Def@@ ending universal values more rob@@ us@@ tly means having to work within the competent international organisations as closely as possible with third countries .
Agriculture must play a key part , and the new CAP must be radically reformed and account taken of the requirements of sustainable development .
I should like to thank Mr MacCormick of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and all of you for your contributions , as well as for your contributions to the debate this evening .
The success of this Agreement reflects the European Union &amp; apos ; s clear and mutual interest in concluding partnership agreements , notably in the fisheries sector .
The European Parliament &amp; quot ; s resolution on the constitutional process and the preparations for the European Council of 25 to 26 March 2004 practi@@ ses the usual blackmail that we have seen in the case of each treaty , whereby it is proclaimed that an absence of agreement would have harmful repercussions for both integration and enlargement and would entail &amp; apos ; a devastating loss of solidarity and legitimacy &amp; quot ; .
The European Union must now show the political courage to make new and bold choices .
I want to stress two points .
I really hope that tomorrow we will all live up to the expectations of European citizens and show that we are safeguarding the protection of human rights and the values of the European Union .
Aid to Mediterranean countries must be provided quickly and efficiently , in line with the European Union &amp; apos ; s political priorities .
So I expect the Commission , together with the EA@@ SA , to be able to submit specific proposals in the very near future , which will be integrated fully in the implementation of the Single European Sky .
This phase is essential for a fair and lasting settlement of the conflict .
Otherwise , once again , for year after year , we shall be fighting , talking away endlessly about the Constitution , and consequently losing even more the support of the citizens of the European Union .
Once again , as we have already said , the European Union and the Member States must make their actions consistent with their statements .
After this un@@ successful motion of censure , this backing down , there will be no more motions of censure .
The proposals that have been put forward fall far short of what the problem requires .
I would also like to say that we have endeavoured to work in tandem with the President of the Commission , each being aware of our own responsibilities , and , to do him justice , the Presidency could never have achieved the results it did without working hand in hand with President Barroso .
The Commission proposal to eliminate animal matter which cannot be consumed by humans from animal feed must also be implemented .
The Commission committed itself to submitting to the European Parliament and the Council the results and the proposals that would emerge from this study .
Our people expect more Europe , but not just any Europe .
On behalf of the Parliament , I expect the Commission to take up the requirements mentioned above , since they are essential to our political objectives of clarity , transparency and equity .
The health of European consumers must be a top priority in all decisions that are adopted .
Finally , I totally support the idea of having the European Union step in to help those regions that , after having gone through restructuring processes , must move into new economic areas .
And that implementation must be properly balanced between the needs of the professionals and the need for transparency , and strict control of public expenditure . In particular , Mr Perry , it must respect the financial regulation .
In this report in particular , which sought to assess the implementation of the programmes , the European Parliament drew up an assessment and highlighted the successes , difficulties and possible solutions .
The founding statute of the Court claims that the Court shall only intervene on a subsidiary basis , in cases where the Member States refuse to exercise their sovereign right or are not in a position to do so .
In this way , the European Union , which embarked on the process of monitoring the Durban conference on racism in 2001 , will be extremely careful that this process does not lead to texts that have already been negotiated and adopted being re@@ visited , or to concepts , such as the def@@ amation of religions , being recognised , to the detriment of freedom of expression .
It is not therefore up to the Council to state an opinion on this matter .
In conclusion , may I say on behalf of our Group that the Council has the final say on so @-@ called called compulsory expenditure .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am not going to reiterate what has already been said .
Mr President , Secretary @-@ General General , in its resolution of 22 October 2001 on the reform of the Council , the European Parliament expressed the opinion that the proper operation of the Council is essential in order to guarantee the democracy , efficacy and coherence of the decision @-@ making making process in the enlarged Union .
firstly , I would like studies to be carried out on the establishment of a federal &amp; quot ; water and environment &amp; quot ; management system in the various countries at European Union level ,
European money must arrive quickly on the ground in order to assist victims at the time when they need it most .
It is only through solidarity and passion with regard to enlargement that we will find the solutions to the more difficult issues .
As regards the construction of passenger and mer@@ chant vessels , both highly competitive , labour @-@ intensive intensive sectors , here too the Member States &amp; apos ; remarkable expertise and outstanding capabilities must be protected and developed and not allowed to go outside Europe .
This effort has its limits unless it is shared by Parliament and the Council , whose demands largely shape the Commission &amp; apos ; s programme of work .
We expect ambitious decisions from the European Council in order to achieve this .
That is why I call on Parliament to follow the unanimous example of the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs and quite simply to reject outright the initiatives of the Republic of Finland and the Republic of Portugal .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my serious concern regarding the first reading of this report that we are to debate today , even in spite of the remarkable work that Mr Meijer has done . We also support most of the amendments that he has tabled .
Confronted with these two challenges , there are some arguing in favour of the all @-@ nuclear nuclear solution , while others are arguing in favour of completely giving up nuclear power .
This proposal , combined with maintaining the Commission &amp; apos ; s monopoly of initiative , would ultimately end , as we know , in a considerable strengthening of the Commission &amp; apos ; s powers and a concomitant reduction in the rights of States .
This seems unacceptable to me , as any future consultation of the European Parliament on this issue would then be impossible .
How can we speak of managing immigration in a more humane manner , how can we hope and pray for further integration , if we do not question its foundations ?
And what of public health ?
The European Union and its Member States will act in support of the WHO .
All legislation on employment and working conditions is a matter for the Member States , and I support the amendments which strengthen the principle of subsidiarity .
Indeed , the European Union must spread a strong political message to fight against public expressions of racism or hatred .
Indeed , the European Union involves more than just the export of goods and services .
The phrase in Article 20 to the effect that there is a lack of the necessary political will for integration among certain Member States is more likely to be perceived as aggressive than as an attempt at persuasion .
In this regard , I am sure that Parliament will confirm the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
It was time for a well thought @-@ out out text that provides a general political declaration on humanitarian aid for our three institutions .
Commissioner , this proposal for a regulation , which is designed to simplify existing legislation , is entirely within the framework of sustainable development , quite simply because it concerns an environmental issue , an issue which might also be related to public health and consumer policy .
These two extra years should therefore be used for in @-@ depth depth discussion on the European Union &amp; apos ; s cooperation with local players in developing countries and their contribution to sustainable development .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Reul &amp; apos ; s report is a very good and thorough report and I congratulate him on it .
This is a huge issue , Mr President , and I strongly encourage my fellow Members to choose Eurojust instead , as this could achieve the same results without the problems of destabilisation .
I think it should be defined according to the research projects in question .
However , clearly none of the Member States has yet exchanged instruments of ratification , to put it in diplomatic terms .
We also stated in that text that this opportunity for a certain proportion of European MPs to be elected from European lists would make the organisation of European parties and their role easier .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I shall use the mother tongue of our rapporteur in order to congratulate and to thank him for his meticulous work and for the outcome of that work : the excellent report that we are going to adopt tomorrow .
We face demographic challenges , as you said , and we face many economic challenges , given the reality of globalisation , of technology .
That is why our Parliament wishes , within the framework of the codecision process , to be fully involved in taking the decision on the definitive form to be taken by the Council .
That is why our report on the report from the Commission does indeed have a purpose .
The three institutions responsible for legislative activity share responsibility for preventing these framework laws from entering into too much detail .
This political gesture would probably be as powerful as the reunification of Germany was in its day , and it would show the solidarity that exists within Europe and would increase the influence of our Union .
I am delighted to see that , in the resolution , the European Union &amp; apos ; s anti @-@ drug drug strategy has a place in the creation of this European judicial area .
However , I should like to return to the realities .
The reign of irresponsibility and impunity must be brought to an end .
It is not , therefore , surprising that there is , in this context , no real integration or genuine political dialogue .
Recommendation for second reading ( A5 @-@ 01@@ 73 01@@ 73 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the Council common position with a view to adopting European Parliament and Council directive 2000 / ... / EC amending Council Directive 91 / 4@@ 40 / EEC on the development of the Community &amp; apos ; s railways ( 5@@ 3@@ 86 / 1 / 2000 - C5 @-@ 01@@ 78 01@@ 78 / 2000 - 1998 / 02@@ 65 ( COD ) ) ( rapporteur : Mr Jarzembowski )
However , in order to progress , industrialists need a clear framework of reference provided by the European Union and the Member States under the CFSP .
Is it in fact reasonable to think that the demand for energy , the corollary of development , can be satisfied by renewable energies in countries like India and China ?
In my view , we have taken a decision on this system and whether right or wrong , it is a decision nonetheless .
These provisions appear in the Draft Statute which was adopted .
As a result , the Commission urges the Member States to adopt a more ambitious approach when future proposals are submitted to them in this area .
I reiterate that this group suggested - or indicated in any case - to the Commission , and in particular to the Vice @-@ President President charged with reform , that the path that the Commission recommended was not the correct path and was not the path that Parliament advised .
Similarly , with the prospect of the future membership of eastern and central European states to the Union , it is essential that the candidates for membership accept the current regulations applied to public procurement contracts within a reasonable period of time .
Is it not now time to present the 15 Member States with a set of measures leading towards a common vision , across all of Europe , of the conditions concerning both asylum and the status of refugees ?
We must listen to public opinion .
I shall end , Mr President , by expressing my desire for this plenary to endorse the practically unanimous support of the respective committees for the reports by Mr Bullmann and Mr Andersson .
The European Parliament itself got on with things quite quickly , as did the Commission , by making a proposal according to a timetable enabling the Council to come to a decision before 30 June .
In fact , I believe that we have contraven@@ ed our Rules of Procedure .
Thus , if the vote on the resolution can be taken during the first October part @-@ session session , we agree to the oral question with debate being included in this Thursday &amp; apos ; s agenda .
It is our credibility that is at stake here .
I also think it would be good for the Commission to report to Parliament on this subject in 2012 .
In order for there to be an election there needs to be several candidates and a democratic process .
That is our main task .
We are , fortunately , moving towards self @-@ assertion assertion .
I can only approve of the measures proposed .
The second level is that of the national authorities .
The scale of the challenges implies the need for long @-@ term term policies .
Nuclear energy or fossil energy : you may favour one over the other , but you cannot rule them both out .
It should not be forgotten , however , that the Commission gains its strength from the collegiality it embodies , which is enshrined in the Treaties and which forms part of the history and beliefs of the Commission .
I would not presume to lecture the House on the many objectives contained in existing and draft treaties .
It is an important tool and the Commission will do everything necessary to ensure this tool is used effectively .
We agree , too , with your recommendation that the export of fishing vessels to third countries should no longer be financed : as you are aware , we suggested this in our reform proposal .
It is up to the candidate countries to make the necessary efforts to achieve this , and it is up to us to assist them and also to make ourselves ready to accept them .
We want to see respect for human rights , beginning with the rights to asylum , freedom of movement and freedom of establishment .
Personally I hope these sanctions - which would not have been necessary if the monitoring systems had been effective - will be tough but fair and balanced .
The Commission has made this commitment and it is included in the statement that I have submitted to the Presidency .
This regulation setting up a European Food Authority will , I hope , help to restore the confidence of European consumers .
I should also like to point out and to endorse the very clear increase in appropriations earmarked for funding measures to combat and prevent discrimination . This has been a priority of the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole since the Treaty of Amsterdam .
In parallel , economic cooperation with Israel must continue in full and , of course , it must be accelerated with the Palestinian Authority .
I confirm that we are in a genuine codecision procedure .
However , we must also note and acknowledge that an awareness of the importance of these reforms has caused considerable upheavals in the various political parties and in Turkish public opinion .
I will therefore be able to draw up this European blacklist , which , obviously , will enable citizens to be better informed regarding the quality of the air operator they are using .
Nonetheless , we must also be aware that middle @-@ aged aged farmers are facing the same challenges .
I can confirm that we will have a report , which will be submitted shortly , on the exact situation in Kosovo .
I am , however , firmly against all types of full liberalisation , as the services of general economic interest play a role in the economic , social and territorial cohesion of the European Union .
The item is closed .
They must be minim@@ i@@ zed as far as possible , given that it is not possible to eliminate them altogether .
This year , 2009 , will be an extremely difficult year for the euro area economies and for European citizens and there will be many challenges facing us , both internally and externally .
It is not a far @-@ fet@@ ched fet@@ ched idea since it has figu@@ red for many years in the Council &amp; apos ; s programme and I am delighted that France - my country - is currently considering it , but I think that such an arrangement will not make complete sense or be completely effective unless it takes place at European Union level .
Madam President , like the rapporteur , I think the Commission &amp; apos ; s report on European standardisation under the new approach is broadly satisfactory .
An@@ aly@@ sis of our successes could also be useful for inspiring our future strategies .
We have also talked about the ageing of our populations .
Before the Commission proposes a new draft budget , the European Parliament wanted to reaffirm the role that it intends to play in the negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework .
Firstly , we must redefine the powers and tasks of the European Central Bank , which must come under the democratic control of the European Parliament and the national parliaments .
The preliminary results of the current assessment , to which you refer , Mrs Stauner , will be known during the course of the coming weeks and will then be validated in cooperation with the Member States .
I think that each population is free to decide whether or not it wants to continue with this process .
In view of these three concerns , what I propose - and have proposed to the Commission - is a framework agreement .
- The European Parliament and , more particularly , the Committee on Women &amp; apos ; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , whose work I wish to acknowledge , have played a primordial role in raising awareness about violence against women and children on the European scale .
In particular , it includes in the guidelines the elimination of gender disparities and the promotion of reconciliation between professional and private life .
If we want to create growth and employment , if we want to continue to implement an innovative social model , the only solution is to do more at European level .
There is a blatant contradiction here .
Obviously this cannot happen without the national parliaments being involved in this debate , and I propose that we also bring forward the strengthened role conferred upon them by the new treaty .
Mr President , I welcome the publication of the Commission Green Paper on European space policy in conjunction with the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .
I believe that these rules could also help increase the volume of exports from developing countries , since many European consumers are anxious to protect these countries &amp; apos ; craft businesses and small businesses in the face of the multinationals .
The way this European Council has gone and the results it has produced ought to convince the doub@@ ters on one point : because of the major changes it will require to the present institutions and directions , a project that our fellow citizens can identify with and feel part of will not , will never come about spontaneously from a conclave of Heads of State and Government .
We await the outcome with great interest .
The Commission was disappointed that no agreement could be reached last year on our proposal for a framework decision on procedural rights .
Secondly , each Member State should have a representative on the Management Board . Decisions must be unanimous rather than being taken by a majority .
It is a project that the governments of the Union countries have a duty to support , not just at the Vienna summit but also at the forthcoming European elections in June 1999 .
- Mr President , we did not vote for Mr Demetriou &amp; apos ; s report , even though it is a substantial improvement on the proposal for a framework decision tabled by the Council .
They hope to compensate for the risk of dispersion which they believe the prospects of enlargement pose by a tightening up of centra@@ lized procedures .
Hence , as you said , your mandate should demonstrate there is no sel@@ fish@@ ness on our part , and that we are willing to eliminate a number of export subsidies . These subsidies are also ru@@ ining small farmers within the European Union .
I am sure that it will bring a great deal to the whole freight transport policy , which remains an essential part of our great single European market .
Being a citizen of a small country , I am convinced that the euro will enable us to participate in a common monetary sovereignty which will be stronger than it would have been if we had each remained in our own corner .
To supplement national accounts and data , the Commission proposed a regulation to establish European environmental economic accounts .
In order to foster the participation of women in social life and the labour market , we need to define a series of specific actions aiming to provide services that correspond to childcare needs , but which also enable us to provide assistance for families with other depend@@ ents .
To govern , however , means to make plans .
The simple fact that they have already taken on board the new Rules of Procedure shows that we are moving in the right direction .
Bio@@ technology cannot be allowed to dominate over everything else .
While we do not underestimate the difficulties we do , therefore , emphasise the importance of rapidly finding a solution to the humanitarian aspect of the crisis , to bring an end to the daily deaths , without giving in to what is plainly an unacceptable form of political blackmail .
It is therefore on the platform of these sixty years of peace , thanks to the European Union , that we could build the Europe of tomorrow .
Their problem is how to achieve the European social model .
Next , I would like to remind you that the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal was drawn up on the basis of an in @-@ depth depth impact assessment .
It cannot agree to the Council &amp; apos ; s proposal to convene an Intergovernmental Conference ( IGC ) without having a Convention composed of representatives of the national parliaments , Heads of State or Government , Parliament and the Commission .
That is more than the automotive industry and the agri @-@ food food industry put together .
That is absolutely meaningless .
The presentation and advertising of these drinks attract young people and could result in real damage to public health .
It should be made very clear to the general public that the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s right of inquiry , and the way in which it has exercised that right , represent a step forward for democracy in Europe .
The Commission is responsible because it has not kept its promise , and thank you , Commissioner , for examining the proposals for the next mandate .
Unlike , perhaps , some of the more resistant Member States ( the United Kingdom , the Netherlands since the last change of government , and so on ) , I am against limiting the scope to criminal procedures in the strictest sense ; I am in favour of including a broader range of procedures .
What has happened to the right to work in a Europe with 18 million unemployed and 50 million living in poverty ?
A large proportion of that amount has been awarded to programmes for which subsidies need to be requested from the European Commission .
That is why I have endorsed the amendments by my political group , which are aimed at improving this resolution in order to strengthen the demands relating to development ; to request that public services not be called into question in the negotiations on services ; to request , in relation to industrial tariffs , that the need to take account of each country &amp; apos ; s development level and not to suddenly open these sectors up to competition be recognised ; and , lastly , that special and differential treatment for certain types of production in the agricultural sector be preserved .
This is about restoring the balance .
This directive must therefore be applicable and flexible , as has already been pointed out .
You have clearly identified the problems which remain to be dealt with , and I am conscious , as I have said to several Members , that we will have to thoroughly examine these issues .
The truth is that these governments have signed a Treaty that they were not in a position to endorse definitively , and due to this set@@ back , we have a serious problem as regards institutional transition .
The European Union declares itself ready to support the process of opening up the country , as the Cuban authorities progress along the path of democracy .
At a time when the requirement is for women to take greater part in the decision @-@ making making process , the corresponding budget lines are being restricted .
On an institutional level , Malta &amp; apos ; s return will mean that the process of institutional reform will have to be speeded up . This is a necessary condition , in Parliament &amp; apos ; s opinion at least , for successful enlargement .
The report is also full of contradictions .
I am saying this again here very clearly .
The EU and China are also two of the most important trading partners investing in Africa , ran@@ ked first and third in the world respectively .
Finally , I should like to call on the Member States not to impose any last @-@ minute minute requests that might jeopardise the compromise accepted by all of the institutions , and not to further delay the adoption of this text , which is necessary from the point of view of free movement .
That is exactly ...
There is another key element in favour of implementing the programme as a matter of urgency .
We voted against the resolution on the conclusions of the European Council in Seville , because it approves the confusing statements which seek to mis@@ lead the Irish people in the run @-@ up up to their second referendum on the Treaty of Nice .
Moreover , one cannot reduce sex education to mere contraception , nor regard abortion as a method of family planning .
We propose to cooperate unconditionally with you if you wish to make progress on a European tax system .
Mr President , once again we are called upon to discuss the situation in Rwanda .
Regional fisheries committees , which serve as centres of consultation , and which take into account the needs of the profession , should be encouraged .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think we are caught between a desire for clarity and the difficult nature of this subject .
What fears it should inspire in the military junta currently in power , if this resolution determines the EU &amp; apos ; s policy with regard to Burma .
The European Observatory of racism and xenophobia which will open its doors in Vienna on 10 April this year must also make a relevant contribution to continuing the fight against racism , xenophobia and anti@@ semitism in the candidate countries .
It is the duty of Europe and our Parliament to remind everyone of that this morning !
The transparency achieved for programmes funded by the European Investment Bank is excellent .
I will mention only two or three of them .
During the last European Council , we primarily discussed two questions : what should we do during this period following the referenda in the Netherlands and France and what should we do with regard to the financial perspectives ?
First of all , as regards the diagnosis of the current situation , I shall not labour the point that the traditional economic , social and environmental indicators are not very good .
October , that &amp; apos ; s next week , so a meeting next week then .
The European Union has been working hard on this since mid @-@ December December .
I believe that it is basically the right time to hold this debate , as it is the first time that the Commission will use the instrument bes@@ towed upon it by the Treaties to send a recommendation , a sort of political sanction , to a Member State by referring to the requirements set out in the Stability and Growth Pact .
The factors that I have just mentioned are all elements with regard to which the European Parliament is committed to remaining vigilant .
The European Council will also be invited to adopt the European Pact on Asylum and Immigration , the text of which was the subject of political agreement on 25 September at the Justice and Home Affairs Council .
It was important for the European Parliament to provide a strong reminder of how much we must promote diversity , heritage and cultural exchanges in all the EU &amp; apos ; s external actions .
I abstained during the vote on this text . It contains many very positive points , but unfortunately it also contains certain ideas to which I am opposed .
The assent was positive : it agreed to Israel &amp; apos ; s participation in the Community programme , given that it was already participating in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research , that its application related solely to the &amp; apos ; innovation and technology &amp; apos ; programme , that all member countries of the neighbourhood policy are entitled to apply to participate , and thus that it constituted neither a special favour to Israel nor a reassessment of its political status .
I also support Europol having a Community footing , requested in Amendment 5 .
Social solidarity , democracy , rule of law : I wish that Parliament was more in tune with these values !
Therefore , we must also call for weapons inspectors and for non @-@ governmental governmental organisations to be allowed in to inspect the democratic situation and the relationship between the Iraqi people and Saddam Hussein .
Indeed , only an intelligent Constitution will merit the approval and respect of the citizens of Europe .
In addition , I fully agree with the proposal to create a US @-@ Europe Europe interparliamentary group .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s report on integration capacity is the recognition that there are legitimate questions about the implications of enlargement .
Madam President , perhaps we will have to invite Mr Romano Prodi to attend our explanations of vote , but I imagine that this situation will not arise again during the next Parliament .
Lastly , we have held hearings with the chief negotiators and the competent Commissioners on this matter , which has enabled us to deepen our knowledge of the economic @-@ partnership partnership agreements .
To my mind , the greatest challenge of this decade is that of social cohesion .
The debate about the moral boundaries of biotechnology and how to control them has begun .
It has also been scientifically proven that the underlying causes of global warming are pre@@ domin@@ antly man @-@ made made .
I have noted with satisfaction that the approach of the Single Euro Payments Area and the Tar@@ get 2 project is very positive and we will continue in the Euro@@ system to play our role in this regard .
That is my most important reservation .
- This report is a further step towards the adoption of a single asylum procedure .
That is why there are such expectations , and not only in Palestine , that the European Union will balance perspectives and give its own guarantee .
The contribution of other European Union policies is the weakest element of the current progress report . In particular , this concerns the system of governance to be implemented so as to ensure that cohesion policy produces the best possible results in the regions concerned .
In relation to the support envisaged by the 2006 operational programmes concerned , as soon as a request for modification is made by the Greek authorities the Commission will examine it with maximum flexibility within the context of the existing regulatory provisions .
Coming to the concerns expressed by many of you , especially Mr Crowley , regarding agriculture and the multilateral negotiations , I can assure you that Europe will not allow itself to be forced into a defensive position in this context .
Is this not the time to say clearly that enlargement will not be possible without a wide @-@ ranging ranging institutional reform of the Union , that we could not accept any postponement of the real issues at stake for the Intergovernmental Conference to a later reform , and that monetary union needs to be complemented by major progress along the path to political Union ?
It will thus demonstrate that it is able to react quickly to respond to the expectations of the citizens .
Is it not time that it opened its eyes ?
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done , and our fellow Members for their hard work in creating this new micro@@ finance instrument .
Your rapporteur put forward proposals , not all of which were supported by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , but it is clear that we must develop them if we want to avoid 25 States rejecting the possibility of developing this legislation outright .
The Commission stresses that Article 87 , paragraph 2@@ b of the Treaty does not constitute an exemption from GATT regulations as such , and we and our legal departments are assessing the compatibility of this measure with the Treaty on the basis of recent information .
We must therefore join Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of non @-@ dilution dilution in order to make animal nutrition safe and to effectively protect European consumers .
To conclude , I would like to say something very important to you .
We end up with a patchwork that is meaningless , when we should be focusing on the health and safety at work of pregnant women , in the same way , of course , that we will have to focus on gender equality in pay .
Therefore , I do not think it is excessive for the European Union to become involved , including for conservation reasons .
There should also be criticism of certain mal@@ functions in the Agency &amp; apos ; s control system , which has not clearly separated the functions of authorising officer and accounting .
Furthermore , it is imperative that EU programmes consolidate at all times the advantages of research and innovation , for the benefit of education and job creation .
The economic governance carried out by the Union within the euro area will thus constitute the basis on which the future stability mechanism will necessarily have to rest .
At@@ tac@@ ks with enriched uranium war@@ heads have polluted the town of Pristina and the other areas that were hit .
Madam President , first of all , I feel it is essential to point out that in this case , as in others , the precautionary principle must prevail , because human lives are at stake .
By taking responsibility for following through the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty , by directing the efforts being made by the 27 Member States to meet the challenges Europe has to face in terms of energy and climate change , growth and employment , by continuing the integration process of the Western Balkans , by contributing through your initiatives to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue , which will provide the chance to reaffirm the values of openness , tolerance and dialogue that are at the heart of the European project , the Slovenian Presidency is showing that the countries that have joined the EU since 2004 are now familiar not only with the EU &amp; apos ; s institutional affairs , but also with its internal functioning and the way Europe asserts its interests at international level .
We are also counting on the new President of the European Council to embody the Union on the international stage , to initiate and chair meetings of the Heads of State or Government , and to act as a reference point .
By extension , ensuring the integrity of the electoral process is central to the credibility of the Union &amp; apos ; s external action .
It only said that it would carry out a study of this technology in order to verify whether or not a revision was necessary .
I do , therefore , find the report is too partial by far and is even prejudiced .
I especially welcome the adoption , by a sli@@ m majority , of paragraph 70 , which asks the Commission systematically to include legally binding social and environmental standards in trade agreements negotiated by the European Union .
You yourself reminded us of our Kyoto commitments in terms of global warming .
We can do it ; yes , we can .
I must confess that the slow progress in Council negotiations for its renewal leaves me rather puzzled .
We shall now continue the debate on the Sta@@ tement by the President of the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s delegation to the Conciliation Committee - No@@ vel foods .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Madam President , the conclusion of a free trade agreement between the European Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council has been the subject of negotiations since 1988 and it would seem that they will soon be concluded for once and for all .
I would , therefore , like to pay tribute , in particular , to the presidency of the Council of Ministers , in the person of Mr Frattini , and its dedicated efforts .
What has come to pass ?
This illustrates the EU &amp; apos ; s willingness to enhance its attractiveness on the world stage by facilitating conditional access to the European labour market .
This is the goal of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives - the D@@ ig@@ ital Agenda for Europe , a fully @-@ fledged fledged industrial policy , a European Plan for research and innovation , a resource @-@ efficient efficient Europe , new skills for new jobs , &amp; apos ; Youth on the move &amp; apos ; , fighting social exclusion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a Charter for Europe and for the citizens of the European Union is a fine thing .
Europe does not do this at the moment , this is the existential challenge that we must accept .
A huge task therefore awaits us .
We want to continue on the path of a pragmatic , intelligent and effective regulation .
I am used to listening to Parliament . At the risk of repeating myself and in@@ curring the w@@ ra@@ th of the House , I did mention October just a few minutes ago .
This is the approach Parliament favours and which I myself favour , and the Commission is already looking into the options which might be put before the trialogue in order to avoid the pitfalls inherent in this type of activity .
This report also th@@ row@@ s all its weight behind the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development , a programme I strongly support .
The threats of dis@@ integration lie within the European Union , where competition policy is in@@ appropriately applied and the specific rules much too weak .
Clearly , this opening up is not merely for the benefit of Europeans ; it also involves welcoming creative arti@@ sts and others from third countries .
We reject globalisation that offers no solidarity , particularly to the developed countries .
We know that we will solve our energy problems through human ingenu@@ ity and science , but in an ethical and moral way .
It is looking at the best way of presenting useful information to citizens and directing them towards the information that best matches their interests .
Moving on to employment , the second point of the triangle , we must live up to the expectations of our fellow citizens , for whom jobs remain the paramount concern .
You are all Members of the European Parliament and belong to particular political groups .
We consider that mechanisms for stronger cooperation are necessary , in the context of the Treaty , enabling those who wish it to advance along the path to political Union while guaranteeing that this cooperation is permanently open to all Member States .
In this respect , we can only hope , if such a thing is possible , that the next Intergovernmental Conference will tackle this need to push forward , side by side and on equal terms with competition policy , a social policy of employment and an industrial policy which will enable the Union to defend its economic and social interests in the global world in which we shall be living from now on .
What is more , how can we explain that a very flexible mandate incompatibility system will preserve over@@ laps between the offices of members of a national parliament and Members of the European Parliament for a long time to come ?
And the public authority , at whatever tier of government , is the sole guarantor of that general interest .
- As Chairman of the European Parliament &amp; quot ; s Delegation on the countries of the South Caucasus , I welcome the adoption by a large majority of the Eurlings report on opening accession negotiations with Turkey , and would reiterate how crucial it is for the peoples of Europe and for the stability of an entire continent to open the doors of the European Union to this country .
On that occasion it was agreed that the Commission would table a legislative proposal amending the specific programme &amp; apos ; Inte@@ grating and strengthening the European Research Area &amp; quot ; and setting out a framework for research using embryos and human embryonic stem cells .
My second major remark : we are experiencing the worst crisis since World War II at a global level .
Enlargement will go ahead when the situation of the institutions is still sh@@ rou@@ ded in uncertainty . This has been made even worse by the crisis in Iraq , which has sh@@ attered our aspirations for a common foreign and security policy .
It is necessary , of course , to use the budget and the national budgets without creating sustainability problems for the future . Instead , the margins for manoeuvre in fiscal and budgetary policy should be used , and this within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact revised in 2005 .
That , in any case , is the message which the Committee on Development and Cooperation has asked me to pass on to you .
The Commission will express its opinion on this study on 5 July , and adopt a communication on the reform of the Treaties .
This emerging sector is opening up greater access to the world of work for women .
We fully support this approach and the two proposals for Council regulations which would implement it . But we cannot support the amendments tabled by the European Parliament which aim to profoundly upset the balance of the system in favour of the Commission .
I have a question for the Commission : can it tell us what stage it has reached in its discussions and whether the consultation results available to it at the moment will reinforce or amend the proposals in the Green Paper ?
If we achieve such a solution , which we very much hope to do , the Commission will be provided with a clear mandate regarding the improvements the Member States have agreed to make to the Pact , and the procedures necessary for a formal revision of the Pact &amp; quot ; s provisions can then be set in motion .
Furthermore , when making reference to Europol , in my opinion we are speaking about several things .
That is why our rapporteur proposes that the European Union should make a greater commitment by co @-@ financing financing the regulatory funds .
This is not a question of victory or defeat : we have an agreement between the three institutions , and the European Union has shown that it is able to take the lead in the fight against climate change .
This actually raises two problems .
Moreover , I am totally opposed to the contradiction that Parliament has now introduced .
The last 10 years showed that Europe was able to conduct civil and military operations at the scene of more than 23 crises .
This is the dilemma into which the single currency has loc@@ ked us today .
We did not devise the strategy and competences : it was the Member States who did that .
That would cause divisions .
From this point of view , I think there is a singu@@ lar contradiction between piling on the tasks assigned to the European Union , while sub@@ trac@@ ting the resources necessary to fulfil these tasks .
The European Union and Croatia are preparing their negotiating positions in many other chapters .
A very rich dialogue has been conducted with the European Parliament and , in particular , with the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the texts that could or should be adopted as a priority , the institutional calendar permitting .
Under these conditions , I can see no reason to give preference to such a debate .
We will stand together in attacking the major threat represented by large @-@ scale scale terrorism .
It cannot be said that our proposal has not been thought out .
If we want real European democracy , we must take a serious look at the place we want to give to European political parties in the European space we are trying to build .
Mr President , the Commission wishes first of all to acknowledge the high quality of Mr K@@ ou@@ ki@@ adis &amp; apos ; s report , which constitutes a valuable working document on the sensitive relationship between criminal sanctions and Community law .
This proposal , which also supplements the proposal on terrorism although its scope is wider , is based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments , which the Tampere European Council hoped would become the cornerstone of European judicial cooperation .
Joint action between the European Union and the Member States , in cooperation with the main international organisations in the sector , including UN@@ ICE@@ F , and with teachers and parents associations in the partner countries is planned .
I think that , as I have already said , the Council has strongly supported the European action programme to combat AIDS and other diseases .
What we urgently need today , on the eve of enlargement , is not to deepen the integration of the existing Member States at a faster rate .
I should therefore like to take the opportunity of this debate to question the Commission on the validation of the funding for this campaign by the PROGRESS programme .
When we in the Eurogroup agree that Member States that have achieved their medium @-@ term term financial target can now also act on the current economic down@@ turn and rising oil and food prices , they can only do that because they have in the past worked out the budgetary margins that are necessary , so that they are not weakened and incapable of reacting in times of crisis .
To this end , I believe we must adopt pro @-@ active active policies to integrate disabled people into the whole of society on the same terms as any other citizens .
Let us hold a debate on the issue of absorption capacity , but let us do so by highlighting the added value that enlargement has already represented for Europe .
However , as you said , the situation within Ukraine is not easy .
I therefore call on my fellow Members to vote against .
In this respect , this report should strengthen the European Parliament &amp; quot ; s capacity to carry out its role in monitoring fundamental rights within the EU .
I believe that the interinstitutional conference , which paid dividends at the time of the Maastricht Treaty , can be revitali@@ zed and improved , but that it is crucial in terms of the role of the European Parliament vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is the responsibility of Europe , under your leadership , to lead the world in this action , which everyone here recognises as being urgent and a priority .
It is your turn ; you still have a week , next week , in which to vote .
For example , could a State which today refuses to ratify the European Charter of L@@ ingu@@ istic Rights join Europe ?
The real response to the employment problem is therefore , of course , to relaunch growth and general policies of social solidarity and job creation .
We must all be reasonable , sometimes even this House too .
We would like to complete the negotiations on two major aspects .
Therefore , I would like to ask you to put Mrs Müller &amp; apos ; s original amendment to the vote , as it stands .
