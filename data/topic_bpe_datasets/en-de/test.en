That is why I proposed here a way forward inspired by many of your suggestions and I am ready to work in loy@@ alty with all the Members of this Parliament to achieve it so that we have a stronger Europe , keeping our internal market , but respecting fully the social rights of our workers .
I believe that is quite right .
That is one of the reasons we should all support the internal market .
It will have to be justified - most likely on a case @-@ by by @-@ case case basis - but we are opening up this possibility .
However , on balance I believe it to be a good starting point for a comprehensive debate on the issue and shows that the Committee can work together .
Good budgetary implementation remains also essential and in particular the implementation of the structural and cohesion funds .
That is why I particularly welcome the presidency programme on justice and home affairs .
Let us not bring in more , let us not dilute , let us be focused , let us get the job done - and Mr President , save your ga@@ vel for another time !
Concern@@ s have been expressed about the levels of checks on driving and rest periods and also about the levels of fines and penalties imposed for contra@@ ventions .
We need clarity and transparency in this House , in the European Parliament , about Frontex &amp; apos ; s deeds .
That is a matter for each individual Member States .
Despite substantial agreement between the Member States on this issue under the Irish presidency , none of the solutions discussed has won unanimous support .
Is it not the case that you will pre@@ determine the national priorities of the Member States on where they wish to spend their structural fund money and state aid under Article 92 ( 3 ) ( c ) ?
I think it is very timely , and the recent crisis in the dairy sector , which cri@@ p@@ pled so many of our farmers across the European Union , certainly demonstrated the serious volatility which can affect our agriculture markets .
This report is badly craf@@ ted on the part of the Commission and this Parliament .
I believe we are able to do that .
Madam President , I will be brief and make just two points .
I would like to thank the rapporteur ; Mr de Roo , for his work .
Emissions from the sectors covered by the system will be cut by 21 % by 2020 compared with levels in 2005 .
You can see that there is an enormous range of issues .
We cannot give up on this objective for the Western Balkans .
It was agreed that high standards of animal welfare and h@@ us@@ band@@ ry are essential to eliminate any need for such prop@@ hy@@ la@@ ctic use of antibio@@ tics .
I know that Members in my own group asked questions such as : will this person get this Commission post ?
Yet South Africa presents itself as a beacon of hope in an otherwise turbulent continent .
P@@ ort state mechanisms adopted within R@@ F@@ M@@ Os have been implemented through EU law , which also provides for comprehensive rules on access to port services , land@@ ings and tran@@ shipments of fisheries products by third @-@ country country vessels in EU ports , and cooperation and assistance mechanisms between the EU and third countries .
They are the main objectives of the Environment Committee .
Con@@ s@@ istent with that is the fact that the European Union is actively committed to ensuring the widest possible signature , ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute .
For the time being we will work on the basis of the existing regulation .
I would urge the rapporteur to rethink and support these amendments .
There is , sadly , a general failure by the EU to address human rights concerns systematically and continuously with respect to third countries and to mainstream human rights policy with respect to the Union &amp; quot ; s trade , development , and other external policies with such countries .
Under the conditions provided for in the Rules of Procedure , I have received the following nominations for the office of President of the European Parliament :
We believe that they must be fully explored , they must use the strategic environmental assessment principles and that only if those are complied with should we agree to this road corridor proceeding .
I hope that you will take our ideas very seriously , because they are ideas that you can use and we can use with you and they will have a constructive result .
We must ensure that Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is on the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference and that we also push for qualified majority voting in Council .
We pride ourselves on having a lot of achievements within the EU , and we lau@@ d ourselves - quite rightly - on our achievements , but , when you look at the current situation in relation to travel protection , the European Union has the least integrated market for travel services of any modern trading bloc .
Madam President , on behalf of our group and in the interests of trying to seek compromise and agreement on this , we would be willing to withdraw the subsequent amendment if the rapporteur would accept a small oral amendment , as written in the list , simply to make this less specific in terms of calling for the legally binding &amp; apos ; directive &amp; apos ; and leaving it as bringing forward &amp; apos ; measures &amp; apos ; .
Our great challenge is not a new Treaty which attempts to bind us by force but the spirit in our approach to the future of Europe - a Europe where our children and their children will succeed as they compete with the emerging powers of the 21st century .
The behaviour of the United States , not just on this issue but also - and far more seriously in some ways - on the issue of Iraq , is becoming increasingly difficult to understand .
The Commission has already indicated the priority it attaches to biotechnology in its proposal for the next research framework programme .
However , failure to reach this agreement now looks like it lies more with the Member States than with our negotiating partner .
Therefore the IGC in Amsterdam is absolutely crucial so that we can return to the sort of agenda that people understand .
I have noted the statements made by the Chinese Prime Minister W@@ en Ji@@ ab@@ ao yesterday in Beijing and I would like to welcome the fact that China now understands the acute concerns of certain Member States , as W@@ en Ji@@ ab@@ ao acknowledged yesterday in Beijing , and that China prefers , as he said , a solution based on dialogue and cooperation .
We call again for the release of all political prisoners in Syria .
I myself like to debate everything with people with different views , different attitudes and different assessments .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank the honourable Members for their understanding , knowing that I am not familiar with this issue .
I hope that the Commission will listen to us on this point and will truly mainstream opportunities for women within this financial assistance .
This is very intimid@@ atory , as far as Members are concerned ; it is an intru@@ sion on our parliamentary premises .
It is only logical and normal that similar rules should also apply to candidate countries .
Can you confirm that the Commissioner will be with us today to make a statement ?
In fact it is the European Parliament , using the power of codecision in a positive way , which has insisted on the protection of consumers which otherwise would not have been achieved on the original Commission proposal .
We have been so busy re@@ constitu@@ ting ourselves we have not yet had the capacity to do our homework and our research , so if the hearings bring to light issues of substance and public concern about which we as yet know nothing , we in this House would have a duty to Europe to act and we will act - certainly , my group will .
That is why I should like to thank again all the rapporteurs , Mr Cap@@ oulas Santos , Mr Galeote Qu@@ ec@@ ed@@ o , Mrs Estrela and Mr Ber@@ end , for their excellent reports that will strengthen European identity .
We can have a common approach to Russia if we really want to .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.@@ m .
Initi@@ ally the EU will have to negotiate bilateral treaties , but I am convinced that in the longer run a Latin American free @-@ trade trade area drawing on the lessons of the Mercosur and Andean Pact countries &amp; apos ; experience will emerge over the next decade .
I want to know how , as elected Members , we are going to be involved in this process , particularly if it is going to be as closed as has been laid out for us .
The year 2007 will certainly be an important one in our relations with a region that is undergoing major change , which has great expectations of Europe and for which a close relationship with the Union is a major priority .
That is called real solidarity .
I warmly welcome that last reply from the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office .
Mr Rocard &amp; apos ; s questions , I hope , will take the debate further and I will at least be able to listen to the Commissioner in the time available to me .
This House may not have competences any more , but the national parliaments are completely excluded .
The European Union has shown itself the pione@@ er of action on climate change .
So this is what the fishing industry throughout the European Union wants .
There were some discussions , but if you look at the final conclusions , it is clearly reaffirmed that Ukraine is a European country , Ukraine is bound by the same European values and we want to be closer to Ukraine .
Why do we want that ?
We believe that the European Parliament should play a major role in promoting this dialogue .
This is not a tri@@ vi@@ al point .
We must improve the methods of monitoring and impose stronger penalties for breaches .
The European Union was very ambitious and took the lead , together with President Jean P@@ ing of the United Nations General Assembly .
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes .
Let me mention here that the European Union &amp; apos ; s humanitarian work is severely affected by the restriction of movement , not just within the Palestinian Territ@@ ories but on arrival at the border .
These are : Amendments Nos 33 , 36 , 37 , 41 , 62 , 65 , 66 , 71 , 72 , 83 , 85 , 86 , 88 , 89 , 91 , 92 , 94 , 97 , 99 , 100 , 10@@ 2 , 104 , 105 , 109 , 110 , 1@@ 11 , 112 and 113 .
Each of our institutions , national governments , the Council , the Commission and Parliament will need to see how we can provide dynamic solutions that will foster a climate in business that is more conducive to innovation .
That is not an acceptable solution for fishermen and for the people who are dependent upon them .
I hope we will meet again soon .
The enlargement countries will be greatly helped by simplification of the implementation rules .
In conclusion , this is a very important step forward for the single market .
The Commission will closely monitor this aspect with the implementation of the rural development programmes .
But while we are really concentrating on the multilateral aspects of trade , on the other hand , we should not neglect all our bilateral relations with important trading partners .
A simple answer of yes or no to that question will suffice .
With such fast @-@ changing changing science and a host of possible unknown effects , it is important to protect Europe &amp; apos ; s people and our environment .
Finally , I agree with the rapporteur that we must eliminate the possibility of air transport following sea transport and using flags of convenience for ships and cre@@ ws .
As well as reacting to the complaints that are received , the Ombudsman should also have a proactive role in promoting democratic values , empowering citizens and widening the choices available to them .
I hope that this will be respected .
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank everyone for this discussion .
In particular I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Eurlings , for the balanced report he has drawn up , as well as the Committee on Foreign Affairs for its valuable work .
The full effects of the British and Polish derogation from the Charter of Fundamental Rights are not yet known .
Mr President , I want to remove the second part of the amendment because apparently a lot of people would support the first part , but not the second part .
in writing . - I voted to give consent to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia but note that so far , only 11 Member States have ratified the Agreement .
Perhaps the best frame for such a democratic reflection would be early elections .
Without a doubt , the targeted exchange and use of data for counter @-@ terrorism terrorism purposes is , and will remain , necessary , but let me be clear : European citizens must be able to trust both security and data claims .
Perhaps the Commission could also insert that on a regular basis in its presentation of the budget .
It will be very difficult , if not impossible , to create a single currency without the support of the citizens of the participating countries .
We know that Parliament has doubts about this amendment .
We should encourage President Abbas to continue efforts to form a national unity government , with a platform reflecting the so @-@ called called &amp; apos ; Quartet principles &amp; apos ; of non @-@ violence violence , recognition of international agreements , recognition of Israel as a state and allowing for early engagement .
It would impose unnecessary bureaucracy on an already highly competitive and successful UK ports market .
This year will be crucial for the Fund &amp; apos ; s future , because the Commission intends to make a proposal on the rules governing the fund and the way it will function in the next programming period .
Madam President , honourable Members , I want to thank you for this very substantive and responsible debate .
Mr President , I should like to concentrate my remarks on the two excellent reports Mr Gi@@ an@@ si@@ ly has presented for this House &amp; apos ; s consideration .
We certainly agree to a tougher line on communication and information requirements , but the goal of more transparency - which we also support - should not be achieved by the wrong means .
I think it is wrong , and I use this opportunity to point this out again .
They are doing too well to want to do that and we have waited the best part of decade for them to do so since the last review .
Will the Council actually sit down and discuss this issue with Parliament , so that we can seek a common objective ?
One part relates to category 5 , where the Committee on Budgets has created a working group to look at administration expenditure in all the institutions .
This is particularly true in the field of social and economic rights but also in some other areas .
Thirdly , the involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies is crucial for the enlarged Community .
Let me be clear . This report does not go as far as I would like .
Market access is a very important element in encouraging integration of developing countries into the world economy .
There must be timely , effective and comprehensive information and consultation with workers &amp; apos ; representatives and this must , of course , be before initiatives are launched or publicly announced .
On Amendments Nos 58 and 59 on Members &amp; apos ; assistants , this House knows the Commission has been and always will be very aware and sympathetic to the concerns about this issue in Parliament .
Member States need to strengthen their economies too , thereby creating opportunities .
The fact is that when faced with a massive arrival of migrants no Member State will ultimately be in a better position if it tries to deal with them alone .
In Europe today , we have been able to overcome those differences ; we have found a forum and a way forward in which people from different countries , with different ideologies , different histor@@ ies and different interpretations of the same history can come together and find common ground and a common cause .
Mr President , I refer to the motion for a resolution .
I am personally committed to ensuring that these essential elements underpin our future association agreements with Mercosur and Chile .
President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Council . - Mr President , I think all of those who have spoken have spoken very much in strong terms in favour of the defence of democracy and constitutional order throughout Latin America .
But we cannot expect rapid progress : a cautious , gradual approach is needed .
Colle@@ ctively the US and the EU can maintain a strong position , but can also give great leadership for the future .
Emp@@ loy@@ ers also need to promote a healthy working climate , paying attention to work @-@ related related stress and the underlying causes of mental dis@@ order at the workplace , and tackling those causes .
This will help us in our fight against climate change .
The next item is the joint debate on
The debate is actually on two separate issues : firstly , the rules on admission of third @-@ country country nationals into the European Union and , secondly , the rules on admission of third @-@ country country nationals into Member States .
The question to which my committee failed to receive a satisfactory answer from the Commission , was why do we allow such a situation to develop in the first place ?
That is just a start .
The situation in that country after the forced removal of President Ra@@ val@@ om@@ an@@ ana on 17 March deserves and requires our full attention and , like the European Parliament , the Commission is following events very closely .
What is his assessment of the current state of momentum among the Member States and what would be his test of the success of the special summit ?
There have been most serious handi@@ cap@@ s for European Union telecommunications operators and a most serious and dis@@ advanta@@ geous distortion of competition .
Let us say it is important to be realistic and honest at this stage of the process .
You , Mr President , the chairman of the Committee on Social Affairs , Employment and the Working Environment and Mr New@@ man in the Committee on Petitions took the matter up .
I am therefore asking for an extension of that deadline for compromise texts and amendments until , perhaps , 10 a.m. on Wednesday .
On the question of political responsibility , it seems to us that for some questions the Conference of Presidents would be a better organ to decide matters than the Bureau , in the sense that in the Conference of Presidents people are representing their political party , whereas in the Bureau people are supposed to speak for the Parliament as a whole , rather than putting forward a political case .
The Commission services , and ultimately the College of Commissioners , have submitted to Parliament a proposal which , we believe , reflects too many of the priorities of the lobbyists with which they have dealt and too little concern for the wider public interest .
rapporteur . - Madam President , briefly stated , it was not possible to have a debate and presentation of the report and I would like to thank my colleagues in the other political groups who have supported my recommendation .
In a recent reply from the Commission on the extent of over@@ capacity in the EU fishing fleet , I was informed that the Commission estimates that we have , and I quote , &amp; apos ; significant over@@ capacity in some Community fisheries of , on average , at least 40 % &amp; apos ; .
In the remaining days of your presidency , we look to you to ensure that the words &amp; apos ; a people &amp; apos ; s Europe &amp; apos ; have some tangible and lasting resonance through this action .
It cannot be left to Member States , since there is a legal problem , I understand .
Unfortunately , the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been sacrificed to the Dutch Government &amp; apos ; s fear of a referendum .
We all have the future in our hands .
Europe must continue to emphasise its commitment to development and free trade within the context of ensuring an end to exploitation and meeting the need for sustainable development .
We have new legislation in place .
The Union cannot hide from the n@@ ak@@ ed fact that the EU itself , together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , will have to play a key role in terms of financial contributions and technical support to make safe all these nuclear reactors sooner rather than later .
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no sli@@ pp@@ age in the European element , and , particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be r@@ and@@ om checks on that .
Mr President , it is important to say that , whilst we approved it quite clearly last Thursday - and I added my support to that in the Conference of Presidents - it is not available in all the languages and it had not been seen by Members , even as late as yesterday .
We will not achieve our Europe 2020 targets if we do not do it .
Now , we are instead exporting the idea of peaceful reconciliation , of integration across old borders , of common rules and regulations as the common way to better governance .
Today , we are asking for that same opportunity .
We need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .
Finally , on behalf of the Commission , I expect the forthcoming vote to reflect the broad consensus in this Chamber , making the voice of the European Parliament strong and influential .
I would consider these to be consistent with a common tax base so long as they are fully transparent .
So how is the Commission going to ensure that the principle of reciprocity in the investment relationship is upheld in the new partnership agreement ?
Secondly , in regard to the point being put forward by several Members of the Council that there should be further institutional change prior to enlargement , what impetus or weight will the Luxembourg Presidency give to this ?
I may not agree with all of the analysis , but I found the debate extraordinarily interesting and very constructive .
I formally move that we postpone the vote until the Brussels part @-@ session session in two weeks &amp; apos ; time .
That is a clear complaint that we get . That needs to be addressed .
We need a clear strategy for the 21st century aimed at significantly increasing the share of renewable energy sources in our overall energy policy .
I am grateful to Spanish colleagues here for drawing this need for clarification to my attention and in particular to Mr Gil @-@ Robles Robles Gil @-@ Delgado Delgado and Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra Neyra .
Thanks also go to the staff in Parliament and the groups , and to my own assist@@ ant , Elizabeth , who played a big role in making sure we were here today .
But that is not how discussion about the fund started out .
These are the issues that we have to deal with immediately , not just for our own credibility but for the safety and security of Africa and the European Union .
These improvements , as you describe them , are incre@@ mental .
Let me tell you my personal view ; it is unacceptable .
The Council &amp; apos ; s common position , which has been submitted for consideration to Parliament , is fully consistent with the essential objectives pursued in the Commission &amp; apos ; s original and amended proposals .
We need to know in particular what happened to the young Tibetan mon@@ k N@@ ga@@ wan@@ g J@@ ang@@ ch@@ ub , who died in October during a &amp; apos ; patri@@ o@@ tic education &amp; quot ; session .
I am convinced that Parliament and the Commission share the same analysis : all of us would have preferred a more ambitious compromise , especially as far as the approximation of tax rates is concerned .
I am very grateful to honourable Members for the fast delivery of their opinion on what we are proposing .
I hope our officials , ministers and others who agreed to the targets and timetables did so realistically , because we should not commit ourselves to something we cannot deliver .
Therefore the EU needs to refocus its EU support strategies in order to develop the rural areas in a women @-@ friendly friendly way .
Is the Commission going to bring forward something in writing ?
Within its limited powers , the Commission is trying to boost , as much as it can , the effectiveness of the citizenship rights European citizens are entitled to - see , for example , the Commission Action Plan 2007 @-@ 2009 2009 .
Mr President , firstly I should like to congratulate Mrs Haug on her report , not just because she is from our group but because she embarked on a Mission Im@@ possible to try to get the agreement of the European Parliament on the future financing of the European Union .
So I conclude in asking , why not Britain ?
The wish expressed by Parliament in its opinion for the first reading to improve consumer protection has , to a large extent , been taken into account in the common position .
It should also be mentioned in this context that during this year , the European Parliament and the Council , as the co @-@ legislators legislators , are evaluating and considering amendments to the European Globalisation Fund , an instrument aimed at the elimination of negative globalisation impacts , where job losses certainly belong , as well as decreasing the risk that redundant employees will become long @-@ term term unemployed .
Mr President , the tone of the debate in this House is clear : most of us want to assist the Irish presidency to reach a quick settlement on the Constitution through our political contacts , and with our experience of these questions we can provide both practical and moral support .
I hope as well that , when the colegislator has agreed on a toler@@ able risk of error , the Court of Auditors will consider this new concept in the way it finds appropriate .
The report underlines the need for Albania to continue with its responsible attitude towards neighbouring countries , particularly towards Kosovo and FYROM .
Given that he has admitted to this Chamber today that he and his colleagues have not even discussed this issue , at the very least will he respond to the request from this Parliament that he should table such a discussion ?
Ac@@ qui@@ red rights and legitimate expectations of existing staff must be paramount and that must be honoured .
I would like the Commissioner for fundamental rights to have security concerns in her hands , and I would like the Commissioner for security to do the job whilst respecting fundamental rights and the spirit of liberties in the European Union .
Then when I discovered that there would be no discussions on that revision regarding Article 25 of the IIA , I was , to say the least , somewhat disappointed .
Whilst we are subsidising our agriculture , farmers and poorer people in countries all around the world are going under because they are unable to compete .
It is not civil servants who are to blame for the problems , but their political ma@@ sters .
To me , Lisbon is all about creating a Europe of highly @-@ paid paid , highly @-@ skilled skilled , high @-@ value value @-@ added added jobs .
Whilst I accept that the fact that it may dismay such illu@@ stri@@ ous bodies does not automatically make your proposals wrong , I trust that you would also admit that it does not automatically make them right either .
I know that the Commission President knows it and I am sure when we sit down together we can do more than we have done up to now .
However , the Council and the Commission have responded to the concerns which Parliament raised and brought forward a new proposal and a new team , which we now have the responsibility to endorse .
The European Union should be fully supportive of the development agenda that shall accompany any EPA agreement .
The Commission is aware that Parliament has done everything in its power to speed up the procedure , including changing the date for the plenary vote from December , as originally scheduled , to today .
The EM@@ A has worked together with the Member States , EU agencies and relevant stakeholders to develop the system .
Again I would like to thank Parliament for its strong support for developing a European energy policy .
National competition authorities are invited to check , in the light of competition rules , whether a regulation has clearly defined both a public interest objective and the least restrictive means of achieving that objective .
Let me first recall that we are negotiating this agreement in order to improve the protection of &amp; apos ; made in Europe &amp; apos ; innovation in all areas where intellectual property rights can be breached .
So I ask the Commission : will the common asylum system be put in place ?
We have a recent report , produced at the request of Parliament , which shows that , if you were able to reduce by 50 % the non @-@ tariff tariff barriers between Europe and the United States , this would have an effect which would be much larger than the Doha Round .
With regard to the second pillar , we continue to expect the currently high rates of inflation to remain a transi@@ tory phenomenon and , in the absence of further un@@ favourable price sho@@ cks , inflation rates should fall below 2 % in 2002 .
To avoid the will of Parliament being neg@@ ated , I request that you send a formal request to the Presidents of the Council and the Commission that they should abstain from taking any decisions before the Court has given its judgment , especially during this electoral period .
It is still a priority for the Commission and we will go on supporting it .
The fishing industry , the processors , the scientists and NGOs must all be actively involved and their expertise utilised to ensure that the new CFP ...
There is , of course , the Charter of Rights , which , throughout the Union , is a guarantee that Union institutions and Union law cannot violate basic standards of human rights - European institutions will have to respect them .
On the main issue of enlargement , it was very important that the summit came to the conclusion that this should be an inclusive process within a single framework , but that at the same time we should recognize that each country should be judged on its merits .
The ECOFIN also invited the Commission to present legislative proposals to rectify the shortcomings encountered in the current legislation .
It has thus become not just a British problem , but is seen increasingly as a European one , as our debate this morning shows .
The idea is that we in the present Parliament should not do anything definitive , but should at least give an opinion how we think negotiations should proceed in the next Parliament .
However , this debate has pu@@ zz@@ led me somewhat and therefore I would like to put a question to Mr S@@ asi and Commissioner Verheugen , namely : What is the difference between what is going to happen in Helsinki and what happened in Luxembourg ?
Such a choice requires fundamental reforms of state , economic and judicial structures .
That is surely a contradiction in terms !
Pre@@ c@@ isely because they have been well aware of this risk , the Commission , Parliament and the Heads of State and Government decided to get involved in the debate from the very beginning and to implement in good time information campaigns on the Constitution which , while respecting the national specificities of each Member State , would inform the citizens and encourage them to take part in the debate and the referendums .
The European Union certainly has a world responsibility in terms of negotiations on agriculture .
I voted against this report because , of course , I also completely reject the whole concept of European citizenship .
The proposal meets the request of Parliament and of the Council and confirms that the Structural Funds have a role to play , not only by contributing financially but also by promoting an integrated approach to tackling social and economic conditions of marginalised communities .
I hope it sec@@ ures a common position before the end of December and I hope that this Parliament votes on Thursday in a way that will bring it close to the Presidency &amp; quot ; s position .
Therefore we will go on discussing a European network of crime prevention and what concrete operational activities should be developed to fight this kind of crime .
There has been little input from the Council too , and all I see is gener@@ al@@ isations here .
However , we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties .
We believe that the EU and Member States are already incenti@@ v@@ ised to implement energy efficiency policies through renewable energy and emissions reduction targets , as well as energy saving targets under the Energy Services Directive .
We must insist the Turkish authorities respond to the PKK cease @-@ fire fire and make moves to political settlement , recognising Kurdish cultural and democratic rights .
As many colleagues are aware , I have a specific interest in working with the disability movement .
We need strong , active labour market policies to quickly re@@ integrate workers laid off and we need strong and viable social protection systems to support those who find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own .
Romania has ratified major human rights conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights and the revised European Social Charter .
I do not share that view .
We must respect the rules , whether or not we like them , until we come to change them .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , on behalf of my group I welcome the tone of the Council &amp; apos ; s contribution and the content of the Commission &amp; apos ; s contribution .
The Commission can go along with this , particularly because the technical implementing measures for the MiFID are essential for the effective application of this directive .
But first of all , I should like to thank Mr Ferber for his report , which is very timely , constructive , balanced and well informed .
That is not the case .
We have not had too much experience of journeys to us as opp@@ posed to our students going to Eastern European countries and that is an area where our education could be considerably improved .
Transparency is essential so that policy @-@ makers makers and investors can make informed jud@@ gements ; so is the willingness to follow through with tough indispensable decisions .
It is possible that in the context of international agreement , the time has come for some financial transaction tax .
Yet now it is proposed that we be &amp; quot ; given &amp; quot ; our rights by European judges .
So the minimum we can and should do is to increase the capacity of the fund .
What we urgently need to do in Europe is to cut consumption by motor vehicles and electrical equipment ; cut consumption of heating through better design of buildings ; cut the consumption of electronic equipment ; and increase production of safe , sustainable energy sources - biomass , as proposed by the Commission , and renewables , perhaps through research by moving to a hydrogen economy or looking into nuclear fusion .
If it further promotes fishing as a viable industry for the small and medium operator , especially family @-@ owned owned fishing boats , then I certainly can support it , because , as it is , fishing is dangerous and in many parts of the world explo@@ i@@ tive - not just of fish , but also of people .
It is very difficult to hold together different cultures .
This applies to our domestic , as well as external , policies .
At the EU Foreign Ministers &amp; apos ; meeting in Bre@@ men on Friday , the G@@ ym@@ n@@ ich meeting , I will stress that resources cannot come from the EU budget alone .
The report acknowledges that huge disparities between Member States of the eurozone contributed to the problems we are witnessing .
However , the Commission wants and requests the support of all the European forces .
It is up to the Member States to take up their responsibility but we would compliment the Commission for taking a position at this time .
This is now an outdated view which has been b@@ yp@@ assed by recent events .
It is possible to take a different view on that .
The European Union could make a more significant contribution to the resolution of this issue .
What we are now experiencing in some of the countries of eastern and central Europe demonstrates why we must build an@@ ew the international economic cooperation to help countries whenever they are in times of need .
I think we have achieved this goal . That was really thanks to the in @-@ depth depth discussions we had , very often here in the European Parliament .
A coherent and collaborative approach is needed , covering in particular the three aspects I highlighted earlier .
The communication contains a set of pragmatic proposals for boosting EU @-@ US US trade and investment and thus promoting competitiveness , growth , and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , whenever we speak about international trade or European integration , we have to think of customs , which is responsible , at the EU external borders , for the correct administration of all the measures designed to tackle the dual challenge which customs is facing today : to facilitate trade while also protecting European citizens and the environment .
That is why I was rather disappointed at the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal regarding this regulation , although I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the very good , dedicated and skil@@ ful work he has done in this context .
It should not be about us trying to gra@@ b headlines back home .
We have fishing grounds which are extremely important to Europe and very important to the fishing communities .
Yes , Europe &amp; apos ; s political class , as another colleague said , continues to fail to explain the project and claims all the credit for itself at national level instead of acknowledging the European Union &amp; apos ; s role .
Is it the case that the Council still attaches importance to the democratic inter@@ play between the three institutions and that closer cooperation will not inevitably mean greater decision making by one institution , by the Council , to the detriment of Parliament and Commission and , by implication , the people of Europe ?
We are united in our diversity but with a set of fundamental and social rights that brings us together .
I believe that science and research funds should primarily address the question of excellence .
As regards the level of negotiations with Serbia , until recently we had negotiated with Serbia and Montenegro at two levels , on the basis of the twin @-@ track track approach , with the State Union on the issues that fell within the competence of the State Union and with the two republics on the issues that fell within the competence of the two republics .
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission .
They are partnership agreements founded on the shared goal of development that make trade the servant of this objective and not the reverse .
Similarly , we voted in favour of the first part of paragraph 41 and against the second part .
I am a staunch defender of genuine human rights .
The continuation of the L@@ F@@ A scheme is vital if we are to compensate farmers for providing public goods , avoiding land aband@@ onment , assisting in promoting biodiversity and helping to support rural communities .
Secondly , we wish the Commission to become more active vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis those Member State governments that time and again seek to gain a competitive edge and advantages at the expense of other Member States .
Those of us who believe in a con@@ federal Europe believe just as much that it must be marked by respect for human rights , by clarity of democratic principle and by interaction of pluralistic constitutions , rather than a strictly hierarch@@ ical model .
Does the Commission apply efficiency and performance criteria to these agencies ?
In that connection I encourage colleagues to support the amendments that my colleague Mrs Villiers has proposed to reinforce that independence .
At the same time , as I said in my opening remarks , I would emphasise that the Commission is clearly against unnecessary hold @-@ ups ups .
As the President of the Council will have responsibilities in the field of CFSP , this could conflict with the role of Foreign Minister and could cause confusion as to who author@@ it@@ atively speaks for the EU in this field .
A point not always made is that this si@@ ze@@ able budget provision is not just confined to support for farmers but is also a factor in the provision of cheap food for European citizens .
The opening of accession talks would represent not the end of that process , but the beginning of a much longer one .
We need to look at this clearly .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs , as others have done .
In this case , we demonstrated what the EU can do when we fully mobilise the resources we have .
As a member of the European Parliament , I hope that the United States Government and the European Union can strike a proper agreement that will ensure a sustained reduction in the level of Green@@ house G@@ ases .
The Commission will also be required to do so .
I strongly oppose Amendments 14 and 15 , which are directed exclusively against Turkey on several questions , including the fulfilment of international obligations , and make no equivalent calls for action or engagement on the part of the Greek or Greek Cypriot authorities .
I am not in favour of the EU passing laws on behalf of Member States at all .
Our objective was to pass on to sheep ( and go@@ at ) farmers an increase in the annual pre@@ mium but to keep within the expenditure limits set out in Agenda 2000 and keep us on track for CAP reform .
I admit that our Rules of Procedure state that we must deliberate on the matter according to the conditions laid down by the Treaties , but I would remind you that , last April , Parliament voted in favour of a resolution , specifically bearing in mind the Intergovernmental Conference that was then taking place , which requested , with a very large majority , that the seat and working centres of the European Parliament should be decided on by Parliament itself .
Yet we should recall that the NPT talks not only about stopping the spread of nuclear weapons , but about the world &amp; apos ; s nuclear powers reducing and removing their own capabilities .
But so long as procedures for election to this House are a matter for national governments , we cannot guarantee a continuation of the principle of proportionality and that is why this report is so important .
This is the final part of the Erika package so we also ought to thank the Commissioner , who has been working relent@@ lessly to ensure that disasters like the Erika and so many others in EU waters in recent years do not occur again .
Then we have tried to sal@@ ve our consci@@ ences by massive aid programmes which have not served to am@@ eli@@ orate the conditions of those countries but , on the contrary , by breaking the distinction between representation and taxation , have served to ret@@ ard democratic development across much of the world .
Let me give the honourable Member an indication of what I mean . We have to apply to the budgetary authority - to Parliament and the Council - for the level of our commitments in external relations every year , but we should be involved in a much more open dialogue with the budgetary authority about the direction in which those spending commitments should go .
This is the core of the problem when it comes to the issue of enlargement of the European Union . Ap@@ pli@@ c@@ ant countries want the EU leaders to give a fixed date for the next enlargement of the Union .
We must point to a more positive future .
Mr President , I welcome the vote on the External Action Service but , now we have taken this vote , I think it is important that we move away from procedure and structures to actually getting on with the work of the Service .
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it , which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision .
Thirdly , it sends a message to the institutions of the European Union , that in carrying out their existing functions which will not change as a result of this Charter , they have a wider range of obligations to take into account .
We would specify that this must be understood as asking only for Member States to consider introducing the concept of a minimum income as the basis of social protection when they do not currently have such a system .
We have also said that the national food safety agencies and the consumer bodies in the Member States of the European Union should be fully consulted in the processes we are now embarked upon .
The Commission expects that the incident will be thoroughly and speedily investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice .
This is a theme continued from the past .
Mr President , I can be very brief , because most of what needed to be said has been said .
This will ensure that banks , fund managers and ins@@ ur@@ ers will be able to operate on an EU @-@ wide wide basis , which is good news both for the future development of the financial services industry and for the consumers of these services .
This mechanism will enable the Commission to keep a close eye on developments in these very important areas .
Will the Commission outline the steps it is taking to improve its advance planning and coordination with the object of raising its game and securing a more positive outcome at future environmental conferences ?
Mr President , Members of the European Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , I am deeply honoured to be here today . It is a privilege to address you in a plenary session of the European Parliament , and I am grateful to Mr Cox and all of you for giving me this opportunity .
I welcome the compromise agreement on the Europol convention which , together with the extradition convention , I hope will be implemented as quickly as possible by all Member States .
This conflict is a challenge for the EU &amp; apos ; s common European foreign and security policy .
The Legal Service is still preparing an opinion on that , but we cannot rule out the possibility that in the end , we will have to consider this a mixed agreement , which implies that all the national parliaments will also have to ratify it , and which could also have - in reply to Ni@@ cc@@ ol@@ ò Rin@@ al@@ di &amp; apos ; s question - consequences for the voting procedure in Council .
However , at the moment the number of successful prosecutions is still low and the implementation record still needs to be improved .
The Russian authorities must ensure the physical safety and freedom of movement and expression of human rights defenders , in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on human rights defenders .
It is indeed true that short sea shipping is environmentally friendly and cost @-@ effective effective , and it is indeed true that it supports the economic development of maritime regions ; but we in Scotland call upon the Commission , therefore , to get its act together in respect of the forthcoming liberalisation of sea transport in the west of Scotland .
The European Parliament has been acting as watch@@ dog of fundamental rights and the Lisbon Treaty has consolidated the fact .
Therefore , if one acknowledges the need for a transnational agency to bolster the efforts of individual agencies - and indeed I do - then any such agency should not only deal with Europe : it must have a global reach taking in global information .
We should not change that .
We should review , in our judgment , what needs to be done to ensure that the agreements are fully WTO compatible by the end of the transitional period .
This is an ongoing process .
Energy infrastructure will be the foundation of our future economic growth .
I shall comment on two further issues that have been raised .
Furthermore , better access to the European funds could be facilitated by temporarily reducing the national cofinancing requirements .
The European Union tackles reconciliation from many different ang@@ les , using several instruments , such as legislation , the open method of coordination between Member States , and financing tools .
It also has an administrative and institutional capacity to implement EU rules and regulations .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . - Mr President , we have all been on a very long journey together and we are still travelling , hoping that we will reach our destination soon .
I should like to say to those EU leaders who have taken an interest in our country : if you are so keen to be involved in a referendum campaign , organise one in your own country .
It shows the widespread support .
Everybody has to stick to the Copenhagen criteria .
If necessary , the Commission will initiate proceedings .
I therefore take very seriously any suggestion that the Commission may have treated two Member States differently merely because one is large and one is small .
Each violation must be taken seriously and each must be condemned with equal force wherever it takes place and whoever the victim may be , because , as we know and accept , human rights are universal .
On the role of national parliaments , can I say this : let national parliaments take the power this Treaty will give them and let the ordinary decent citizens of the countries force them to use that power effectively .
I continue to express my concerns that this EU directive should not undermine the competitiveness and innovation of our brigh@@ test and best companies in Europe , in particular by putting EU business and industry at a disadvantage in the global marketplace .
This is about the content , about showing that we can make a difference in Europe , but we also have to establish a good dialogue and debate with citizens in Europe over the next few years .
Let us not look to the short term , let us look to the long term , because the long term is the challenge - not five years but ten , fifteen years from now .
But we do not have a cost / benefit analysis and enough concrete information .
We should therefore oppose the Japanese and Norwegian proposals to restart the trade .
Again I say to Mr Miranda , I am not here to express views on behalf of the British Government , I am here to express views on behalf of the Council and if he wishes to put a question to the British Government , as I said already to two of his colleagues then I am sure that the responsible minister would be able to give him a reply to the matters that he raises .
The European Social Pact and European economic governance might be part of this &amp; apos ; more &amp; apos ; , but all these parts require more European financial resources and harmonisation of Member State tax policies .
I think that all the comments here are , to a certain extent , very much in line with the Commission &amp; apos ; s view on the proposal .
That is absolutely unacceptable .
However , we can go further .
However , whatever the consequences for existing EU members , the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must view current developments with growing alarm .
Now that the regional aid map is up for review , it is extremely important to recognise that the European economy is in a dramatically different picture .
Palestinian leaders must make clear day @-@ by by @-@ day day their unequivocal condemnation of and opposition to attacks on the innocent and violence in all its forms .
On the first point , the conduct of matters , I very much welcome his wish to give us further information so that we can better understand what is happening within the Commission .
Mr President , on a point of order , I hope I may be for@@ given for raising two relatively domestic matters .
I can fully concur that an ambitious review of the budget should be an urgent priority for the new Parliament and Commission .
So it must be right for this European Union , increasingly and rightly seen as one of the bas@@ tions of democracy in the world , to devote much greater effort to promoting free and fair elections in countries where the rights which we are too often inclined to take for granted are still fragile or under threat .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE DE Group . - Mr President , I should like to speak briefly in support of this motion from the PPE @-@ DE DE Group and the ALDE Group .
We work with the very seriously and I can assure you that we take these issues very seriously , but it is a very difficult area and a lot of problems have accum@@ ulated , and now we have to find final , long @-@ term term solutions .
I have a number of points to make .
I agree that this new strategy is a dynamic process which requires constant vigilance and constant commitment .
Conservatives in the European Parliament have consistently argued for these reforms .
First , Members will be aware of the Commission &amp; quot ; s proposals for a Community patent which would reduce the costs of patent protection throughout the European Union .
I wish to extend those congratulations to all the members of the Committee on Women &amp; apos ; s Rights and all Members who have contributed to the formulation of the programme and the plan of action to combat violence against women and children .
All in all , the key to success in this year &amp; apos ; s budgetary procedure is the financing of the EUR 4@@ 30 million needed for the reconstruction of Kosovo and of Turkey following the earth@@ quake .
It is again a paradox : with the euro and with e @-@ commerce commerce , the internal market really ought to be taking off .
The implementation of the revised Accession Partnership is also important in preparing for further integration within the European Union .
As a directly elected representative of the people , I believe that we could go a long way to giving a more human face to the institutions of the European Union if we successfully promoted the work of these bodies to our constituents .
I hope that the main issue which has been holding the country back from starting negotiations will be resolved soon .
This must remain the prerogative of the Member States who will retain control of their own justice systems .
There is no debate concerning that issue .
I think that the progress that we have achieved so far on economic governance is an indication that we can , with sufficient political will on all sides , make Europe a stronger force in the world for the benefit of our citizens , but for this let us be clear that we need political will and we need a sense of common purpose , not only from the European institutions , but from all our Member States .
There are weaknesses in those method@@ ologies .
Those rules are far too complicated anyway .
It is known that countries like Australia , Brazil and others want full liberalisation in this sector .
N@@ ever before were women so well educated , but , when it comes to entrepreneurship , women are still largely under @-@ represented represented .
That is essential for our common goal to build an integrated EU capital market by 2005 .
What I want to see in the Fifth Framework Programme , which did not happen in the Fourth in all areas , is attention to the implications for society of the research which these bra@@ ins are working on .
It will enable and encourage towns and cities throughout Europe and beyond to come together and learn from each other &amp; apos ; s experiences , help them to tackle environmental problems and challenges and to work towards sustainability .
The Commission is ready to work on legislative initiatives aiming at giving consumers the information they need .
We are not dealing with a regulation or a directive here .
What dis@@ ap@@ points me is that quite often we say this is intended , but in practice it does not occur .
But one thing should be obvious : we have to reform our energy production and to rely instead on renewable energy and we have to do it now .
As an MEP I uphold the citizens &amp; apos ; interests before my own .
I thank you for lending your support to that approach .
Nevertheless , the European Commission is determined to undertake all the actions necessary to inform citizens about the content of the Constitution , but also about its importance for the future of the Union .
I can also tell you that this probably would not be possible without strong encouragement from the Spanish Presidency .
But it is also clear that there is no question of the European Union standing i@@ dly by at this very difficult moment .
So I sincerely hope that the vote will go successfully in the Parliament tomorrow .
Mr President , today &amp; apos ; s message should be that the CFSP should more than ever be based on common European values .
The Commission and Member States have also used the regular political dialogue with Gu@@ at@@ em@@ ala to reiterate the importance of respecting human rights .
Ap@@ pro@@ xim@@ ation and mutual recognition of national criminal provisions , which is not the same as harmonisation , will be of the utmost uti@@ lity , as will cooperation through police forces and Europol , insisting all the time , as the Parliament does , on adequate parliamentary and judicial scrutiny .
It is the duty of the Commission to ensure that this happens .
This is far from encouraging and I am curious as to what precedence this sets in the actual signing of the agreements .
Most of the amendments adopted at first reading have been accepted by both the Council and the Commission .
In particular the provisions concerning enlargement , especially the inclusion of observers and other provisions .
So there is a need for independent veri@@ fiable evidence that the standards are equal and , if they are equal , then there is no excuse for not transposing this principle across the European Union and , hopefully , in due course worldwide , to attain what we desire - the free movement of labour for professionals .
I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur , the committee chairman , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for examining the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal .
We will stick to that .
Madam President , as a new Member of this House , I have listened to the many speakers who have foc@@ uss@@ ed on Mr Barroso &amp; apos ; s track record in office and have voiced many concerns .
There too we need a hierarchy ; we need an onus to prove the need to intervene .
The Commission is relying on the Parliament to ensure that our proposals are adopted as soon as possible .
Small and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises play a huge part in this .
in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues welcome the strategic approach on the supply of energy as contained in the Laperrouze report on the Second Strategic Energy Review .
Now , a European patent is what the European Patent Office grants .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - As the Honourable Member pointed out , Regulation ( EC ) No 13@@ 71 / 2007 on rail passenger rights , Regulation ( EC ) No 2@@ 61 / 2004 on air passenger rights - and let me also add Regulation ( EC ) No 1@@ 107 / 2006 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air - recognise certain minimum , common rights for citizens when they travel by rail or by air .
We would have liked the compromise text and scope to be clearer with regard to the obligations of the Member States and the economic operators within the eight @-@ year year transition period .
I do not want to give the impression that our positions are far apart on all these issues .
So I believe Parliament will do everything it can to achieve this measure .
Let us remember that some scientific break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s turn out to be ethical break@@ dow@@ ns .
Central to the new basic regulation and the implementing regulation is this exchange of electronic data , with a view to providing greater speed and also greater accuracy of communication .
Today it is very important to be reminded that the Treaty of Lisbon places respect for human rights at the core of the Union &amp; apos ; s external policy .
If anything should be corrected it is this .
I hope that we can look in the future to a relationship with Russia which allows normal business to be resumed .
They merely update the text of this amendment , so I do not think we need to have much discussion on them .
Third countries must give guarantees on compliance with EU law .
I would like a further response from Council today .
I note there the reference to the need for &amp; apos ; a legislative proposal which is likely to include or be supple@@ mented by a clarification of the exercise of fundamental rights in the context of the economic freedoms of the internal market &amp; apos ; .
It is regrettable , therefore , that EU Member States are res@@ isting a rapid ratification of this particular Convention .
Once we know the Council &amp; apos ; s intentions , then we can make some decision as to what to do ourselves .
I believe that increasing the role of parliaments is vital to the advancement of reforms in public finance management and that there should be institu@@ ting or reinforcing mechanisms within parliament for bringing government to account .
There was also a question on the US visa waiver programme and the fact that a number of EU Member States - Bulgaria , Cyprus , Poland and Romania - are still not admitted to this programme .
You know this very well .
A country is either a member of the European Union or it is not .
I would like to thank both the Commission for their very good document and also Mrs Schmidbauer for her very sensitive and thoughtful report .
This is simply a democratic government expressing the will of its people .
It sets high standards and limits to production which may be treated .
Are we aware of the lack of activity by Member States , for example , their lack of implementation of the Equal Tre@@ at@@ ment Directive and of Article 13 of the R@@ ace Equality Directive , where the Commission is taking enforcement action ?
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission welcomes the adoption of the Weber report endorsed in the compromise text on simplified reporting and documentation requirements in the case of mergers and divisions of public limited liability companies .
Secondly , regarding cooperation between research organisations and enterprises , in particular SMEs , the Commission agrees that this is of crucial importance .
I am sure that is something that will also change .
different models of regional administration in Member States which prevent the existence of comparative data and the exchange of best practices .
I am afraid this piece of legislation is going to be rejected tomorrow , as Mr Wuermeling said .
Certainly this is a matter that we should also consider for the next financial perspectives .
Let me also briefly mention other provisions , such as those in Article 5 of the proposal : Member States would commit to defining national quality and safety standards , to implementing them effectively and to making them public .
I do not usually b@@ other congratulating people but I think she has produced a very co@@ gent report and deserves our thanks .
The initial advice which I have received is that citizenship , as described in the Union Treaties , applies to all persons who are citizens of a Member State .
It is a very good basis for our human rights work so that the Union will have a clearer , lou@@ der and more effective voice in the world .
It is against that background that our efforts to create an internal market framework for the institutions offering occupational pensions must be considered .
In terms of social solidarity , human rights and social justice , and in terms of the internal market , it is very important to understand that we must have the same minimum social standards in all Member States and in the applicant countries in the future as well .
We should also express our concern at the fact that the Chinese are preventing another country from providing people with humanitarian aid .
This decision will help to correct the imbalance .
The European Parliament must speak out strongly on this issue .
That is also the starting point of the Lisbon Treaty which , I hope , will enter into force at the beginning of next year .
There is a debate in this Parliament about whether , in a pre @-@ legislative legislative report of this kind , environ@@ ment@@ alists should be pressing to send a strong signal to the Commission to be tough , or whether we should try to be realistic in framing measures which might actually be those that end up close to the final form at the end of the day .
In addition , it needs to be understood , during the preparations , that the pace and scale of market opening is critical for developing countries , as is special and differ@@ ential treatment and tariff protection .
Five years later we still need progress .
The Commission , the Council and Parliament have all expressed support for a balanced approach to biofuels in which domestic production and imports will both contribute to meeting the huge requirement , but production will be carried out on a sustainable basis .
I would first like to clearly state that you may rest assured that we will pursue our course of action .
We should take care to distinguish between the two types of migratory flows in these two cases .
But I think it is wise for us to ask whether these perspectives are really sufficient for the next five years .
We need a proper business plan and we need it to go through the proper parliamentary procedure , perhaps through the normal budget process later this year , so that Members can have their say and give their views on this project .
It constitutes organised crime , and I therefore insist that it should be dealt with at EU level .
We in this House must remind ourselves that we cannot be selective in the application of principle .
The Commission will also consider whether , in line with recent actions and in connection with the elections in Ukraine , Moldova and K@@ yr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , financial support can be provided to the OSCE / ODIHR fund in order to widen participation in election observation missions , to enable more observers from central , eastern , south @-@ eastern eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to participate .
This proposal is simple and is not controversial .
The President of the Euro Group , Mr Jean @-@ Claude Claude Juncker , has forecast growth to be between 1.@@ 6 % and 1.@@ 8 % this year , which is a drop of a full percentage point over last year .
As the Commissioner said , I have taken a lot from Directive 91 / 4@@ 14 / EEC , which covers plant protection products , and I wish to add to that .
Please let us learn from that .
Mr President , I recognise that there are many issues we could discuss and there are many points in the texts in front of us with which I could take issue , but I do not want to take up too much time , and I think that these issues would be better discussed when we propose amending the directive .
Neither employers &amp; apos ; organisations nor the trade unions and the public sector have enough women in high @-@ level level positions .
The Task Force has to deal with two aspects of the problem , revealed by the recent crisis : responsibility - how to prevent such budgetary in@@ discipline happening again - and solidarity - how to avoid impro@@ v@@ isation , if a financial crisis eventually happens again in a Member State .
Everyone agrees that the action taken this year , most obviously for Greece and Ireland , is also in the wider interests of the whole European Union and all its Member States .
Well , I believe that these matters go to the very heart of the fundamental principles of the freedom associated with European law , particularly the freedom of movement , and no exceptions can be made to these principles .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the draft Anti @-@ Homo@@ sexu@@ ality Homo@@ sexu@@ ality Bill which was introduced in the U@@ gan@@ dan Parliament raises serious human rights issues .
The outcome of tomorrow &amp; apos ; s vote will be discussed with the Ministers during the public debate next Friday .
Ex@@ isting EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed .
As the ratification process on the Constitution ga@@ thers pace , it must be said that those ambitions clearly have not been realised .
Farmers in Europe will be banned from using particular substances .
We are glad to see that the Commission has , in Parliament , a valuable partner working towards the same goal , which is an integrated and efficient European fund market delivering for both industry and investors alike .
We should investigate that more .
However , to do that it needs a commitment to sustainability in all aspects of its work , and that includes integration of social and environmental factors into its economic and trade policies .
Mr President , I welcome all these reports but will concentrate this morning on the Bösch report , highlighting the very important work carried out by the Ombudsman which goes some way to respecting the idea of transparency and open governance .
That is why I would like to turn to the presidency and stress that , when we have debated here today and voted tomorrow on the second part of the energy package , it is of the utmost importance that the presidency start the discussions between Parliament and Council .
This is critical to us and the Commission has still om@@ itted to answer the question .
The Council represents the interests of the 15 Member State governments within the institutional framework of the Union and currently , under existing EU Treaties , unanimous agreement of the 15 Member States is required for any tax changes sought within the Union .
But this is a start and for that we must congratulate the Commission for its courage and fore@@ sight .
I expect the Commission to take on board these concerns in its review of feed legislation program@@ med for next year .
I would be quite happy to participate in that vote .
The people who have the greatest need of our protection now are the small producers and we should help them .
They are contractual agreements of very considerable importance and we cannot allow them to be determined by political lobbying .
In recognition of the harmful nature of counterfeiting and piracy , time should not be lost .
in writing . - I welcome An@@ ja Weis@@ ger@@ ber &amp; apos ; s report on type @-@ approval approval of hydrogen @-@ powered powered motor vehicles .
We have to act , and act fast .
Have we got a Stability and Growth Pact or not ?
I am very happy to inform honourable Members that the Commission can agree to the amendments that have been put forward .
I would be the last person to defend or to abdi@@ cate complete harmonization of indirect taxes , but where the differenti@@ als are so great that it is leading to distortions in the market and fraudulent trading then it is high time this Parliament acted .
Are we going to see an action plan on future defence industries and on defence procurement , and are we going to see the Commission using the instruments it has available ?
By introducing a sec@@ ession clause in a new constitutional treaty , we would also assu@@ age any fears that to join the European Union is to throw away the keys to freedom .
I admit this , but there is an ongoing vi@@ vi@@ d and deep debate among Commission services , as well as between the governmental experts from the Member States and the Commission .
It will not be the right deal if it wa@@ sh@@ es away our agri @-@ food food industry under an incoming tide of cheap imports from countries we treat more favourably than their robust economic capacity requires .
The report will help us to focus this work .
It is the result of a different kind of industrial relations which have led , for instance , to an agreement on transnational information and consultation of workers that is widely recognised as being very advanced and effective .
.@@ I commend the rapporteur for her tremendous work on this vital subject .
So it is very important that we tighten up our act .
The two are complementary .
The proposal to set up a national purchase scheme should , in my view , be re @-@ examined examined .
So I think we have a common purpose in this which will be achieved in a way acceptable to the honourable Member .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am very pleased that my first attendance at the plenary session of the European Parliament takes place on this important day - 8 March , International Women &amp; apos ; s Day .
That needs to be reviewed .
All in all , this will make us more competitive and will help in the fight against serious ill@@ ness and environmental problems .
We decided to abstain on Amendment 2 as we believe that military doctrine is a matter for national governments to decide and not in the prerogative of the European Parliament .
There were none so it then formed part of the amendment which was voted on in the first roll @-@ call call vote and was rejected .
I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing , before the middle of the year , a comprehensive , intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy .
But what are the new priority areas we should be thinking of ?
In principle , I support an extension of QMV and codecision with the European Parliament , but the very diversity which Mr Barroso quite rightly referred to will always mean that national interests will be promoted .
It is essential to stress with maximum emphasis that a clear distinction must be made between the costs of meeting the Commission &amp; apos ; s carefully measured request for 7@@ 17 new posts including 1@@ 18 posts in Deleg@@ ations , submitted in the amending letter last September , and the far smaller gross costs of investing in reform .
I suspect the Commissioner agrees , otherwise he would not have given tac@@ it approval tonight to Mr Cun@@ n@@ ing@@ ham &amp; apos ; s actions .
A vital role for the UN means its involvement in setting up , as soon as possible , a legitimate and representative government of Iraqis , in lifting sanctions and in providing urgent humanitarian aid .
This is , of course , a violation of the equal treatment of EU citizens , enshrined in the Treaty .
I have to agree with the honourable Member I am well aware of her particular point of view and her very supportive attitude towards both the employment strategy and the preventive approach .
We face a situation in the world today where all of our countries need a ready supply of energy .
Once again , we see the scenes on our TV scre@@ ens of star@@ ving children in Ethiopia and we remember the horrors of the last fam@@ ine in the Horn of Africa .
Stability and development can only be achieved with democracy and the rule of law .
The fact is that Commission reform is going ahead .
Commissioner , I am delighted to hear you are going to do that .
This will be a useful part of the reform process and I thank you very much for your support .
( Applause from members of other groups )
Mr President , Commissioners , small is beautiful , especially for Europe &amp; apos ; s businesses , especially if the big b@@ onus for us is jobs for Europe &amp; apos ; s j@@ ob@@ less .
There are certain concerns about some of the amendments .
The ability of Member States in the European Union to decide their own policy on requiring visas for travel to those states and to change it , as and when required , for security or other reasons would be adversely affected by this measure .
These things are in the amendments and , judging by the debate in the committee , I am very hopeful that Parliament will vote for them .
It must take into account the post @-@ crisis crisis territorial reality at regional level , looking for the most effective solutions to the challenges and opportunities of different European territories .
The EU has the possibility to seize the opportunity to greatly improve the energy market , solve environmental problems and create new jobs .
I would like to thank colleagues for a very focused and informed debate .
I believe that this House was very supportive of it .
Mr President , my task is the ordinarily rather b@@ oring one of reporting that the Legal Affairs Committee considered this matter and found it not to be wanting .
I also take into account that not everybody agrees on the policy .
The budget has also been adjusted in particular to take into account the recent enlargement of the European Union .
It provides greater clarity for citizens over the competences of the European Union .
It is time to stop the EU thinking in terms of central planning and becoming an &amp; apos ; EU@@ S@@ S@@ R &amp; apos ; .
Our European institutions must be courageous and provide leadership on the rights and needs of our children and young people .
For these conventions to be effective the implementation of the procedures must be extremely rapid and almost automatic .
Yet again , in March 1992 , in my report on the reform of the Scientific Committee for Food this Parliament said : &amp; apos ; The process of achieving a satisfactory scientific base for matters relating to food safety will be judged by Europe &amp; apos ; s consumers according to whether it is sufficiently independent , transparent and effective . &amp; apos ;
We are also working in the Commission .
We will demand the information that is both our right and our due as the elected representatives , and we will respectfully remind the Commission that this is Parliament , not a door@@ mat .
Mr President , to be a credible partner and to act as a global player , the EU needs to speak with one voice .
However , I understand the concerns , and to respond to the question at the end of the debate , I want to tell you that in the Council it is on the table , but not as a concrete proposal .
I ask the powers @-@ that that @-@ be be or the great and the good to do something so that in future voting time starts on time , as opposed to the rig@@ mar@@ ole that seems to happen every part @-@ session session with the time sli@@ pping by .
Mr President , following up on Mr Helmer &amp; apos ; s point on the Irish Referendum , you may recall another event last week , in the UK .
Freedom of religious expression is a fundamental right in society that should be protected and this debate is but a small recognition of the problem .
Secondly , it puts the responsibility to host them on all Member States and not just on the country that they happen to arrive in .
We need to involve them in different ways , from civic education , giving them a basic knowledge of what goes on , to engaging with civil society .
Firstly , on democratic accountability : this Union will have a system whereby any legislation in the future will be subject to the prior scrutiny of national parliaments and then the double approval of the Council of Ministers , composed of ministers accountable to those very same national parliaments , and the European Parliament , directly elected by citizens to represent them at European level .
I thank our Commissioner and our High Representative and their staff for all their work .
There are chapters in this entitled &amp; apos ; A Europe based on Equ@@ ity and Toler@@ ance &amp; apos ; and &amp; apos ; A Europe contributing to International Peace , Security and Solidarity &amp; apos ; .
Member of the Commission . - Firstly , may I just say that recommendations for the long term and for the next elections are precisely the area on which we should all work together more .
I voted for the G@@ lat@@ t@@ felder Report on the Common organisation of the market in cere@@ als not because I entirely support its contents but because it is in line with CAP reform .
Financial institutions should be obliged to prepare annual reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal control systems , and boards should have these reports adopted .
At present there are about five million people under the age of 25 who do not have the passport to the labour market that a good qualification or indeed a good certi@@ ficate or scho@@ oling would grant them .
It has already been addressed .
I am very glad you gave that undertaking today and I look forward to taking this matter further .
The fact is that we do not know .
Again , it is in line with what is contained in the draft resolution which is before this Parliament and we hope that that will be a basis on which the dialogue continues and there is some optimism that there will be a way forward shortly .
We have to live in the real world .
Nevertheless , it has at last been possible to reach agreement in Council .
I would like to assure them that the Commission is giving careful consideration to the question of EIB regulatory supervision .
The Commission has noted that the Council has supported the continuation of the actions currently carried out under the existing Fis@@ cali@@ s programme .
Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union has spoken with one and the same voice throughout the negotiations and has ex@@ erted a real influence on the debates .
That is what I said and I think that is correct .
. - Mr President , honourable Members , let me first thank the rapporteur , Mr Lange , for the quality of his work on this technically complex issue .
. Madam President , as rapporteur on the European Neighbourhood Policy , I believe it is clearly in our mutual interests to strengthen ties with our southern Mediterranean partners in North Africa and the Middle East , as formally set up in the Barcelona process 10 years ago on 28 November .
I appreciate that if we want to have an open ballot we can do so , but then we should not pretend that we have been voting secre@@ tly .
However , we do want to ensure the directive le@@ ts us continue with the approach in the Disability Discrimination Act , although we recognise that some relatively minor changes may be required .
But we do not support the proposed changes in the legal base , nor the idea of extending the response to emergencies outside the EU , nor the increase in budget .
The Commission is of the opinion that the actual market situation in this sector makes it necessary to propose at least a minimal set of rules and that , accordingly , the chances of success this time are fairly good .
I want to make very clear that British Conservative MEPs will vote against that report because we fundamentally disagree with the Treaty , with the process by which it was agreed and with the fact that it is simply a carbon copy of the constitution rejected by two of the Union &amp; apos ; s founding Member States in national referendums .
We condemn any terrorist acts and we demand the release of the Israeli soldi@@ er .
I am grateful to the honourable Members for their questions to which I am re@@ plying on behalf of my colleague , Commissioner Wallström .
Protection orders issued in one European country against an off@@ ender will thus be enforced in all the other 26 EU Member States .
The final resolution was adopted with 524 / 54 / 13 votes ( the ALDE Group ab@@ stain@@ ing , as the change to the impact assessment was not adopted ) .
In this I am hoping also for your support .
I would ask the Commission to look at that in the future as well .
That is a step in the right direction .
Mr President , I should first like to thank the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office of the Ecofin Council for his report to us today .
In@@ sofar as the Council respects the treaty and their own rules of procedure , I think that it is their business and not directly ours .
That is also why it is important that we take the initiative and try this out .
Thanks to this frank and direct debate Parliament is now in a position to give its assent to the Commission proposal .
Mr President , I wish to begin by taking this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
I can agree to this change as I am convinced that this type of discussion should be made in the framework of the labelling of feed .
This quest was successful largely also thanks to the solidarity of Europe .
The topical question nowadays is how we protect our environment - the means and the method - and I honestly believe that we should try to get that message home to young people .
The report also calls for a study into how the present national systems work , with a comparison between common @-@ law law countries , such as Britain , and other European jurisdictions , and how existing arrangements could be improved .
It is our responsibility to use them .
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross @-@ border border development , combating the problems of long @-@ term term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes .
I welcome all amendments submitted by Members of this House .
This is the beginning of a very long debate before we reach the stage of legislation .
Climate change is one of the top priorities for Europe , as well as for the rest of the world .
And the most urgent task now is to address these problems : to investigate all electoral complaints and to create the proper conditions for the upcoming legislative elections .
in writing . - I share the view Mr Sacconi outlines in the motion for a resolution on the Commission Green Paper on &amp; apos ; Ada@@ p@@ ting to Climate Change in Europe &amp; apos ; .
We have also discussed the issue with the Serbian authorities , who have underlined that they are committed to increasing the participation of people from national minorities in the police and judiciary , but they claim that there is often a lack of interest from qualified candidates .
Last November the European Commission issued a communication on strengthening the southern maritime borders and I call on the Commission to press on with the initiatives listed in this communication .
But to do that comprehensively will require amendments to the Staff Regulations and I am looking forward to the cooperation of Parliament and the Council in gaining the changes in Community legislation which are necessary to facilitate that further development .
The committee did not back me and therefore I removed my name from this report , and I will be recommending to the House that they reject the resolution that is now before them .
In the Middle East , I condemn the way in which human rights are abused because of the use of terrorism , especially suicide bom@@ b@@ ings carried out by Palestinian extremists .
In particular , the respect for diversity that will be required in the European Union of the 21st century is encompass@@ ed by the portfolio that Commissioner Orban will have , and I call on all colleagues to be as generous as possible towards him , and to all the Commissioners , but in particular to be helpful towards him in suggesting new ways in which that diversity can be protected within the European Union .
It did become less bureaucratic , and I think researchers and others dealing with these projects are aware of that , but there is much more to do .
Not only do these programmes benefit the individual students who participate in them and the schools and col@@ leges of which they are students , but we must also remember that they make a real contribution to awareness and a meaningful understanding of the work of the European Union itself for large numbers of students and their families . It makes it real for them .
Another point to which I wish to draw your attention is the question of improved transparency .
But in terms of the external side , the working group does not cover what the external dimension of the Union should be . As the President said about the current context , it would seem to be relevant that we should be thinking about substantive issues such as what the transatlantic partnership is going to be like in five years &amp; apos ; time .
in writing . - I supported the compromise package and rejected those amendments seeking to extend the transitional period for the &amp; quot ; repair clause &amp; quot ; .
We had many problems getting the information out of the Commission , for the simple reason that the Commission did not have the information because the Member States had failed to fur@@ n@@ ish it .
With their experience and their European conviction , both will bring a valuable contribution to the collegi@@ al work of the Commission on moving Europe forward , including the institutional settlement necessary to ensure a more democratic , transparent and efficient Europe .
I mentioned the two criteria : it is not a member of the exchange rate mechanism , and some elements of its central bank legislation would have to be made compatible with euro area membership .
One of the messages is to work together .
Therefore I would have a solution to offer you , and that is not just to make solemn pledges here before the House , but to actually consult Parliament on a voluntary basis on the mandate for negotiations on PNR and SWIFT , because that would not only lend democratic legitimacy to such a mandate : it would also actually strengthen your negotiating position , because frankly , although I have a high appreciation for the officials who do the actual negotiations , I think matters of such importance should have a political mandate .
These are the areas where African demands are huge and where , at the same time , Europe has a lot to offer .
I wish the delegation well for the remainder of their stay in the European Union .
Just to move forward on some of the issues related to opening up the market .
I would like to echo Maria Berger &amp; apos ; s concerns about the European Convention .
I see that I have failed in my attempt to convince you that some progress has indeed been made .
The Commission must keep its active role in building a genuine single market for financial services .
Mr President , I would like to tell you that I am very honoured to be able now to serve the European Union as President of the Commission .
Mr President , there was a lot of comment in the press to the effect that the votes on the co@@ co@@ a directive were totally predictable and that they took the line of individual Members &amp; apos ; Member States .
That explains why the European Union &amp; apos ; s share of world GDP is d@@ win@@ dling ; why we have fallen from 36 % 20 years ago to 25 % today and we are scheduled to fall to 15 % in 10 years &amp; apos ; time .
We also acknowledge that the situation of the Roma varies greatly from one Member State to another .
But there are two questions we have to consider as yard@@ sticks .
Further , it seems that particular concerns in this area , in our view - and in the view of the majority of respondents to our consultation - cannot be resolved through a financial reporting standard on seg@@ ment information .
Fortunately , China has ce@@ ased to resist the deployment of United Nations peace@@ keep@@ ers in Darfur and is sending some of its own military engine@@ ers to join the force .
However , it is not willing to single out individual Member States and condemn them summar@@ ily before the due process of law has been completed .
That is the question to which I would appreciate an answer this morning .
You should raise the matter again when Mr Pöttering is in the chair .
Also , the Commission should be congratulated for getting a green light on its administration .
The rest of it is for us to give to other people who need it to achieve what we think is right .
These considerations prompted the original proposal of the report in favour of the formation of a European registration authority to be considered by the Commission , an authority to which agencies would report on their activities and with which they could establish a regulatory dialogue , a dialogue of equals based on the European Security Ratings Committee , on topics of mutual interest - excluding , of course , any intervention in the substance of the opinions issued by the agencies .
However , discussions in the Council have shown that even the proposed minimum levels are causing difficulties for a number of Member States .
Mr President , before we begin the vote on the budget and the budgetary amendments , there are some statements I would like to make , some corrections and oral amendments that I would like put to the vote .
Pro@@ visions pertaining to utilisation appear to already form part of existing third @-@ country country fisheries partnership agreements and the report &amp; apos ; s recommendations only serve to further complicate matters in this area .
First of all there is the agency for cooperation of European regulators .
The agreement seeks to reduce the security burden on passengers , airlines and airports across Europe .
Now I come to the two big issues for this Parliament .
Finally , I very much welcome , too , Mr Duisenberg &amp; apos ; s taking up of a point in the report about the need to reduce the costs of cross @-@ border border payments , particularly for smaller payments which affect individual members .
Given the recent history of my country I have focused in particular on the tragedy of totalitarian Communist rule .
I hope very much that you will join me in sending a powerful message to the countries in the region that the political parties , whether they are from the right or left , should use the inclusive character of the process to work together on the European agenda and not take their argument to the street .
The final point I want to make is in relation to the way in which we now have a cent@@ ralized monetary policy and what we do on economic policy .
So what we are going to do now is to increase and enhance our cooperation , the Commission &amp; apos ; s cooperation , with Member States .
This is sadly lacking at the moment .
Very critical , as already stressed by the Spanish Presidency , is the fact that the impact of this process depends , first and foremost , on the transparency and openness displayed by EU Member States , because we can only be effective by leading by our own example .
As far as offshore workers and mobile workers in the transport sector are concerned - there was an attempt in the common position to allow annu@@ alisation of working time for those workers without collective agreement .
As you know the Commission is also in the process of preparing a Green Paper on energy efficiency .
That is why I think the report we are going to vote on tomorrow is worth our support .
We therefore call on the Council to withdraw its proposal and , as stated in the report , call on the Commission or the Council to make a declaration in plenary on a proposal for a new Europol decision , which shall be submitted six months following the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
I am not suggesting that , but I believe that protection can best be accorded by an agreement between the two sides of the fishing and fresh fish processing industry .
Mr President , like others I welcome this directive and the report on it .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the ECR Group fully supports Icel@@ an@@ di@@ c accession to the European Union , although the decision is firmly a matter for Icel@@ anders alone in a referendum .
in writing . - The EG@@ AF is an important structural fund in the EU that enables us to aid workers that have been rendered unemployed as a result of the shif@@ ts in global trends .
That has been a great pleasure .
These steps are positive both for Turkey and the EU and we support Turkey &amp; apos ; s efforts towards reform .
There is no doubt that the Commission will need good ongoing cooperation with you to attain these results .
At the trialogue which was held yesterday evening between 9 p.m. and 10@@ .30 p.m. , an agreement was reached between the representatives of Parliament and the Council that Sup@@ ple@@ mentary and Amend@@ ing Budget No 4 should be adopted as quickly as possible , as already approved by the Council .
I think that it is quite good that the Commission and the EU in general clearly stand out as the single most important contributor towards making this initiative actually work .
It is my pleasure to be rapporteur on the communication &amp; apos ; Rein@@ vigor@@ ating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners &amp; apos ; .
I pay particular tribute to the Commissioner himself and to his team .
I would like to ask the Commission why there have been such delays and over@@ spending .
That is what the Commission should do .
In only a few days &amp; quot ; time we will all find out .
Finally , I turn to the issue of a referendum .
I hope that will be the result of this excellent proposal and this excellent report .
That message needs to go out very clearly too .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , on behalf of my group , I too thank Commissioner Barrot for his explanations .
Comp@@ are this with Holland , Germany , Sweden , Belgium and the other countries where cooperation , codecision and consultation are the order of the day .
The difficulty of this task should not be underestimated .
No final decisions of course have been taken and , as I said to you a moment ago , the constitutional structure of that authority has yet to be decided and how it would interact with the other institutions of the European Union and with the national food safety agencies of Member States .
The first reading of this report went through Parliament earlier this year - in April I believe - and that report had two aims similar to the aims of this report .
I call on the Commission to appoint a special task force to oversee the implementation and the enforcement of regulations in the countries concerned .
Contin@@ u@@ ed systematic cooperation has developed between the European institutions and market participants .
I have two quick points .
in writing . - I voted for this report and in doing so welcome the audit strategy of the Court of Auditors for the period 2009 @-@ 2012 2012 and support its priority goals ( maxim@@ ising the overall impact from its audits and increasing efficiency by making best use of resources ) .
A framework has had to be established in order for us to p@@ lot Europe &amp; apos ; s future .
I support adoption of the Buzek report , which will enable the common position compromise agreement between the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission to put in place and implement the Seventh Framework Programme , despite my disappointment that the budget allocated to research and technological development has been reduced .
They will have to develop links with other Member States as well ; in particular , through a network of enforcement authorities of Member States .
Our discussions so far have yiel@@ ded this result .
There is the Greek Cypriot community and there is the Turkish Cypriot community . We encourage , and we expect , that the leaders of the two communities will continue their efforts in order to resume negotiations for a comprehensive settlement under the auspices of the United Nations .
Israel &amp; apos ; s behaviour is an aff@@ ront to humanity , to civilisation .
I am sure that this is not a ma@@ gi@@ cal answer which will solve our problems , but I sincerely hope that it will be followed by some other financial institutions across Europe .
However , I would not be telling the truth if I were to say that we were unanimous in our support for the final report we voted on last night in committee .
The new powers granted this Parliament in the Lisbon Treaty gave you a greater role in that struggle and a greater imperative to govern responsibly .
The Commission , of course , will closely follow their proper implementation by the Member States .
I personally support future enlargement to the Western Balkans and eventually to Ukraine , Moldova and hopefully a democratic Belarus .
I turn now to the specific amendments and formal Commission position .
On a personal note , I feel that the Commission proposal does not represent a level playing field approach since , by extending the increase of a possible 20 % of project cost merely to certain modes , we are missing out on the chance for economic growth which is vital to the cohesion of an enlarged Union .
Thus the same situation which gave rise to today &amp; quot ; s debate continues to exist un@@ addressed by this report .
We must not shy away from addressing the difficult issues which surround Europe &amp; apos ; s single currency , because if we do so we will be letting down those people who elected us to this Chamber so recently .
We must ensure that the European citizens receive value for money .
First of all , on the issue of retro@@ spec@@ tivity .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Gallagher and other speakers for their generous tributes to my predecessor , the late Dr Al@@ lan Macartney .
Let me conclude by expressing my special thanks to the European Parliament for its continuous support , over the years , of the Commission &amp; apos ; s efforts to achieve better financial management of the European Union &amp; apos ; s budget .
On correlation tables , my group supports making this obligatory for Member States , but this is a horizontal issue that affects all European legislation and cannot be resolved in this one file .
The Georgian leadership must avoid any actions that could heigh@@ ten tension .
rapporteur . - Mr President , Madam Commissioner , colleagues , and interpreters who are staying this late on such an interesting day as today with the European Council discussing Georgia , I hope you will have a little time and energy to focus on another report which is , despite its technic@@ ality , quite important for all of us .
In conclusion , I stress that services of general interest are an area of ongoing concern which will require new initiatives in future and further development of Community legislation .
Its approval by both a majority in the elected Parliament and by a qualified majority of governments in the Council is proof of its acceptability to a wide range of opinions .
Finally , on the contracting of mine @-@ action action projects , I would caution against the introduction of stricter limitations to the participation in our tenders .
That is the clear analysis we can make today .
The European Union will continue with its support for the six @-@ party party talks and with its engagement policy in an attempt to obtain practical improvements and treat the cause of the problem .
I therefore welcome the steps that have been taken here , but there is a long way to go .
Fan@@ tasti@@ c .
As you know , the Commission carried out an extended impact assessment in preparing this proposal .
The position of the Union is that a range of initiatives are being taken to try to break the log@@ j@@ am in the peace process in the Middle East .
In light of the Commission &amp; quot ; s dedication further to improving and promoting its cooperation with the Ombudsman , I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the very recent reform of the Commission &amp; quot ; s internal procedures .
I fear , however , that what we are getting is not that .
Well done , President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office - and friend , if I can say that - because that leads me to my third and last message .
I should like to point out that this is not actually the case .
Mr President , for a moment I thought we were being left out .
Central to this proposal is the insistence that dialogue is reciprocal , that the opinions expressed need to be heeded and respected .
We believe , as a Parliament - and we have said this many times in the past - that this is essential for both environmental and safety reasons .
If this applies to our own nationals , it seems only reasonable for those entitled to international protection to benefit from an equivalent entit@@ lement if we are to avoid creating social exclusion , contrary to our own EU policy .
In spite of its own challenges , South Africa is already demonstrating its commitment to support its neighbours in the region . For example , in its agreement to a highly asymme@@ tri@@ cal liberalisation agreement with the other SADC countries which will benefit those countries .
It seems that something which has at last changed is the Council and Commission &amp; apos ; s willingness to take firm action .
The full agreements will be flexible and comprehensive .
Every time that we in Parliament or Member States in the Council say that we should have different adap@@ tive rules by the Member States we make this issue more complex .
Because until this law comes into force , recovery of debts from another EU State is a costly legal process .
In the years ahead we should invest more in the Belar@@ ussi@@ an people in this way .
Second , the European Council took stock of the progress made in implementing the economic and social agenda adopted at Lisbon .
Im@@ ports into the United States , into Canada , China and Japan are subject to country of origin marking .
I am committed to working closely with you , Mr President , as well as with Chancellor Merkel and her successors at the hel@@ m of the Council .
I therefore thank him and the House for supporting this useful and progressive proposal as an investment in stable democracy in yet another part of our continent .
It shows that whereas the initial draft proposal from the Commission came out in November / December 1999 , it literally took a full five months before the report came before Parliament .
It is very important that we maintain the closest links , as the previous speaker mentioned .
Let me also highlight the need for the new , newly @-@ elected elected High Representative and Vice @-@ President President to effectively consult Parliament ex ante on the main aspects of the basic choices of CFSP and ESDP .
We are also aware of the fact that there are a number of important differences of detail which have to be resolved through the vote .
Mr President , I am very pleased that we are discussing the excellent report by Mrs Ždanoka tonight , but I should like to remind you that tomorrow , unfortunately , we will be discussing a resolution on ra@@ mp@@ ant racism and hom@@ opho@@ bic violence in Europe .
I note with interest the proposals made in the resolution for the establishment of an &amp; apos ; EU &amp; apos ; seat .
Mr President , I thank you for your very kind remarks about Women &amp; apos ; s Day , and a very happy day to all the bro@@ thers and s@@ is@@ ters in the House and indeed in the gallery .
I hope there will be rapid agreement in the Commission and in the management committee on the programmes we have in mind so that deliver@@ ies can indeed start in the second half of November .
This is an important point which should not be forgotten .
Madam President , I would like stra@@ igh@@ ta@@ way to thank Mr Schmidt for this report and for drawing attention to my increasingly con@@ spi@@ cu@@ ous consumption habits , which , I am afraid , are becoming only too obvious as I grow into this job as Europe &amp; quot ; s Trade Commissioner .
The new provision on the freedom to provide services , which was at the heart of the compromise in first reading , strikes a fair balance between guaranteeing the rights of service providers to free access and free exercise of a service activity whilst allowing Member States the right to invoke their most essential requirements in certain clearly defined circumstances .
Farmers have been traum@@ atis@@ ed by the fall in their income so I hope that is the end of it .
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe .
I thank those shadow rapporteurs on the main report and on my opinion for their full cooperation .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - It has been drawn to the attention of the honourable Member that the detailed answers provided below relate only to the Commission , which is of course by far the major employer amongst European institutions .
I take that into account .
I support the idea of Minister Malmström that the Baltic Sea Strategy can be seen as a model pilot project for other macro@@ regions of Europe .
Madam President , I too found this a particularly difficult decision .
With this in mind the framework directive should set out the general principles governing the behaviour of traders at all stages of their commercial dealings , so that consumers &amp; apos ; rights are effectively enforced .
In the circumstances , the Commission recommends the adoption of this without amendment .
I would like to draw the attention of the House to the Global Health Fund that has been established .
It is regrettable that we are not sending our highest official to attend that conference on behalf of the Community .
Mr President , I shall speak first about Kosovo .
His mandate as special advis@@ er is as follows : advise the Vice @-@ President President responsible for administration , audit and fraud prevention as regards property policy ; improve relations with the competent authorities in Brussels and Luxembourg ; optimise effectiveness of the investments to be made by the Commission .
My Group believes that it is in the long @-@ term term interests of Europe &amp; apos ; s citizens .
Mr President , I can only congratulate Ms K@@ eller for what she has said and her analysis .
This would be in no one &amp; apos ; s interests .
This report was actually split into two .
E@@ mer@@ gency plans to be used in case of accidents must be established , not only by the operator but also by the competent authorities .
Mr President , advertising is a crucial part of a well @-@ functioning functioning internal market to foster competition and give choice to consumers .
Our high standards must not be lo@@ wer@@ ed under pressure from any third country , even from our closest partners .
There is moderate criticism of it , but I believe that an agreement between groups can be found on that .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to warmly thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent work they have carried out regarding the adoption of International Financial Re@@ porting Standard ( IFRS ) 8 - Oper@@ ating Seg@@ ments , the new standard on seg@@ ment information .
We know very well which countries manufacture , sell and use landmines , yet we do not do enough to stop them and punish them for their evil do@@ ings .
We are grateful for the multiple diplomatic efforts by the EU , its presidency , the United States and also Russia .
S@@ inc@@ er@@ ely and warmly I would like to thank him for this report , which I think is very valuable and will be well received .
However , the conclusion that we are divided in this House on this issue is not justified .
President , Members , I trust I can count on your full support as regards the next step in the legislative process towards finalising this worthy and much needed initiative .
We have to understand that the model of the future will not be like the model of the past .
Can the Commission ensure or recommend that that practice will be applied right throughout the European Union ?
I can assure you , from my own experience with her as a Member of the Commission , of her deep commitment to the European project .
Parliaments are there to set policy , to implement and oversee the implementation of policy and to account for money .
We recognise there is genuine public concern about these issues but would like to emphasise the need to keep these matters in perspective .
We accept that , we accept the vitality and the vigour of the market .
Finally , Mr President , I would say that there is already a confusion in the minds of parliamentarians about who is responsible inside the Commission for key elements of this problem .
This was a cause for great concern .
I am therefore especially pleased that by now , both Bulgaria and Romania have received positive evaluation of their technical preparedness to apply the entirety of the Schengen acquis .
If you look into the figures of what has happened when animals are cloned , cloned cal@@ ves are often 25 % hea@@ vier than normal , leading to a painful birth ; 25 % of co@@ ws pregnant with cl@@ ones at day 120 of gest@@ ation develop hydro@@ all@@ an@@ to@@ is .
International aviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally been governed by bilateral air services agreements .
So we do our best to try and get the transposition eff@@ ected as quickly as possible .
Some differences may be small , but some are very big indeed .
The European Union can and should give a greater contribution in this field .
We should remember that we have a key dialogue with this region .
Over the longer term , the international community must remain engaged , with a focus on supporting institutional recovery and promoting Le@@ ban@@ ese state @-@ building building efforts , including those undertaken via the national dialogue .
in writing . - I voted against the Ch@@ atz@@ imar@@ kakis report , because the Commission proposal is more environmentally friendly .
They must ensure that there is respect for minorities and that further steps are taken towards regionalisation .
We are in real danger of adding an extra la@@ yer of victim@@ ization for many of these women who are being brought into the trafficking net by being offered work opportunities in the EU as au pa@@ ir@@ s , domestic workers or as wa@@ it@@ re@@ sses .
Mr President , I think it is very important - and I agree with many of the previous speakers - that EU citizens need to feel secure , and I think it is a priority that we look after the security of our citizens when they are outside the European Union , especially in crisis situations such as we had in M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I really appreciate your contributions .
It is also clear that strategic input is expected to be matched by a very practical commitment , so I believe that you will remember this when we are discussing our practical contribution to the future Afghan mission .
I must stress , however , that the quality of such work will depend on the quality and compatibility of the data provided by the Member States .
This is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are putting forward now .
This committee will be able to take forward the good work of the current Joint Parliamentary Committee and will provide an important opportunity to guide Albania in the best traditions of European parliamentary democracy .
I would like especially and sincerely to thank the Committee on Culture for its efforts to accelerate the procedure , and the rapporteur , Mr T@@ ak@@ kul@@ a , for his excellent work and cooperation .
We remain convinced that that needs to be the case , and I very much hope therefore that the proposal to reject the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposal will be agreed in the vote tomorrow , just as it was in plenary last spring and in the Employment Committee this March .
I would also like to thank the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office for being here .
The rapporteur has endeav@@ oured to achieve that .
I am not convinced that the Commission is united on this matter and the consent of the Member States is needed .
We need to be very clear about that .
The 10 new Member States are already eager to join , as they voted for in the separate and unanimously positive referenda before accession .
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Or@@ land@@ o on his courage and his report . It is a timely one .
I welcome the initiative of the European Parliament and share the rapporteur &amp; quot ; s commitment to equal opportunities in the fisheries sector .
Pat@@ ents are an important plank of legal rights to encourage inventions .
Having said that , I promised you that I would follow this up and cooperate with you in that regard .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to once again thank the rapporteur and the plenary for their support for putting Taiwan on the positive list .
Many Members of this House have mentioned the matter of Article 202 .
Like my colleague , I , too , would be concerned about rural development policy - albeit not as part of the cohesion policy , more in line with the CAP - but , at the same time , it is absolutely vital that it is not squee@@ zed in any future proposals because rural development , and particularly the family farm , is vital for the social infrastructure of society .
The difficulties manifest themselves today in Europe in the pressure for people from less developed countries wanting to mig@@ rate to Europe , and in people fle@@ eing from some of the countries that are so desperate not just because of their economic situation , but also their lack of democracy and violence , and seeking asylum in the west .
It is through such cooperation that we can improve the quality of development assistance and its targeting .
However , we need to be more focused and targeted in our approach and I am not entirely convinced that the proposal in this report to broadc@@ ast Parliament &amp; apos ; s plenary part @-@ sessions sessions on the Internet , will really solve the problem .
We could do with that in this debate .
The differences in attitude , eth@@ os , resources and the degree of independence among the national regulators are still a cause for concern .
This is something we are discussing not only for their protection and the human rights aspect of it , which , of course , is a priority , but also for the protection of society as a whole .
If our democratic role in monitoring is to be effective , Article 202 of the Treaty must reflect codecision over implementing committees , otherwise there will be always be a bi@@ as in this House against the delegation of powers that are necessary to deal with some extremely technical matters .
Parliament has given a lot in trying to get an agreement at the Convention and the Council also claims that it has done the same .
We look for good and harmonious relations , but we cannot have them if this House and this European Union is divided .
You have been accessible to Members of this Parliament .
From the outset we should be in support of this round , we should have a positive outlook to ensure that we can avoid protectionism , promote free trade and extend prosperity in the world system to other parts of the world .
The European Community Mechanism for Civil Protection made a contribution to the overall relief effort and showed Europe &amp; apos ; s solidarity with the population of Taiwan .
Indeed , we should not allow GMOs to obsc@@ ure the fact that meat and bon@@ emeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe .
It is important for the Union that at the end of the process the priority for the Union and for its coherence is a factor which all Member States will take into account in submitting their views to the Council to enable it to reach a decision on those important matters .
E@@ ver since the publication of the TENs progress report at the Cardiff Council meeting of 1998 , there has been concern that some Member States have not succeeded in bringing forward projects which are appropriate for the type of funding contained .
Member of the Commission . - People have often said that societies should be judged by the way they treat their weak@@ est members .
On enforcement , we find that the provisions on conformity assessment and marking are going to make a difference , as they set clear obligations both on how economic operators show that their products are compliant and on how Member States are supposed to verify compliance .
In spite of Commissioner Dimas &amp; apos ; good words about the importance of tackling illegal log@@ ging , the Commission proposal as it stands simply is not up to the job .
Thirdly , Commissioner , this is not the end .
Mr President , I am very much in favour of EU research cooperation .
Mr President , I should like to express my gratitude to honourable Members for tabling this motion for a resolution .
In this respect , we warmly welcome the own @-@ initiative initiative report drawn up by Ms W@@ agen@@ kne@@ cht , which aims at setting up the necessary fiscal framework to encourage risk and innovative investments in order to achieve the objectives of growth and employment .
You certainly played your part , following on from the very fine work done by your predecessor Mr H@@ än@@ sch in ensuring that we could , at this particular time , be in a position to face the electorate in a way that we could with@@ stand the criticisms and cyni@@ c@@ isms that were going to be directed at us .
Likewise , we - the EU - have been re@@ bu@@ ff@@ ed for observer status .
I support both the Commission &amp; apos ; s proposals and the rapporteur &amp; apos ; s suggestions .
Mr President , although the Commission has presented all the proposals required by the Treaty 18 months ahead of the deadline set by the Treaty of Amsterdam , it is true that only a few of the objectives defined for the establishment of a common asylum and migration policy have effectively been met .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank all the honourable Members for their positive and kind words concerning the Commission &amp; apos ; s work programme .
Improving the control arrangements in the Member States is central to ensuring the correct use of Union funds .
Can you assure us : when is the next F@@ VO report , and will you actually take it seriously and ban whichever countries fail to meet our standards ?
We must look within ourselves for a new consensus and strive to reg@@ ain the confidence of our citizens , but we must also look out@@ wards towards our global responsibilities and opportunities .
For the moment , opinions largely conflict , and we will have to cut short as matters have reached political level , but we wanted to know at least the ideas of the consumer associations .
The core in democracy is the ability to hold elections , have a new majority and then new laws .
in writing . - I welcome this report , which backs a Commission proposal to mobilise EUR 2 8@@ 90 0@@ 27 from the European Globalisation Fund in order to support the re@@ integration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the economic crisis .
We can assure you that the commitments of the EU and of Russia to uphold human rights , including those of persons belonging to minorities , will figure very prominently in this agreement and indeed constitute an essential element of the future agreement .
As colleagues know , some states in Central America in particular are compla@@ ining that Brussels is making its trade and aid agreements conditional on their participation in regional structures .
I hope colleagues will agree that this underlines the need to reform our Rules of Procedure .
However , I am concerned that Mrs Kauf@@ man &amp; apos ; s proposals would lead to the citizens &amp; apos ; initiative process becoming bog@@ ged down or hamper@@ ed by onerous bureaucratic requirements ( like Member States having to check every signature and pre @-@ certification certification by the Commission that it is legal ) .
The Commission is well aware of that .
Mr President , I welcome this report because it raises issues that need discussion .
I would like to make three brief points .
How can the Commissioner justify bringing forward these proposed changes at a time when there has been a major review of the common agricultural policy ?
Mr President , the chairman of my group , the PSE Group , has spoken about the necessity for action now .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , this is indeed a challenging situation .
That is the main difference , as we see it in the Commission .
That is a safety precau@@ tion we should retain .
On the key issues raised this afternoon , of course we would all support simplification , such as a common set of rules .
US foreign policy does not want a strong European involvement in the Middle East or anywhere else despite some verb@@ al assurances .
As the head of Parliament &amp; apos ; s Israeli delegation , I wholeheartedly congratulate both the Israeli and Palestinian Governments .
Madam President , may I draw your attention to an issue which is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of our Parliament as well as for our political weight , both individually and collectively .
We must reach a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen , and for that , we need from our European leaders real political courage and less of the waff@@ le .
Such conditions are the competence of the Member States , as is the decision on volumes to admit - if any .
A few years ago I read the Court of Auditors &amp; quot ; report on a number of these fisheries agreements which raise particular questions and doubts as to whether there are benefits to the countries concerned .
It may be that we need to ensure that these control systems are transparent and obvious to all .
With the support of the EU @-@ US US Senate leaders , I will look to move forward on that at the forthcoming TEC meeting on 17 December .
I expect to see a better relationship between Parliament and the Commission in the interest of all the countries in the southern Mediterranean area .
I think this is quite a good idea , so you do not limit people that see special difficulties in the new challenges in some parts of the European Union .
I think it is a very good initiative , but I have my concerns about its implementation .
We are trying to create a system where we would have a European Central Bank acting in the interests of the European economy .
Let me say to the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office that I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of my Group to wish the Berlin Council well , and to say that we hope you will achieve the objectives of Agenda 2000 which are now more essential than ever .
So let our Heads of State and Government talk to Mr Putin about oil and gas , but do not have them min@@ ce their words about an increasingly dictatorial regime .
This is because research is about knowledge , and knowledge is truly a European strength in global competition .
I think it is fair to say that the proposals that we have put forward go right to the heart of the issues that are raised in the White Paper on reform and it is extremely important for us to demonstrate that the reform of our external assistance programmes is the flagship or one of the flag@@ ships , for an overall reform process .
Mr President , I wish to begin by just reminding the House of a few statistics .
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90 / 4@@ 24 .
The broadc@@ ast and investment quotas we put before the House today are therefore necessary to underpin European programme creation .
In relation to the more general question of speculation by traders , it is difficult to know exactly the balance , the exact role that speculation has played in prices .
That applies to the Commission and to Member States .
The fight against climate change is a global action , and the active involvement of both developed and developing countries is necessary .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , there was a very interesting discussion on this matter at the level of the Member States , almost all of whose representatives were - I should point out - women .
In cooperation with the Czech Government , we will consult the Canadian authorities in order to get more information on the reasons behind their decision and we will make all the necessary efforts to restore visa @-@ free free travel .
While the European Parliament should be scrutinising developments in Afghanistan , I believe its contributions should be constructive and look towards achieving a stable Afghan state .
Sadly , so far at least - although next week there is a vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &amp; apos ; Rights - we have yet to see a Commission proposal which includes an ethical dimension .
It has been said that there is no immediate response , but changes are being made .
We should not underestimate the length of the journey that we are beginning today by starting on this legislation .
We should , therefore - while restoring confidence in our financial market - particularly improve and simplify measures in order to accelerate implementation of structural and cohesion funds .
You are correct , too , that there is a co@@ gn@@ i@@ tive dis@@ son@@ ance between reality and political debate , that we need to get the politics right and give Europe a compelling nar@@ ra@@ tive .
I do not believe that there is a need for additional legislation relating to soil protection .
Throughout the region , we are making progress on visa liberalisation and people @-@ to to @-@ people people contact .
And as well as maintaining spending , we need to spend better .
The requirement for the Commission to present a report , within six years , will also give us the option to revisit this important area and properly assess its impact in practice .
The ECB very much appreciated the favourable comments contained in the European Parliament &amp; apos ; s draft resolution on the ECB &amp; apos ; s monetary policy strategy in 2003 .
Without confidence in the standards of foodstuffs , the entire basis of our agricultural industry is put in jeopardy .
It has not yet been approved by the Commission , but I hope it will be a major step forward .
Sa@@ ying this , we encourage governments to come together and decide on as short a timeframe as possible for agreement and ratification of a Treaty according to their national requirements .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s experts , together with all Member States , are in the process of finalising the adaptation of requirements and the new global schedule .
Firstly , we need to be focused in our aims .
Once again we were reminded of the potential disastrous consequences of such accidents .
They must be seen to take forward an agenda that is relevant to the concerns and the lives of the ordinary families of Europe .
The Commission will certainly look at that with a constructive , pragmatic and open mind .
The resolution that Parliament adopted in early December was a timely and strongly welcomed initiative .
But of course such a plan will require enormous costs and econom@@ ical sacrifices .
This important initiative addresses the Kurdish issue through dialogue and within the framework of Turkish democratic institutions .
Equally , if we are talking about road safety , what is to stop the Portuguese and Italian Governments from improving road safety on their roads ?
However I do not accept what he suggests , that it is a matter for the Member States to make a case to the Commission .
Many of these are the poorest pensioners , who are on a very low fixed income and could already be living below the poverty line .
Member of the Commission . - The Commission welcomes the positive reception of this legislative proposal by Parliament in the plenary yesterday .
I would like to have a &amp; apos ; treaty plus &amp; apos ; - in other words a second edi@@ tion of the Treaty .
This will remain a central priority for the Commission in the years to come .
However , the impact of violence on women , young persons and children amounts to injury or the risk of injury to their physical , mental and psychological health .
This would better respond to the need of combating corruption in the Union , as corruption is also seen as a cause of the economic crisis .
For example , the EU Troika Heads of Mission did so during their visit to the Central High@@ lands last week .
I could have talked about Japan .
Mr President , I would like to say what a pleasure it is to be here this afternoon .
In conclusion , I believe that the &amp; apos ; no &amp; quot ; votes against the Constitution should be taken as a wake @-@ up up call to those who believe in and support the European project to focus on what matters .
Mr President , I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach .
Good cooperation with Member States on this issue will be essential and I count very much on Parliament &amp; apos ; s support in this context .
If we look at the track record of the European Union on its involvement in many conflict areas around the world , we see that the arms industries have been part of that problem .
But of course what we have instead is standardisation .
I think you will have to come forward as fast as possible with a global plan .
Wednesday evening provides an opportunity for the Commission to give an answer .
We define our price stability as a rate of inflation of no more than 2 % .
The issues of migration , social integration , justice and security are also of mutual benefit and visibility .
I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs because the work they have done has helped us tremendously .
For this reason , it is crucial that customs authorities and the Commission are allowed to exchange VAT information .
Therefore , I have three remarks to make .
Mr President , it is a great pity that R@@ ol@@ f Linkohr is not with us this evening for the presentation of this report .
We have to recognize - it is a very un@@ pal@@ at@@ able thought - that most of the medicine we take does not actually effect a c@@ ure : it only relie@@ ves the symptom@@ s .
The continuing reform process is key to enhancing the euro area &amp; apos ; s production potential and ensuring future growth and employment opportunities .
We have to bear in mind that we have to be very careful to keep the market balanced .
But we know very well that there are divergences in the approaches of the Member States .
This is why I have voted in favour of this resolution .
Why did you not tell it between March and December ?
Mr President , the minutes of the last part @-@ session session mention your speech in which you talked about incidents that took place in Strasbourg in December .
This report is an acknowled@@ g@@ ment of this and a recognition that the EU &amp; apos ; s high standards and wealth of agricultural experience can be of a wider value in addressing global food security , including by providing funding for fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers and high @-@ yield yield seeds , as well as training and practical support for farmers and food producers .
The Commissioner &amp; apos ; s answer says this is all too difficult .
I would appeal to the Commission to so@@ ften the severity of these proposals and find a better way .
Of course , it would be possible to arrive at such a very generous interpretation of the Treaty , to allow the EU to tackle the matter .
In addition , we have far more of a tradition of parliamentary scrutiny .
Firstly , I congratulate both the rapporteurs for successfully completing the m@@ am@@ mo@@ th budgetary task , and also the chairman of the committee , Mr Wynn , for getting through the votes in record time .
On the contrary , they came too late .
Mr President , I also would to thank our rapporteur .
The Commission is closely following the situation in the country and would not rule out the possibility of opening consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement .
Our Union would have no raison d &amp; apos ; être or functional purpose if it did not have as its main objective to offer a fair , comprehensive and efficient service to the people of Europe .
Turning now to the report , the recitals of the plan correspond to the measures that are later outlined in the actual provisions .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission takes note of the decision of Parliament to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution accompanying Mr Cashman &amp; apos ; s report until the next parliamentary term .
C@@ lose cooperation in the energy security field is indispensable and the most effective confidence @-@ building building measure , both within the European Union as well as between the Union and its neighbours .
However , seven EU Member States have still not signed this Convention , and eight Member States have still to ratify the UN Op@@ tional Protocol .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I think we should be clear what this motion for a resolution is not : it is not a re @-@ run run of the rather controversial and contentious report that we had last year ; it is not about how to get a political solution to the territorial dispute and conflict over Kashmir .
At that time it was proposed to create a common market organisation for eth@@ y@@ l alcohol alone .
I should like to thank you , Madam President , for writing a letter to the Greek authorities about the plane spot@@ ters , and for what you said today .
Men@@ tion was made there of a new direction for Europe : moving away from the social regulation agenda of the 1980s towards enterprise , innovation , competition and employment .
in writing . - I supported this report which recognises that across the EU , women are more imp@@ acted by poverty , and that we need to work together to address this .
Alongside the rights there are obligations .
It is clear that a large proportion of the measures needed to improve air safety should be geared towards preventing accidents , rather than providing a response when accidents have happened .
I think those amendments are very misleading and unhelpful and unfortunately , largely because of those amendments , my Group will abstain on the final vote on this report .
Issues such as this are always kept under review .
I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on the win by his home team in football today .
I am aware that in discussions leading up to the vote in the committee , certain institutional and legal issues have been raised which are of concern to some Members of this House .
If I had to sum up this debate , I would say that there were a lot of innovative , interesting and positive suggestions coming to the Commission &amp; apos ; s table .
We understand that proposals on this matter will be forthcoming in 2002 .
Finally , I feel the leaders &amp; apos ; involvement is going to be central as these are difficult decisions that need to be made at highest levels of government .
Some of these countries rely on us as their major export market and the source of their imports .
Concerning ethics , it is quite clear that we have to maintain the high ethical standards and principles that we have always followed and pay proper attention to that .
It is a very important initiative .
The work we are doing in this respect is likely to fuel our determination as we move ahead .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the candi@@ dat@@ ure of Mr. Mario Dra@@ gh@@ i as next President of the European Central Bank for his great competence and his progressive view on the governance of the global financial system .
The whole result not only improves the security of visas , but , as others have said , also convenience for visa applicants .
During the conciliation procedure the European Parliament delegation was able to reach a compromise with the Council , which is close to the original amendments on all the major questions .
The EU is an important supporter of peace on the Korean Pen@@ insula and exchanges and cooperation between the South and North .
The Court of Justice &amp; quot ; s jurisprudence on the purpose and conduct of infringement proceedings is quite clear .
This might be true but , on the other hand , I think it is important that we have put a bid on the table and said that we are ready to do this , provided , of course , that we get the green light from the European Council later this month .
I am sorry the Council is not here today to hear our objections .
Taking into account the lessons of the past , we stress the importance of competitive elections being held in all regions , in order to provide real choice among UN members .
Mr President , can I just object to the fact that the Th@@ or@@ ning @-@ Schmidt Schmidt report and the G@@ hil@@ ar@@ do@@ tti report are going to be voted on immediately after the debate ?
P@@ ast experience shows that fair and firm enforcement itself produces positive effects on competition across a sector .
We must make sure that we will never again give Saddam Hussein the means to pursue aggression against his neighbours , or indeed against his own people .
Madam President , on a point of order , we are holding a debate now with the Commissioner , not a debate amongst ourselves and amongst the political groups .
There is a place in Europe for ensuring that there is competition , not just in economic and in environmental terms , but also in the whole area of taxation .
I belong to those who are convinced that this would be a mistake of historic proportions , the consequences of which would ha@@ unt our Europe for a very long time to come .
&amp; apos ; Calls for public policies to promote infrastructure , equipment and public services ensuring general access for women to sex education and reproductive education , including control over their fer@@ ti@@ lity , and to support mo@@ ther@@ hood and fa@@ ther@@ hood , thus enabling women to plan their families and the other aspects of their lives and furthering all the conditions required for greater participation on a basis of equality &amp; apos ; .
Regarding the overall issue you mention , let me tell you that this crisis has made more than five million Europeans unemployed .
That border , which once separ@@ ated us in Europe , between the two sides of Europe , is now a free point of circulation among Europeans from all those countries .
Intern@@ ally , one of the main issues to be addressed in the synthesis report for next Spring &amp; apos ; s European Council should be how to move towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns in the EU .
That is the approach we are taking today but of course we do not participate in all aspects of NATO for exactly the reasons that have been well understood in this House .
It is the duty of all countries to support those countries that come under particular pressure at one time or another .
We must do more .
Stri@@ c@@ ter controls are necessary .
I am very conscious of the very different opinions that we hear on this .
The Commission &amp; apos ; s view as laid down in the White Paper on governance is that Article 202 ought to be changed .
It is for this reason that we are requesting that the Commission produce implementation guidelines to aid employers &amp; apos ; understanding of the risks and necessary preventative measures to ensure a consistent application of the directive .
We did so this time with those Members who were in the Chamber .
President of the Commission . - I am proud of the European Union for being the first , as far as I remember , to raise the issue with a United States President - a former President - of the need to respect fundamental rights and the rule of law , also when dealing with terrorism , namely regarding the issue of Guantánamo .
But we are very clear that a &amp; apos ; comprehensive and broad &amp; apos ; EU directive against discrimination which is essentially an open @-@ ended ended invitation to the Commission to produce yet more &amp; apos ; one @-@ size size fits all &amp; apos ; EU legislation in what is a very sensitive area will do little to address current difficulties and could even be counterproductive .
We will succeed .
The internal market is at the centre of what bin@@ ds us .
I have therefore suggested some compromise amendments which suggest that there must be a further and deeper dialogue about this which pays close attention to the points which have been raised without pre@@ judging what is the right answer to them .
Mr President , late last year , you and the High Commissioner for Human Rights , Ms P@@ il@@ lay , came to this Parliament and told us that the Goldstone report into the human rights violations on both sides in the Gaza conflict was thorough , objective and met international standards .
We can contribute to that through EU@@ J@@ US@@ T LEX and by building up a police corps that does not torture , but which knows what the limits are and tries to help restore order .
In terms of these regulations , a complaint which I have encountered is that the process of application is unduly burdensome and bureaucratic .
When we deal with legislation which intim@@ ately affects human health we must exercise great care and attention .
The question now is whether it would be useful to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights , in addition to having that charter .
Like my colleague from the Presidency , I also want to pay tribute to Parliament for its constructive role in this last phase .
That would be a matter that the Commission would need to consider , and the Council would lia@@ ise with the Commission on that matter .
The Commission also needs to take a strong position to protect the ban .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , after very closely following the debate , I would like to stick to my initial statement .
In response to the Member who mentioned micro @-@ credits credits , we want to assist in j@@ um@@ p@@ starting the economy and , for that reason , we are paying ar@@ re@@ ars to the entrepreneurs from the EUR 22 million that was a reserve programme .
F@@ our years later we are at the very initial stages of a common energy policy and energy security .
The courts , for instance , are striving from a very difficult position to try to retain some form of impartiality .
We should not leave it all to the Commission , still less to the Council .
With regard to the conclusions , I also welcome the progress made on better regulation .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission supports in principle the text of the draft Council Decision , because it is necessary to ensure that the provisions of mutual assistance and administrative cooperation evolve as far as possible in parallel , and it is necessary to fix the provisions establishing that the general budget of the European Communities will bear the costs relating to the use of the Customs Information System by the Member States .
First of all , I would like to say to the honourable Members that in the view of the Commission , the EURODAC Regulation is instrumental to the implementation of the Dublin Convention which determin@@ es which Member State is responsible for considering an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States .
I know I can count on the strong support of Parliament following the success of the second single European sky package last year .
This is important , and I say this to the President of the Commission and to all Commissioners : we need to ensure that we have a competitive European economy in order to have a social Europe .
EU environmental and food safety laws can form a safety net between farming and the World Trade Organisation .
Therefore any improvement in the position of individual farmers has come at the expense of employment in the sector .
That is the major challenge facing the European Council , which will be meeting soon with the aim of reviewing the programme .
They will explain how we would like to do it better , how to match the skills with the needs in such a way that young people will not be unemployed but will bring their potential to the European economy , and we will all benefit from that .
We should - in line respect to the precautionary principle - avoid the use of certain compo@@ unds for which we lack reliable data and independent scientific assessment on their consequences on consumers &amp; apos ; health .
in writing . - The Tre@@ m@@ opoulos report takes as its starting point the idea that transparency is a prerequisite to achieving the objectives of cohesion policy and I fully support calls for greater transparency in regional policy .
It now does have a mandate with the voting through and the start of the conciliation procedure .
On the social policy side I have another criticism .
The Com@@ is@@ sion must clearly indicate where institutional and personal responsibility rests .
That means , President , and I say this to you because you are a member of Parliament &amp; apos ; s Bureau , we need to restructure the committees of the European Parliament .
At the same time , I can confirm that the Commission is available and willing to look more closely into the effects of the regulation for parties domici@@ led in third countries and , in particular , states of the European Economic Area .
Mr President , this is a useful and very necessary procedure .
( Parliament rejected the oral amendments )
A website could be created to help overcome this at European level .
I speak for the European Union .
That is an un@@ attractive prospect , if we are going to have , through budgetary constraints , to retreat from the original ambition of the plan that we set forward .
This important change is further proof that the Greek Cypriots genuinely want a resolution of the long @-@ lasting lasting conflict with the Turkish Cypriots and with Turkey , which is occupying 40 % of the island .
These checks have revealed certain shortcomings in the compliance of some Member States with the Community legislation .
We should not rush into a debate .
I would also like to cooperate with Parliament to ensure that citizens &amp; quot ; complaints about violations of the fundamental rights mentioned in the Charter can be brought before the Court of Justice if an important issue of principle cannot be resolved in any other way .
I now move to more specific questions .
Some of that is understandable : we are operating in the most sensitive area of national sovereignty ; it has been difficult to bring together nation states with different interests and practices and clearly we have had to walk before we could run .
I hope that as part of the accession process Turkey will be persuaded to seek a political solution to the desire of the Kurdish people to express their identity , perhaps through some kind of political de@@ volution .
This is indeed crucial in order for Parliament to be able play its role in trade policy effectively .
We should also pay heed to lowering energy consumption through renewable energies , which will provide a solid basis for the sustainable future of the relevant countries .
We have to consider the consequences for citizens who live close to pollution disaster areas .
It sounds like a good initiative , but I will have to refer it back to the ministers concerned and feed it into the discussion process .
If we return to this Chamber ten more times to achieve that , then we should do that and keep doing it .
Our oral question is in fact an expression of regret that the Council is not entering into these negotiations .
Most of the amendments proposed can be accepted by the Commission .
But , of course , many of the changes in the common position which finally came back to us have to be welcomed , as they reflect many of Parliament &amp; apos ; s concerns , although some work has still to be done .
If we can iron out one or two little problems that still remain in his report , then we should be able to get a large majority to support it .
There is much food for thought in this report .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this agreement which will strengthen the contribution of EEA @-@ EFTA EFTA States in tackling social and economic disparities within the European Economic Area .
My second point concerns the resolution itself , which contained a call for new elections .
I just want to ask three questions .
It is becoming increasingly obvious that despite the massive investment of the European Union in the nuclear activities of the Eastern European countries , the European Union cannot dictate policy to other states .
Where would Europe have been if we had sat back and said , &amp; apos ; Look , we will not do anything until they have electri@@ fied the United States &amp; apos ; ?
International law has to be respected .
I should also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the rapporteur of the European Parliament , Mr J@@ el@@ ko Kacin , who drafted an excellent report on the subject , and to warmly welcome the resolution on Serbia &amp; apos ; s European integration process .
I find it very difficult to agree to Amendment 2 .
I thank the Commissioner most sincerely for that very comprehensive reply .
We really should discuss how to guarantee security of supply under all possible conditions .
Europol has been a success , but at a very small scale . It has worked very effectively at exchanging information across the European Union with respect to drugs trafficking , but it has not been extended to cover other areas : terrorism , racism , organized crime .
Thirdly , this is public expenditure through the European budget .
I hope the Commission can agree to that amendment .
In the interests of mankind we have a responsibility to keep searching for the right answers .
Pati@@ ents will have the right to get hosp@@ ital treatment in other Member States and be reimbur@@ sed as they would for receiving the treatment at home .
I believe that the European Union has a major role to play in ensuring that we tackle head @-@ on on the men@@ ace of international terrorism .
Unfortunately , it is not a problem in this area only , but a problem across the whole environmental spectrum .
The adoption of the resolution tabled by the European Union on the death penalty was a welcome achievement .
It is true that there have been several political statements promising that the interests of the new Member States will be taken into account .
The crucial reality of the enlarged EU is that amongst those covered by the term &amp; apos ; third country national &amp; quot ; are half a million people who are not nationals of any state , being former citizens of a state which no longer exists : the US@@ S@@ R .
And , even worse than that , our position is actually encouraging those elements both inside and outside Palestine which want this government to fail .
We now need to think about how we can re @-@ engage engage a political process .
It is that kind of endeavour that should and can be supported under the kind of proposals we are putting forward .
It is up to the candidates who wish to join the euro area to apply .
Many of your constituents will be present .
European citizens need to be convinced that the single currency will not be against their interest , nor that of their country .
You know how sensitive we are to these things .
It should be slightly smaller but it would just have been gesture politics to re@@ table the amendment we put in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market since it was obviously not going to be carried .
The &amp; apos ; Europe for Citizens &amp; apos ; programme ensures the continuity of the civic participation programme established for the period 2004 to 2006 .
But we must also recognize that process will be immensely difficult .
This must be a priority during the financial crisis .
First of all , I had the opportunity yesterday , during the one minute speeches , to hear the Honourable Member &amp; apos ; s intervention on this issue , and I share his concerns .
I can assure you that this year , as well as with the funding next year , we will put the emphasis on making sure that this question of protection is addressed and that the EU is there for people .
Only with an EU capable of sharing the burden and assuming its global responsibilities , an EU which is not just the sum of its parts , will we be taken seriously in Washington , be able to influence the policies of the Obama Administration and be in a position to enable the genuine transatlantic partnership that the world still needs .
The reason of course is to try and cover up the regime of enormous corruption which exists in that country .
I wholeheartedly congratulate Parliament , and in particular the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the two rapporteurs , Richard Corbett and Í@@ ñ@@ igo Méndez de Vigo .
The main reason is that Member States have more time to establish their method@@ ologies for obtaining reliable data .
This matter urgently calls for review by the Commission .
We have certainly not ruled it out . &amp; apos ;
It is very clear that it takes a lot of time and seems very complicated now and then , but at the end of day our cooperation produces solutions to problems that can only be solved through systematic cooperation .
However , I really want to focus on the EU @-@ Africa Africa Partnership aspect of that .
It is still not sufficient and I would like to draw the Commission &amp; apos ; s attention to the fact that in the Convention there are proposals being flo@@ ated to involve national parliaments in this debate in future .
in writing . - In its position at first reading , adopted on 18 May 2010 , the European Parliament approved , by a very large majority , 63 amendments .
Mr President , I too , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , fer@@ v@@ ently congratulate Mrs S@@ anders @-@ ten ten Hol@@ te on her report , which has certainly adopted the spirit of the amendments we brought in .
To continue in this vein it is my view that we must publish forecasts in a manner which accurately reflects their limited role in policy decisions and their inherent un@@ certain@@ ties .
Our security and well @-@ being being are increasingly intertwined and we need to work effectively together .
I believe we will move forward .
Let me say one last thing .
The Millennium Eco@@ system Assessment has underlined the need to take drastic steps if we want to avoid irre@@ par@@ able loss of the ecosystem services on which human wellbeing depends .
A certain degree of confidentiality is required to ensure full and frank political discussions among political groups , and the broadcasting of these opinions has the potential to do more harm than good .
The Liberal Democrats in this House agree with you .
I welcome the proposal and presentation , and wish us all good luck .
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities .
We absolutely need to prevent this happening again .
Europe will not truly influence America or world affairs unless we are able to resolve our differences and speak with a common voice .
In theory this may work .
This certainly does not deprive Member States of their right to express an opinion on the case or to receive detailed replies from the Commission &amp; quot ; s services .
Let me turn to the other proposed amendments on the recitals and the articles .
Finally , I very much appreciate all your comments not just on the report , but also what you have presented here as your concerns and ideas for the future .
I believe we need a more regional approach .
I want to come now to the point with which my colleague Mr Schnellhardt concluded .
Neighbour@@ s should be there for one another ; that &amp; quot ; s when good neighbours become good friends . &amp; quot ;
I thank him particularly for accepting paragraph 26 , to which I wish to draw the Minister &amp; apos ; s and the Commission &amp; apos ; s attention .
I hope that we can continue to make it even more political , and your comments have shown that we are here to discuss the political content and the overall balance .
Some argue that to require telecommunications companies to retain data they use for bil@@ ling purposes is an intru@@ sion into privacy , or that it imposes undue costs on business .
Moreover , the Commission continues to work resolutely on human rights , since respect for human rights is an essential principle of the European Union &amp; quot ; s external relations .
Can the President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office comment on whether the Council will deliberate whether we can have our meetings solely in Brussels and not have to come to Strasbourg ?
The Council understands that the honourable Member has also referred his question directly to the Commission , which is the competent body in relation to most of the issues .
The EU has to do everything it can to ensure free and fair democratic elections in this country .
I really think that we should give the House the opportunity to vote on the other amendments as put forward there .
With consensus seem@@ ingly breaking out between Parliament and Council , I was pleased to be able to support the Council &amp; apos ; s text and the agreed amendments , even if the latter were , in the end , not adopted .
I hope I have made it clear that the Commission shares the majority of the objectives set out in the report and that we very much appreciate the quality and ambitious nature of the proposal it contains .
As the rapporteur , Mr Bernard @-@ Reymond Reymond , says in his very fair report , Romania has experienced a range of difficulties and has probably not moved as far along the road to accession as we or they would have hoped .
There have been enormous improvements in the technology over the past few months since we first looked at this .
Furthermore , it is important to highlight the contribution of different cultures to the Member States &amp; apos ; heritage and way of life and to recognise that culture and intercultural dialogue are essential for learning to live together in harmony . &amp; apos ;
Mr President , the most striking statisti@@ c I have heard tonight is the one from the Commissioner when she indicated that it would take 2 500 years for us to reach a position of equality for women if we continue at the same pace .
All these factors will have significant political , structural and budgetary implications .
Such a centre would serve to create a more proactive approach to medium and longer @-@ term term industrial change which would benefit all those concerned - Commission , European Parliament , social partners , government and local authorities .
Madam President , I wish to express thanks to you , the rapporteur and my Scottish colleague , Bill Miller , for bringing matter before the Petitions Committee .
There is nothing much new for Ukraine , I am sorry to say , but it is great for the other countries .
Member States are divided on the issue : some wish to decrease this threshold , others support a higher one .
Of course , this is not the end of the story .
That is why a process is now established under our Presidency to seek to find a way forward .
We are now at a point where we see the limits to competence and to the geographical expansion of the Union being reached .
I believe that his approach is absolutely admirable .
That is now the political will of the European Parliament and no amount of lobbying by those who demand equal access to waters and resources should be allowed to undermine that .
I welcome its emphasis on attending to human rights in the Central Asian region ; an emphasis that the EU should apply to its external relations more generally .
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights , which has now reached the drafting stage .
We do not know how much it is going to cost this year .
The aspect of standards and production abroad vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis Europe has to be taken into account , but at the end of the day , the European Union &amp; apos ; s main duty is to protect its own , which is to say , the agricultural sector here in Europe .
Since aviation emissions have already doub@@ led since 1990 , to call for an initial allocation equivalent to average emissions over the period 2004 @-@ 2006 2006 , or even 80 @-@ 90 90 % of that , is simply too generous .
One right which EU consumers are entitled to is that of food security and safety .
That is the wrong road to go down .
This is a health and safety at work issue .
The main effect of this measure will be to make us in this House feel that we have &amp; apos ; done Something &amp; quot ; .
I hope that Member States will cooperate with the Commission in this work .
The Commission considers that the text agreed upon is balanced and , as set out in the Commission &amp; apos ; s statement to Parliament , attra@@ cts the Commission &amp; apos ; s full support .
I totally agree with them .
This report might be my last in this Parliament and , Commissioner , I am not proud of the result .
Colleagues have referred to the European security and defence policy .
I would even go further back than that .
Practices such as so @-@ called called social or environmental dumping need also to be confronted and , when necessary , new means of tackling them should be seriously considered as a matter of Community interest .
Yes , it is up to Member States to set specific targets and adhere to them , but the European Union has an important role to play in improving the exchange of best practice .
It seemed to me reasonable to support his proposal .
The Commission has indeed put some of these questions to the Court of Justice for resolution .
We must look at governance in Europe at many levels : the region , the loc@@ ality , and entities which are lower than the loc@@ ality in terms of current governmental structures .
That is not by any means the case at the present time .
This is a deeply unsatisfactory issue dealt with unsatis@@ fac@@ torily by the Commission .
Let her death not be in v@@ ain .
We will have to revise it and work and change it for many years to come , but it is the one game there is in town in combating climate change .
As Mr Lamassoure said , we are introducing a totally new la@@ yer of participatory democracy which will complement the representative democracy in which we operate in the European Union .
Their clear expectation is that visible results be achieved within a reasonable time .
These promises must be realised .
We talk about creating the world &amp; apos ; s largest single market here , and we talk about making the EU the most competitive economy in the world , and we talk about the world competition , yet what do we do when it comes to tax competition ?
And that means looking at the big problem we have in the European institutions of policies , on the one hand , that want to deliver positive change and policies , on the other , which contradict and undermine that .
We have all welcomed that and have tried to move forward .
The European Union stands ready to support work in the G20 to explore and develop a financial transaction tax at global level .
However , I share the Court &amp; apos ; s view that the Member States &amp; apos ; reporting is not yet satisfactory and the Commission will pursue its efforts to remedy this situation for the existing programmes , and also for the next generation of programmes and the shared management .
If so , it may well be that some people will say , &amp; apos ; well , Parliament has called on the Commission to look again at its proposals &amp; apos ; .
In conclusion , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur again for this good report and I am pleased to say that the Commission shares its general approach .
We all agree that climate change can be a win @-@ win win situation , where we can solve environmental problems and where we can create new jobs .
Within the framework of the Treaty , the Commission encourages Member States to use all the opportunities offered by European financial instruments - the structural funds , for example - for investment in cultural heritage projects .
We must do all we can in the European Union to make sure that the future is very different indeed .
The time for di@@ thering and delay is now past .
Now , the problem is how modern technologies can be used for environmental protection , and how industry or services should be helped in promoting the environmental value of the production .
The Commission believes the European Union should pursue dialogue with Gu@@ at@@ em@@ ala on key issues relating to the implementation of the peace accords , particularly as the country ge@@ ars up for the general elections scheduled for the end of 2007 .
Finally , on the investment issue , I should know more of the details of the fund which the Member is talking about .
So let us be clear : the Commission agrees with these priorities .
However , it was possible that it could have worked ; there was potential .
Indeed , we were really rather surprised in the Committee on the Environment that the environmental pillar of sustainable development should not be considered of equal importance to the social and economic pillars .
I welcome these indications of an approach , which were widely shared in the debate today , and , on behalf of the Council of Ministers , I can say that we want to work with you to resolve these questions in a positive way .
Palestinian reconciliation , and a government representative of the aspirations of the Palestinian people , is more necessary than ever .
If that does not happen , the integrity of the market is eroded .
Certainly that is what Croatia has done during the course of the last months : setting an example to its neighbours , demonstrating how rapidly it is possible to turn a country &amp; apos ; s political fortun@@ es around , given sufficient vision and political courage .
I abstained on the amendment which expressed regret at the suspension of the Chief Justice of Pakistan not because I disagree with the criticism but because I did not see it as relevant to this report .
Let me stress that Estonia would enter the euro area from a very strong position with credible policies , one of the strongest fiscal positions and by far the lowest debt level in the EU , as Mr Sci@@ cl@@ una illustrated .
I would certainly ask that this should not be allowed to spell disaster for business and agriculture in both jurisdictions .
The Commission will do its best to facilitate it .
In all this chaos , one thing is clear : air transport is enormously important for the European economy , and as individuals , we depend on a thriving and efficient air transport industry where safety for crew and passengers is the first prerogative .
Mr President , may I begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Skinner , for the excellent work he has done in drafting this report .
Women are increasingly achieving more top positions in society and this will continue to improve as , in my country at least , women are more successful than men in gaining universi@@ ty places .
We do not think that there is a choice between our security and our privacy ; we think that we can actually secure both .
We have taken note of the significant progress that has been made .
So I would rather hope that this policy , as some have said , is really supported by you .
I hope that this will take place sooner rather than later .
The asymme@@ tric nature of the trade agreement is crucial and involves the systematic elimination or reduction of tariff barriers and other duties .
The Commission intends to contribute to the preparation of the international donor conference that will be convened probably by the end of April .
My group argues they can add to profits and to jobs and give our economy a new competitive edge .
That is why I asked my question and the C@@ ommis@@ i@@ oner did not answer it .
We have to strive very hard to ensure that does not happen .
Firstly , if this agreement is less favourable than the existing bilateral arrangements then the more favourable shall prevail .
( The President declared the two common positions approved as amended )
I also broadly agree that biogas is one of the best ways of processing biomass in Europe .
They travel by different forms of transport .
The relevant details are set out in the Commission &amp; quot ; s proposals to put such quotas into Community law .
The added value of working together is what the EU is all about in public health policy , but this all comes at a cost and we should be very open about that .
Concerning dialogue , which was underlined here as important , I must say that we have tried to do our best to have good dialogue with Parliament , with the Committee on Budgetary Control and with the Court of Auditors .
They all lack the financial and human resources to deal compe@@ t@@ ently with applications to stay .
The new agreement is one way to do this .
Obviously , we are giving it proportion@@ ally much higher attention than the Member States are doing .
Again I say that this report is not helpful .
The public perception is that the Commission has acted more expeditiously this time than it did the last time .
That is why it is crucial to create a better environment for research and development .
Mr President , I too would like to extend my deepest sympathy to our Spanish colleagues in the face of the latest terrorist murder by ETA .
We in the European Union must build upon this .
I therefore welcome the idea of a working committee between the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets .
Mr President , on behalf of its southern neighbours I would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency .
The two points I have made show it to be falling very short .
Mr President , I too wish to add my congratulations to Mrs Bar@@ th@@ et @-@ Mayer Mayer on her excellent report and in particular on her work in drafting compromise amendments to take on board the many additional amendments submitted to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
These are increasingly being brought to the attention of Members of Parliament .
He said : &amp; apos ; This Parliament brings together representatives of all of Europe &amp; apos ; s main political parties .
Cro@@ p rotation or incentives through research and rural development policy can help .
The European Union thus engaged in an enlarged neighbourhood policy extending as far as the countries of the South Caucasus region and aimed at deepening its relations with the countries located at the EU &amp; apos ; s external borders , promoting their security , stability and development and preventing new divisions on the European continent .
However , we will do ourselves no favours by rush@@ ing into ha@@ sty and ill @-@ prepared prepared responses .
In any event , the Turkish security forces should exercise restraint .
I trust that the vote will confirm the orientations set out today .
I speak not only on behalf of the Presidency , but I am glad to say a unanimous General Affairs Council , which was consistent with the previous undertakings agreed at the December 2004 European Heads of Government meeting and was able to open those accession talks for full membership of Turkey back on 3 October .
In particular , I congratulate my colleague , the rapporteur , Mr Florenz , on the passion he has sustained on this issue , despite all the various problems he faced from industry and the different political groups in this House , not least his own group .
This is a good example of the pragmatic and efficient use of limited resources .
I will say very shortly a few words about each of these points .
Our twin reports in Parliament on human rights in the world and human rights in the Union demonstrate the importance we place on this issue .
As the Prime Minister stated , we could be mutually supportive in achieving good diplomacy in the Middle East .
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and my colleagues on working together to achieve the compromise formula and definitions , which have covered a very complicated and technical set of issues .
Secondly , we have always supported a peaceful reconciliation through dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama &amp; apos ; s representatives .
The plan also stipulates that Turkish troops of occupation will remain in Cyprus forever and that Turkey - an inv@@ a@@ der of Cyprus - will be a guarant@@ or of the independence of Cyprus .
We need to deliver this as part of a coherent EU contribution within a coordinated international response .
These are vital not only for both our regions but also for the entire planet .
Mr President , I would like to talk about the last in@@ dent of paragraph 25 , which will be up for a separate vote and which I hope we will be able to delete from the report .
I am sure that , during the discussion that we will have with Member States , all Member States will have the opportunity to set out their specific situation as input into the discussion .
However , we think that human rights are the foundation for democracy and democracy is necessary to develop and protect human rights .
In doing so , Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak .
We also welcome the compromise amendment , which lo@@ wers the threshold for the registration of political parties from a third to a quarter , which is in the interest of both fairness and pluralism .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Of course , I can only share your concern .
Mr President , the aim of EU 2020 should be to free the potential of the European citizen .
Re@@ as@@ on@@ able protection of intellectual property rights is essential for the future survival of the creative industries .
But we all know that it is going to be extremely difficult to reach one .
The report states that directives have not been implemented .
Europe must act on two fronts :
Member States and regional advisory councils must be able to propose alter@@ ations both to the geographical scope of the plan and the exact arrangements designed to reduce fishing efforts .
They will need to adjust their policies .
Lastly , Mr Prodi , will you organise a public platform for the leaders of the candidate countries that will be joining the EU ?
However , that need is not always reflected in the rules that we apply to our police .
Basically it will mean that Member States who have some sort of conscience about environmental protection and public health will be side @-@ lined lined because the Commission will decide and negotiate with the United States .
That is the aim of this postponement .
These programmes will allow institutions in the fields of education , training and culture to improve the way they operate together .
Regarding the energy package , we had to deliver totally new legislation .
The European Union can take a large share of the credit for giving the impetus to the G20 and feeding it with ideas .
However , it is now time to look at the re@@ balancing of the fru@@ its of growth and , where we see that wages lag behind and are a smaller part of GDP , it is also time to look at re@@ balancing this .
rapporteur . - Madam President , if Members look at their e @-@ ma@@ ils ma@@ ils and all the requests from lobbyists and industry , and the pro@@ s and con@@ s on the climate , they can conclude that climate is very clearly back on the political agenda .
In relation to your comments about the slow response , we need to look at that because there is the problem of a le@@ thar@@ gy in the European system in terms of response .
We do not believe that the amendment insisting on call @-@ back back is appropriate to this particular piece of legislation , which my colleague O@@ lle Schmidt has described as being very carefully balanced after the common position of the Council .
I know in the major scheme of things this might seem like a detail , but we have a responsibility .
On climate , this year will be critical .
We need a clear picture of the other measures that are planned towards this end and how they will combine to bring it about .
I will conclude by saying that , above all , we should remember that this is a political process , not a technical one .
Therefore , it is so crucial to send a clear message that the EU &amp; apos ; s priority is real changes in the human rights situation .
Mr President , it is my pleasure to be here tonight for the debate on Mrs in &amp; apos ; t Veld &amp; quot ; s report on the communication on state aid for innovation .
And , only then , we have the definite proposal from the Commission .
I would like to stress the importance of the issues addressed in this report .
If the EU has anything to offer , it should be a single @-@ minded minded condemnation of terrorism , together with humanitarian and reconstruction assistance .
We call on the Commission to ensure genuine decentralisation in the development and implementation of programmes .
in writing . - I voted to give discharge to the Trans@@ lation Centre .
There are also serious social problems .
I believe in equal treatment , and we can deal with an opinion .
in writing . - I was disappointed to have to abstain on this report , which should have followed up on the Commission &amp; apos ; s Green Paper in looking at how farmers across Europe get the maximum benefit in the marketplace from the high standard of their produce .
Would you not agree , Commissioner , that Taiwan is a beacon for democracy in the region and that the isolation of Taiwan is increasingly anomal@@ ous ?
Climate change is happening and , while mitigation efforts are essential , they must be complemented by an EU strategy that allows us to adapt to the effects global warming will have on our everyday lives .
In terms of effectiveness and thorough@@ ness , the findings of Parliament and those of the Court of Auditors encourage the Commission to continue further improving its performance .
How are we supposed to explain in Prague that the European Parliament is in danger of taking apart the Oostlander report because of an argument with the services of Parliament over the timing of this debate relative to the Committee on Budgets &amp; apos ; hearing on the financial aspects of enlargement ?
That is the reality of human rights abuses .
I would like to express my appreciation to Parliament for the timely preparation of its opinion on this proposal .
My report on the ECB &amp; apos ; s 2008 annual report was drafted in this context .
Chan@@ ging the law is a very important instrument to fight violence against women and children , but we need to go further .
So please convince your constituencies and help us convince the Member States , and not only the Spanish Presidency , which is very convinced .
The reason why the European Union displayed such strong unity and solidarity in the wake of 11 September is because we appreciated that contribution , and value the strong transatlantic alliance .
It is important also that the EU engages constructively with Belarus where , notwithstanding our differences , we must engage positively in areas of mutual interest , like border controls , and in order to encourage reforms and democracy and discourage self @-@ isolation isolation by that government .
I am particularly disappointed that Parliament &amp; apos ; s proposal to provide an additional EUR 150 million to address some of the serious economic and social consequences of the current crisis in white @-@ f@@ ish@@ - f@@ ish@@ - dependent areas has been blocked by Member States , in particular the UK Government .
Quite the opposite , we are motivated by a genuine interest to see that media freedom is a reality for the benefit of our citizens .
The third point which strikes me as arising from this report is the importance of a mandatory system to assess the proportionality of further legislative initiatives .
Clearly that will involve a number of Member States .
Madam President , I too would like to join the calls for a European directive on freedom of information , freedom of the press and media pluralism .
In some areas we lay down detailed legislation - which the Member States have to comply with .
As all of those Members have said , it is important we listen to the people .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like , first of all , to thank you for this very interesting debate .
We need this , and we , here in Parliament , want to get it done , but it has to be done in the right way .
The odd thing of course , in Britain &amp; apos ; s case , is that harmonised energy taxation on fuel duties would also probably reduce our taxes .
Aff@@ or@@ dable imports of protein from third countries such as the US are crucial if we wish to ensure food security and create conditions in which farmers can earn a decent living from agriculture .
As such it may not be transformed into a more serious piece of legislation for some years .
I believe that this House stands ready to play its part .
Ensuring that whatever is done can be done properly is something I think this House would be very keen to see .
We feel very strongly that a significant amount of time and attention must be focused on making sure that regulation is effective , i.e. that it helps the process rather than hin@@ dering it .
Some others , it would be fair to say , will need to be discussed over time .
This evaluation process is taking place in the wider context of the report .
We have raised concerns about the situation of prisoners in Russia in the human rights consultations and we have reminded the Russian authorities of the need to respect internationally recognised standards .
By the very nature of it being a compromise , there are things there that Parliament has had to give up , particularly on the scope , where we would have liked to have seen a smaller distance before the regulation ki@@ cks in .
Let us be very frank about this .
It will offer the EU the opportunity to act in line with its ambitions , underpinning the Lisbon Treaty &amp; apos ; s CFSP provisions - to be not only a pay@@ er in conflict situations , but also a player .
As with climate change , action is needed now and the Commission is fully involved in this .
We need to try to bring new ideas such as this one to the fore .
Good practices exist in some Member States and these good practices should be shared with other Member States for the benefit of all .
However , my key point is this : as the EU is based on the principles of free competition , we are committed to ensuring , not only in theory but also in real life , that in each Member State the consumer will be able to choose freely and without any difficulties between different electricity producers and distribut@@ ors and to decide which is the best offer .
So here we need an answer .
Pro@@ visions on consent vary across the Member States .
We must therefore take advantage of this and continue our efforts to ensure that all people are given the fundamental rights that we have worked so hard to preserve .
Madam President , I too should like to join with my colleagues in welcoming the Jackson report .
in writing . - I have finally voted in favour of the report , known also as the annual report on the CFSP , mainly because two of our five amendments were adopted ( the one on the Transatlantic Legisl@@ ators &amp; apos ; Dialogue and the one about the expectation that a strategic relationship between the EU and China will be developed ) .
The External Action Service should coordinate the work of different Direc@@ torates @-@ General General and create a Directorate @-@ General General for cultural and digital diplomacy .
I am equally grateful for the support of the rapporteur and this Parliament for the programme aimed at enhancing the participation of Latin America in the information society .
While it will not be my responsibility to endorse the arrangement , I would like you to be aware of the problem .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the European Parliament for its collaboration on this proposal .
On this occasion , I would like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to Mr Lehne and the whole working party : Ms Diana Wallis , Ms Dagmar Roth @-@ Behrendt Behrendt , Ms Re@@ be@@ cc@@ a Harms , Mr Hannes Swoboda and , of course , our rapporteur , Mr Paul@@ o Rangel .
Therefore my question to you , Commissioner , is : when will the Commission come up with a plan under which Mr Barrot , Mr Kovács and Mr Verheugen take on their responsibilities ?
This is the same principle as in Amendment 19 . Therefore , if the plenary adopts that principle , it will also apply to the four paragraphs I have mentioned .
The issue , for example , of renation@@ alization of the common agricultural policy , on the basis that such a development is impli@@ ed by a process of simplification of the common agricultural policy , means in effect its dismant@@ lement , and certainly would not be acceptable .
Mr President , I too thank all those who have represented this House on the Convention .
Madam President , like the previous speaker I am a new Member in this House but I had the privilege of representing the Committee of the Regions and speaking at an anti @-@ racism racism seminar earlier this year in Brussels .
This is certainly a few steps in the right direction , but we still need to sort out the problem of network unbundling and also access to other markets .
I would like to say to the honourable Member that I think she has , in essence , raised a very similar point to the previous questioner .
4. in order to clean the Internet of sp@@ am and punish those who make it circulate ;
I commend my colleague David Martin for his all too ap@@ posite report , which I will be supporting .
I trust that on this basis we can consider that we have a political agreement and that the Commission proposal can go forward for adoption by the Council , as amended following the adoption of Parliament &amp; apos ; s opinion .
If it is fundamentally the case that , despite past anim@@ osity , there is now the will for peace on both sides , could the Commission and Council not play a more active role in bringing the two sides together ?
Then I am sure , soon thereafter , that we can also deliver on the requirements of the fund .
I hope that he will continue to monitor individual Member States &amp; apos ; implementation of the directive , although it may be down to them in detail to implement it .
Secondly , the meeting scheduled for 11 November 2002 will not now take place and I hope we can move an oral amendment to make the point more general in terms of wanting EU involvement at all levels in these discussions .
Madam President , at the outset I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report which had the unanimous approval of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
- Mr President , I add my thanks to Mr Florenz for his report but I think , am@@ id@@ st all the congratulations to the rapporteur and to the committee for its work , we need to face some c@@ old facts : the EU is still doing too little , too late .
I do not really care what termin@@ ology he uses , but it is important , when the European Commission is getting rid of unnecessary regulation , that there is a place , as I said to you in our meeting earlier , both for better regulation and deregulation .
That does not prevent the institution involved from responding to this particular draft recommendation and recti@@ fying the matter , and I will take that into consideration for closing the case .
This agreement is beneficial for the EU Member States , as Turkey is an important transit country for migration flows to the EU .
I pointed out to Members of Parliament raising this issue in Johannesburg during the summit , as I had to , that we had not come there with new rules and that it was not in our power in Johannesburg to change these arrangements .
The challenge is to reach full agreement within the next week or so .
I trust this regulation will not be either misused or abused in that regard .
. Mr President , is there anything the EU does not seek to control ?
Mr President , when Mr Dimas replies to the debate in a moment , I would like to ask him if he can specifically reply and give us the opinion of the Commission on Amendments 1@@ 11 , 112 and 94 and the amendments that the previous speaker has just mentioned about nitrates ?
P@@ ast experience shows that such agreements can road test liberalisation solutions and become stepping @-@ stones stones for the future evolution of the WTO .
If the Treaty of Nice is rejected by one Member State it is not valid law , because the proposed Treaty changes do not command the unanimous support of all the Member States .
This Parliament appreciates the fact that we have had Ministers such as Rob@@ in Cook , C@@ lare Sh@@ ort and many others addressing Parliament and attending its committee meetings .
I can tell the Prime Minister this : if the European elite do not allow the people to speak , then , in the end , they will find other ways to make their voices heard .
The Council meeting could have made clear its determination to fight the protectionist threat to Europe &amp; quot ; s prosperity and the functioning of the single market .
We rightly believe that a similar agreement should be found in the other transport sectors .
On the other hand , if he would like to share with me the information he has wa@@ ved before this House today I shall certainly look into the matter that he has addressed and I will make sure that a reply is forthcoming to him .
I do not see adequate account of the rights of individuals to a fair trial , to fair presentation of charges before them .
I am very happy to tell the House that it is Commission policy that we pursue this issue in the Convention .
Finally , I welcome the continuation of Parliament &amp; apos ; s working group on the peace process , which will meet again this week .
Alternative and complementary solutions are not to be ruled out and are also being analysed .
From my point of view , I look after the fiscal matters of the Union , insofar as I am allowed to do so by the Member States .
Madam President , instead of the empty ges@@ tures that we are getting from the Liberals and the British Conservatives on the issue of British beef , can we hear what the Commission has to say on Friday .
The introduction of the euro will give the European Community a monetary presence that corresponds to its economic and commercial influence in the world economy .
Although no conclusion could be reached in a single day , I can tell you that they have set up a working party between the chairmen and intend to meet again and to come up with a conclusion .
This Parliament , and the European Union as a whole , takes a very strong view on the death penalty .
Should you decide to reject the common position , the Commission will not submit a new proposal .
I hope that Parliament understands the reasoning behind the decision to reject or to accept in part only some of the amendments put forward .
Therefore , I am very obliged to , and wholeheartedly thank , the Hungarian Presidency for changing the attitude in the Council and for getting the Council into a positive mood and positive mindset in looking for ways in which we can best ar@@ range the relationship between the Council , Commission and Parliament in managing the register , because the political signal that three institutions are taking this issue so seriously , and that three institutions are going to tackle the issue of transparency together , will be a powerful one .
Thank you , Mr Prodi , for your presentation and your documentation .
We have a culture of reality that farmers are not getting enough from the marketplace to give them a decent income .
We believe that Turkey would make a valuable contribution to the peace and security of our region .
But if we were looking at the world properly , all our summits would be about sustainability .
But at that time , and indeed up until the European Council itself , it was not clear how far we would be able to go .
We do not , therefore , support movement towards establishment of an EU diplomatic service or the &amp; quot ; commun@@ it@@ ar@@ isation &amp; quot ; of foreign policy ; the extension of Europol competence into operational areas ; or measures that will lead to the development of a European Ar@@ my .
It is obvious that today in Europe , even the biggest Member States do not have the necessary influence or leverage to talk on an equal basis with the United States or China and other powers , but together , the European Union can make a difference .
I am not saying we agree with everything in it , but we endorse the core passage .
I detect increasing ner@@ v@@ ousness in this Parliament about the potential impact of the accession of Turkey on the Union .
There is political fatigue in central and northern Europe about supporting the countries in trouble ; there is reform fatigue in southern Europe about carrying out the necessary reforms .
Is it intended to make it mandatory on national governments to implement such a regional policy , thus providing jobs in the regions to sustain rural communities and provide off @-@ farm farm employment for farmers who do not have viable farms and other rural d@@ w@@ ellers ?
But again this was not taken up by the committee or by the Arias Cañete report .
I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for our fruitful discussions and our work on this report .
I am not against embr@@ yo research - as an in@@ fer@@ ti@@ lity su@@ ffer@@ er myself , I have benefited from it and I have don@@ ated surplus embryos for research purposes - but we need to be sure that to achieve the aims that we all want , we do not focus in one direction only , while negle@@ cting other areas of research which hold equal if not more promise of success .
I can assure you of our best endeavours in the critical days and hours that lie ahead .
I think that it is most urgent for the Members of the European Parliament to strengthen their struggle for cohesion .
The Commission is bringing forward a communication on problems of the elderly .
It will inevitably lead to distorted economic policies which take insufficient account of other worthwhile policy objectives for the conduct of macro @-@ economic economic policy , and by that I mean growth , investment and employment .
Currently we are , of course , looking at the 2010 budget , and there are still a lot of issues to be resolved before we can agree that .
While the Liberal Group does not regards CAP reform as a precondition for enlargement , it is clear that significant reform of our farm policies is essential to the success of enlargement and also for other reasons .
In relation to disarmament : do we want to include Hamas m@@ ili@@ ti@@ as in the Palestinian security and police forces ?
Other bottlenecks include the spir@@ alling rate of unemployment and enormous insecurity in the labour market .
I also believe that we in the European Union must put our house in order .
Do not m@@ ed@@ dle in this , even if there are problems between Parliament and the Committee on Budgets and the Council of Ministers .
Equally , we will support the creation of a UN environmental organisation , which will further consolidate the central focus of our actions in the field of the environment .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs . - Mr President , the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs very much welcomes the increase in the area of freedom , security and justice but also believes that , before taking up new measures and programmes , the existing ones should be properly evaluated and that those evaluations should be taken as a base for drawing up the new programmes .
As I said , the presidency and the Council &amp; apos ; s concern is with cooperation and the protection of the external frontiers of the European Union .
However , I fully agree with the elements in the resolution - and I am sure this will be followed up in a number of speeches today - which recalled the importance Belarus has , not only for the European Union , but also for the stability and prosperity of the whole region .
. The state of permanent constitutional upheaval which is a characteristic of the contemporary EU is a major short@@ coming in our constitutional arrangements .
We should deploy new technologies in order to fight climate change .
That is what the debate must be about .
Mr President , Moldova has come a long way since the M@@ olo@@ to@@ v @-@ R@@ ib@@ b@@ ent@@ ro@@ p R@@ ib@@ b@@ ent@@ ro@@ p pact divided Europe into spheres of influence and Moldova became part of the US@@ S@@ R .
On the positive side , the report sets out some very good standards for trade and social and environmental fields , which Greens absolutely support , and in that respect I think the report sets a very important precedent for further upcoming parliamentary responses to other free trade agreements , with India and ASEAN , for example .
I look forward to continuing this discussion .
This is a sensitive question , but I think that it would be a further step forward in improving the popular legitimacy of Parliament and the quality of our law @-@ making making .
This budget fundamentally comple@@ tes the process of enlargement budgeting and it is a good result for the European taxpayer .
Even greater , therefore , is the responsibility upon us , the imperative to focus on how these interventions can be delivered to those who need them .
And that is the goal of the financial services action plan .
I should like to thank the Czech Presidency for a ful@@ some response .
The common agricultural policy clearly must be examined and adjusted in an attempt to strike a balance between on the one hand providing proper support to our food production industry , and on the other hand ensuring that good value is achieved for the expenditure of public funds .
I hope the Commission will take up this suggestion .
Mr President , I hope that this empty Chamber does not reflect our lack of interest in what happens in Russia , however understandable the situation is here on a Thursday afternoon .
May I point out that the Commission does not hesitate to pursue infringement proceedings , but only , as the Latin expression goes , as an ultim@@ um re@@ medium ; in other words , only when all the avenues and possibilities of settling matters in an amic@@ able way have been exhau@@ sted does the Commission take that step .
At least people come here to the Parliament and they are heard and listened to .
We are attached to this and we believe that this agreement , as it stands now , responds to the concerns expressed by Parliament after its first vote .
The European Union needs a strong , legitimate and accountable Commission , capable of providing political vision and leadership .
Europe has to speak with one voice and play its part in ending this aff@@ ront to justice .
The protocol on the system of public broadcasting in the Member States , annexed to the EU treaties , recognises the Member States &amp; apos ; freedom to define the public service remit to organise public service broadcasting and its funding , as long as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community .
Of course the Republic of Cyprus is the internationally recognised state but we should do more to recognise the rights as well as the duties of the Turkish @-@ Cypriot Cypriot community .
There are three key issues : firstly , it makes the European Union more democratic ; secondly , it makes it more effective and , thirdly , it makes it more understandable .
At the last minute there were some difficulties and the matter was reconsidered in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , but I believe that the difficulties and concerns that were raised have been adequately dealt with .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I should just like to bring to the attention of the House a technical amendment that we should make pursuant to Rule 15@@ 5 .
My second point is not directly related to this report but is worth making again and again at every possible opportunity .
I look forward to your assurance that liberalisation of energy will take place in a very strictly regulated framework which protects the environment and takes heed of social consequences , some of which are very serious .
I tabled an ad@@ den@@ d@@ um in the name of my group this morning to include those items and I hope very much it will receive the support of this House .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I fear that as I get into the first paragraph of my speech , there will be only me , the PPE coordinator , and the Commissioner left in the Chamber .
I refer back to the country @-@ of of @-@ origin origin principle .
In response to the European Parliament , the Commission initiated a two @-@ stage stage consultation of the European social partners , in accordance with the Treaty provisions .
This builds on the aston@@ ishing success the European Union has had in helping other emerging democracies - in our region , our southern neighbour Greece - to catch up and develop a strong private sector driven economy .
Failure to do so would undermine the goal of extending Europe &amp; apos ; s zone of democracy and stability .
I called for the question to be amended to ask the Council to ensure a fair and free ratification procedure .
However , as part of the package , the Commission was requested by the European Council and Parliament to assess modalities for their inclusion in the EU reduction commitment by mid @-@ 2011 2011 , and to make a legislative proposal as appropriate .
We have strict rules in place that regulate the movement of waste within and outside the European Union .
In parallel to the proposal to mobilise the Solidarity Fund in favour of Portugal and France , the Commission has presented a draft amending budget ( DA@@ B No 9 / 2010 of 13 October 2010 ) in order to enter the corresponding commitment and payment appropriations in the 2010 budget as provided in point 26 of the IIA .
We also know that we will have to take into account previous agricultural offers made by the EU in the Doha Round , of which Mercosur is expected to be one of the main beneficiaries .
Concerning the bilateral relationships - EU @-@ Russia Russia or EU @-@ Ukraine Ukraine - I think it is clear that the energy supply and transit aspects of the new agreements currently being negotiated have taken on a new importance and will be there .
That is wrong and Parliament is right to say that at some future date we should be challenging this in court .
We have all come a very long way since last August .
First of all , I want to assure you that the Council remains determined that the perpetrators of crimes in S@@ reb@@ ren@@ ica , in Bosnia and Herzegovina , as well as elsewhere in the region of the Western Balkans , must be brought to justice .
I would add here that Europe is the most significant player in the region .
Second , the Commission proposes to overhaul the disciplinary procedure .
Other Member States have enacted only a few amendments , and the number of changes made of course depends on several factors including the existing regulatory framework and also the internal organisation of Member States : in federal states , it is more complicated than for others .
However , I am prepared to listen to colleagues and accept that there are very real market implications to the proposal which are needed to control sulphur .
The regulatory framework is clear .
As the last speaker I have two points to make and one question for the Commissioner this evening .
This worrying level of inflation rates results largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months .
The first example is our one @-@ minute minute speeches .
We also look to the European Council to consider ways of raising awareness amongst European citizens about the work of the European Union and the relevance of the EU to our daily lives .
When you see this proposal being rejected tomorrow morning , you should go back to the drawing board and come up with a new piece of legislation .
Mr F@@ é@@ re@@ t and I have sharply different political opinions .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I find this debate rather risi@@ ble , almost lau@@ g@@ ha@@ ble .
I beg you to vote against all amendments tabled to this joint motion supported by these four groups and support the motion as it has been agreed by these four groups that are of very different political stances .
Clearly , the effectiveness of the Service will necessarily structure the work of the High Representative but , in the medium term , its work will reson@@ ate throughout all the institutions of the European Union .
It is very difficult to comment on a specific case when I do not know the detailed circumstances , but I do not think we should be afraid of an open debate with those who disagree with us and we should welcome a lively debate on different issues .
Liberals and Democrats believe that the European Union has experience to offer in everything from restoring Iraq &amp; apos ; s devast@@ ated infrastructure to advis@@ ing on the drafting of its new constitution .
We also have to see how the charter is applied when Member States implement EU law .
Mr President , I understand that Mr Davies may have made a speech about a situation concerning myself , and , therefore , I would like the right of reply on that matter .
This is a guarantee .
Mr President , since the problem of global warming cannot be solved by the EU alone , my oral amendment seeks to enlarge the audi@@ ence by adding the words &amp; apos ; and the international community &amp; quot ; after &amp; apos ; EU and its Member States &amp; quot ; .
The report clearly artic@@ ul@@ ates the need for the European Union to &amp; apos ; pun@@ ch its weight &amp; apos ; at the United Nations .
My congratulations to the rapporteurs and to the Commission .
Therefore , I would kindly ask all my honourable colleagues to vote against this change to the agenda of this House .
I would like to commend the Commission on its S@@ C@@ M 2000 programme and of course , in the context of the Teverson Report I would like to thank Mr Teverson for taking on board my own Group &amp; apos ; s amendments in committee to this report .
I should also like to inform my colleague , Mr Stubb , that there was more than one group leader in the Chamber for the duration of the debate .
Trade is the driver of economic growth and , in the right circumstances , it spre@@ ads prosperity , but it is not a panacea and does not automatically lead to poverty reduction .
I ask for your support for that .
But our resources are already stretched to the limits .
Estonia &amp; apos ; s application deserves our support and I hope that , when Parliament votes on Wednesday , a convincing majority will give the Est@@ on@@ ians the credit they deserve and demonstrate that the eurozone is very much alive .
If there is no agreement in the OECD , I still think that the right thing to do is to commence negotiation in the WTO .
This is another cornerstone of EU policy .
I would like to highlight very briefly three very specific elements .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this own @-@ initiative initiative report on energy issues which can@@ v@@ ass@@ es many areas of energy efficiency , supply and conservation .
We need more competition , more transparency and no discrimination , but the good news is that 42 % of volume , above EU thresholds , is already going to SMEs in the European Union , which is really significant support .
First , it will facilitate cross @-@ border border energy trade with the establishment of an agency for the cooperation of national energy regulators , with binding decision powers , to complement national regulators .
Fortunately , in a democratic society this is rare .
It is time now for the UK to say this phase is over .
in writing . - I voted for this resolution on Ukraine .
The strong monetary growth also should not , for the time being , adversely affect the outlook for price stability .
We must respect differences and give a proper and meaningful role to the different religions in the European Union , but we expect mutual recognition .
Such an initiative would , in my view , restore not only consumer confidence in food but also public confidence in the EU itself .
As to le@@ c@@ tures in human rights , we all - regardless of our record - need to be le@@ c@@ tured on human rights .
The idea was to set clear targets for the EU and Member States , clear deadlines and follow it up .
The other is economic .
OLAF &amp; apos ; s work demonstrates that this cooperation should be enforced , but I must also say that there have been two very important events during the five @-@ year year tenure of this Commission in which OLAF has been extremely instrumental .
It is important not just for the safety of the environment but in particular for human health and safety .
This time I put essentially the same point for the second time in one month and hope for some kind of an answer .
It has repeatedly stated its commitment to provide the necessary resources to facilitate re@@ integration and resettlement of the refugees once real progress has been made .
That may be important - the sensi@@ tisation and femin@@ isation of policies within the Commission and within the rest of the Union - but the key should be to spend money from these budget lines on women &amp; apos ; s projects in the developing countries themselves .
This situation is quite pathetic .
I hope therefore that all the European institutions will be willing to proceed on that basis .
I would like an explanation from the Council - and I have tabled an amendment to this effect to the Obiols i Ger@@ m@@ à report that we will be discussing later - why there was no European strategy ?
. Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Mulder for the very collegi@@ ate and cooperative way in which he has worked with other committees , and Mrs Gill for the same reason .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank all the participants in the debate and the Members of the European Parliament for their clear support for a commun@@ itarian approach , for a strong European Union , and for an appropriate role in the future mechanism which we are discussing today .
Yes , we must look also at the question of the weighting of votes in the Council .
Unlike the last speaker I would like to congratulate you , Commissioner , on your threat to cut off European funding .
Now there are at least two views within that majority .
Whilst I have no difficulty with the general tenor or the general intent of this directive , a number of facts have to be recognised before we give greater protection to those who are in temporary work contracts under the a@@ eg@@ is of agencies .
Clearly we have made huge leap forwards on European defence cooperation in the last 12 months or so , but there are certain things we need to bear in mind .
The strong condemnation of terrorism &amp; apos ; in all its forms and manifest@@ ations &amp; apos ; was certainly a welcome political statement . But we must now work on fulfilling our pledge to conclude the comprehensive convention on terrorism by September 2006 .
Ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary arrests and de@@ ten@@ tions , torture and extra@@ judicial killings have been documented .
In this respect , we must also ensure that fund &amp; quot ; s financial resources match its geographi@@ cally and themati@@ cally enlarged scope of application .
The Commission understands the concerns that have been expressed and it therefore intends to work with Member States to look at the issue in depth and identify the appropriate course of action to ensure a high level of protection for consumers .
I believe that great sensitivity , tolerance and compas@@ sion must be employed whenever it is proposed to employ the environmental standards of a developed economy to the economies and environments of emerging economies .
Madam President , we cannot but express aston@@ ishment and dismay about what we have heard today , particularly from the British Foreign Office gentleman .
We deeply regret this and will try to find other ways to increase cooperation between Member States .
With reference to Article 32 of the framework agreement , our proposal , which is a political decision at this stage , is intended as prior notification to the other institutions and , in line with established practice , the legal act of withdrawal will be taken in three months &amp; apos ; time .
It is absolutely crucial that we should work together in this very important area .
Under these circumstances , the Commission can accept Amendment No 2 and the first paragraph of Amendment No 12 .
As you know , the Commission is already working on the subsequent road map measures .
British Conservatives believe in a very different vision of the EU to the one represented by the Lisbon Treaty , and we are rightly forming a new political group in the European Parliament to champion our vision .
We must deal with it on a practical and political basis , but with frank@@ ness and determination .
Mr President , like other Members here today , I have been lob@@ bi@@ ed extensively about this directive and I have been impressed by the degree of support - or at least the support in principle - for it .
Does the Minister accept that to be able to look at an example of having spread openness and transparency and having enhanced the ability of national parliaments to hold ministers to account would be quite a significant achievement ?
We must encourage that intelligence and creativity by having infrastructure , training and everything else .
I have to say , in passing , that I have also not had any approach from the Irish government on the Council suggestion that the Irish government would want this matter raised .
That should be a guarantee to the European people that we are on our guard , not only to fight inflation , but also to fight def@@ lation if it were to emerge .
We will have hard and difficult negotiations with them but the dialogue has to start somewhere .
First , the market is globalised , organised crime is globalised , poverty is globalised and the wa@@ ves of immigrants remind us of this reality every day .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the Piecyk Report on the EU &amp; apos ; s maritime policy .
The Commission very much welcomes the decision to rectify that omission and looks forward to the debates that will take place on the strategy document which is going to come forward shortly .
It is vital , as Mrs Wallis , has said , that the consumer is aware and informed of this option .
EU Member States are making a decisive contribution to the expanded UN@@ IFI@@ L peacekeeping force in support of the rapid extension of the Le@@ ban@@ ese Government &amp; quot ; s authority throughout Lebanon .
They will subsequently have to look at their situation in the newly elected Parliament after the elections , as will every group , on the basis of the verdict of the electorate .
In 2008 , the Commission will present to Parliament and to the Council a report accompanied by a proposal in view of an entry into force in 2010 .
So@@ und economics , realism and results are what citizens are demanding and what are needed to continue to build the European project .
I sincerely hope that the Tampere Summit marked a step away from For@@ tress Europe , as claimed by the EU Presidency .
Prime Minister Blair , your presidency is taking place at a decisive moment for Europe .
Mr President , food safety has been high on our parliamentary men@@ u for the past three years .
I am very grateful for the work of this House , for the work of those who have travelled there and for the contributions I have received .
Thirdly , the opening of negotiations on the relevant chapters depends on Turkey &amp; quot ; s compliance with its contractual obligations to all Member States ; failure to meet these obligations in full will affect the overall progress of the negotiations .
As a result of this , an article fe@@ at@@ uring him recently appeared , in good faith , in a national Sunday newsp@@ aper .
There is a regulatory and supervisory cost that should be evaluated .
But let me just make a comment .
It is certainly not clear to the House that we have agreed to vote on urgencies that have failed to be discussed .
It is also with great interest that I read the report of the Development Committee , which provides a sh@@ re@@ w@@ d analysis on the matters at stake .
So I thank Mrs Vlasto for her cooperation and congratulate her on an excellent report .
There have been numerous bilateral talks but so far a final political settlement has not been secured .
It is precisely because so many governments have failed to grasp the ne@@ ttle of radical reform that the Lisbon process is in such dire stra@@ its .
Now , for many of our farmers , that would seem an unfair position to have , and I would respectfully suggest tonight that , yes , we can impose standards until we are sure .
As far as the Evans report is concerned , I am also speaking on behalf of the PPE Group .
I hope that means the path towards finding a solution is clear .
I welcome the amendments tabled by Mr Ford and Mr Swoboda , which strengthen the resolution .
No campaign against international terrorism is served by operating outside of international law in its most fundamental aspects .
We need a joint political commitment of Congress and this Parliament working across the transatlantic divide to fight the threat of terrorism which affects us all , and indeed we need to protect above all our fundamental rights and freedoms .
To this end , I welcome the fact that , as part of the work for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue , the European Parliament has invited P@@ ope Ben@@ edi@@ ct , the President of the African Union , the Dalai Lama , the Secretary @-@ General General of the United Nations , the Chief R@@ ab@@ bi of the United Kingdom and the Gr@@ and Mu@@ ft@@ i of Dam@@ as@@ c@@ us to address the European Parliament during the year 2008 .
Obviously , there is active surveillance of the situation .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank all the Members for their contributions .
I do not believe that the extension of qualified majority voting to taxation matters at European Council level is a particularly welcome development .
There will be growing impetus for companies to invest and evolve in terms of research and development and substitution plans .
I disagree with this aspect of this report .
Mr President , I seek clarification on the proceedings for the rest of today .
We have seen what that has led to in Indonesia .
However , amendments to the Euratom Treaty have been tabled for this process and , in regard to the IGC , will the Council meeting in Dublin make a statement on nuclear safety in response to widespread public concern ?
The European Union has also made through your presidency a wise choice in insisting that the reform process in the Treaties must be over and operational by the year 2002 so that it will facilitate early accession because it is important to ensure that the reform process should not become the enemy of the enlargement process .
We want adequate protection of new medic@@ in@@ al products .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , Ms Klaß , and the members of the Committee on Women &amp; apos ; s Rights and Gender Equality for their own @-@ initiative initiative report .
A policy which balances rights and duties , so that those newly arriving understand that they can work in their host country and enjoy free movement in the Union and other benefits of EU citizenship , would be helpful too .
That is my understanding : there will be a resolution , but not immediately .
Because those that produce unsafe toys know full well that those toys can and eventually , perhaps , will kill a child .
Ex@@ clusion may truly be the only answer , but this Parliament wants to try a little bit more to see if we cannot resolve this .
We are still awaiting this Commission proposal , in line with Directive 97 / 67 / EC , which means that the articles relating to liberalisation of the previous directive may no longer apply .
Mr President , this item on the agenda , as we know , is about debates on breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , launched in 2007 , will provide assistance of up to EUR 500 million per year and its rules provide specifically for gender equality to be taken into account .
There is no way that this can be a safe vote .
However , we do not want to jeopardise the directive if it is possible to reach a decision tomorrow , when you vote on this issue .
We can now look forward to future reviews of legislation and the work of the contact committee to ensure that there is no violation or abuse of copyright on the Internet or any limitation on genuine private use or fair use .
While on the one hand it is important to have a li@@ quid financial market so that the cost of money is not higher than it needs to be , on the other hand we should not allow this situation to continue un@@ checked for much longer .
We learn lessons ; we apply them , and we improve safety .
We must not establish new preconditions for membership that were not applicable to other potential members and we must remain clear that negotiations are for full membership and that that is our only goal .
I pledge from my side - and I know my colleagues will come with me on this - that we will spare no effort in working with the French Presidency .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the Prime Minister has told us that we should do whatever needs to be done to stabilise the euro but , in fact , this is only the minimum that is required to be done .
Report Ludford ( A5 @-@ 04@@ 36 04@@ 36 / 2001 )
Mr President , this is a very important subject for the fishing industry and for the marine environment generally .
In conclusion , I was both pleased and f@@ lat@@ tered when this report was referred to by President Chirac in his speech to Parliament some weeks ago .
However , whilst we fully support the integration of the Roma people within the European Union , we do have serious misgivings with regard to the involvement of the European Union on issues which we believe to be the preserve of individual nation states , such as access to health care , education , employment and housing .
Mr President , I think we should finally sign this agreement .
Renewable energy uses resources that will never run out and that many developing countries have in abund@@ ance : sun and wind mainly .
Turning to climate change , my colleague has already said that the summit should underline the leading roles that Russia and the European Union can play together in achieving results at the Copenhagen meeting .
We want to encourage you to continue as you have just said , so that the Czech Presidency will be as successful in its second half as it was in its first half .
The type of regulation that is absolutely essential for consumers can be damaging , disrup@@ tive and unnecessary if applied to professionals .
Well , the answer of course as we know - and the rapporteur has been clear about it - is to prevent Eurosceptics from forming a group .
We did that because we think that opening up freedom of movement of goods and people is so important .
We welcome the increased assistance in the agricultural sector , particularly in the life of what we have been told that there is now some recognition that reform has to take place .
It is a balance which should be struck . We want to find that balance .
Therefore , we need a constitutional debate and , in time - sooner rather than later - we need to decide on how we reform our structures so that they are more effective and democratic and so that the European Union can have more cl@@ out in external relations , in Common Foreign and Security Policy and in preserving the security of its own citizens against international crime and terrorism .
I cannot understand how the Council or anybody else could be surprised .
I reminded you further that the Member States have undertaken to coordinate their positions in the international organisations of which they are members or the international fora in which they act or participate .
From the institutional point of view , I repeat the question : why has the Council , even in the preamble to its recommendations , made no reference to Parliament &amp; apos ; s opinions ?
Shar@@ ing the same planet means a common responsibility for us Europeans and for Canadi@@ ans .
Parliament does not have the competence to instruct Member States on what to do in this area .
Finally , it is my view that it is regrettable that the European Commission has again come under attack in the context of the European Summit .
Membership of the European Union has brought enormous benefits to Ireland .
This is the point where we need your help .
Mr President , after an era of openness , tolerance and enthusiasm for Europe , we have seen in recent years a deterioration of our unity and a division among Europeans , even in this House , on issues such as freedom of movement , immigration , national interest and , above all , money .
Finally , I want to refer to the resolution on the IGC today , which calls for the issue of Parliament &amp; apos ; s two seats to be included in the mandate .
Nevertheless , the effects of climate change and of human activities in the Arctic region extend far beyond the Arctic itself .
Above all we need to engage with our partners to g@@ au@@ ge the real level of ambition and see if our ambitious vision of the round is genuinely shared by them .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , if the interim report from our Committee on Climate Change does no more than state the obvious , that is no bad thing .
It is , of course , a direct contra@@ vention of international humanitarian law to use civilians in this way .
This report does not try to simplify all these matters .
The free movement of goods and services is , of course , reflected in the original treaties of the European Union , and one of the focuses of our work in the course of our Presidency has been the completion of the single market .
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation .
We are grateful for your support .
This House , and the EU , are testimony to that .
The report before you sets out a useful strategy for creating lead supervisory practices in the EU .
Secondly , the vote now is different to the last time .
Mr President , I did not table these amendments this morning to create any trouble for this House .
This is especially serious in times of crisis .
That is why it is important to create an effective mechanism empowering the Member States , under certain conditions , to continue negotiating and concluding bilateral investment agreements .
Mr President , the central component of EU 2020 should not be stabilisation funds and ba@@ il@@ outs .
In February 2005 the Commission presented a draft Interinstitutional Agreement , an IIA , on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies .
Mr President , this concerns the way in which we interpret the Rules of Procedure .
Human rights considerations are involved here at several levels .
However , I see a further role for our Member States , for our so @-@ called called &amp; apos ; mature democracies &amp; apos ; , and this is leading by example .
The main aim of the Cohesion Fund was to help countries with the greatest structural disadvantages ; the beneficiaries of the Fund having a per capit@@ a G@@ NP lower than 90 % of the Community average and committing to adopt a convergence programme .
If we are to be more effective in our efforts , then it seems to me that we need to focus more specifically on such areas of genuine human @-@ rights rights abuse .
Our aim should surely be to set the best safety practices across Europe .
It is important to mention that this Commission work programme for 2007 contains 34 legislative proposals , representing 36 % of the total , 57 non @-@ legislative legislative proposals and one negotiating mandate .
Mr President , first of all there is a debate over whether the European Union should be discussing things in relation to common standards on procedural law .
We will pass a resolution confirming the appointment of the president later today on these terms .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , I do not accept this big crisis idea .
Mr President , I apologise as I refer not to this question but to my own question , No 18 . I am in the middle of an emergency meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &amp; apos ; Rights .
Of course , this also depends on the willingness of a Member State to simplify laws and procedures .
The reforms are important for those countries but also for the EU .
I urge this Parliament to ensure that this item is taken as early as possible on Tuesday afternoon .
This issue goes to the heart of Europe .
In the health and safety field as well , there is a need to update and modernise the legislation we adopted in the past : the pregnant women at work directive , five years overdue for review ; the noise directive of 198@@ 6 , ten years overdue for review ; a number of directives that need to be radically updated and modernised .
Again , I would simply take this opportunity to reiterate the sincere gratitude , both of the Commission , I believe , and certainly of the Presidency @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , for the tireless efforts of many Members of this Parliament in pursuing what was achieved in the United Nations Millennium Review Summit .
But best value can never be based on purely financial criteria .
Mr President , I fully support what has been said by our rapporteurs , Mr Díaz de Mera and Mr Ko@@ v@@ at@@ che@@ v .
I want to concentrate my initial remarks on women &amp; apos ; s and children &amp; apos ; s rights , as the rapporteur has chosen to focus on these important objects .
I insist that the agencies &amp; apos ; work programmes should express their contribution in operational and measurable terms and due consideration should be given to the Commission &amp; apos ; s internal control standards .
Apparently there are only a few delegations which favour that .
That is why I have included multiple discrimination .
We have tabled an amendment to this effect and hope the House will support us .
I also urge the Council and the Commission to take a decision on the full commun@@ it@@ ar@@ isation of the European policy .
I would like the Council to enligh@@ ten us as to what kind of proposal that might be .
We are particularly worried by the exp@@ ulsion of large numbers of Georgi@@ ans from Russian territory , which appears in direct contradiction to Russia &amp; apos ; s commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights and to the 19@@ 75 Helsinki Fin@@ al Act .
They gave enormous help , assistance and commitment to me and Mr Roche , my Minister for Europe , who is with me today .
So I would strongly endorse the point in Mr Brinkhorst &amp; apos ; s resolution - indeed it is an EPP suggestion - that we should have a f@@ iche finan@@ ci@@ ère , a financial statement , from the European Council at every single point at which it makes use of funds , so that we know where the funds are meant to be coming from .
Nevertheless , when this was fully discussed in committee , we had to accept the very strong legal view of the Commission that this would not be possible .
It should be a day , yes , to celebrate how far women have come , but , yes , also to raise awareness about how much further we still have to travel in terms of equality .
F@@ ighting terrorism is a global challenge , which not only affects us all but which can also only be successfully counter@@ ed if we work together .
The Court was rather critical of Commission controls in the research area .
Surely it can be raised at the forthcoming EU @-@ US US summit and also during the ongoing negotiations in relation to this issue .
Let me make four points in response to specific questions and comments .
The lack of legal certainty and the high costs associated with the current system whereby patents have to be vali@@ dated separately in each Member State is stran@@ gling the Internal Market &amp; apos ; s potential for development , innovation and growth .
Madam President , I too welcome the Commission statement , particularly as far as the op@@ tical radiation directive is concerned .
It is vital that those processes are taken seriously .
The Commission has been working intensively on economic governance and is ready to present its proposals on how to improve this next Wednesday .
Ad@@ verti@@ sing of tobacco products via radio and the sponsor@@ ship of radio programmes by tobacco companies would also be banned on the same lines as television advertising under the television without frontiers directive .
A very important element is cooperation and the strengthening and reinforcing of European @-@ level level supervision , which really has a grip on these phenomena at the top of the market and these new phenomena .
That is also why we have an institutional system such that when we do act at European level we can offer citizens the guarantee that the institutions operate to the highest degree of openness , democracy and prop@@ rie@@ ty .
E@@ vents have shown that the answer really was that we do not know and it will be made up as we go along .
We all know that that is the reason why .
I hope that this report , which we Commissioners were given last year , will in future include subsidiarity , better regulation and assessment of alternatives , while respecting the legislative authority of the Council and Parliament .
Mr President , in 2004 , this European Commission got the green light of the European Parliament only upon the solemn promise to be the champion of fundamental rights .
You have been clear about the importance of Europe and the Member States not imposing new and heavy @-@ handed handed regulation at European or national level .
There is a necessity and an urgency with regard to ensuring that those people who make investments in the tourism product and the tourism area are given the necessary back @-@ up up marketing and structural supports from the European Union programmes , which are sometimes denied them because they have already made capital investments themselves .
Unfortunately I cannot add anything further , even after this very professional debate .
The benefits of this agreement for the European Union are equally significant .
We will , in the light of the crisis , examine any proposal as quickly as possible , taking into account both the need for rapid help and the need to avoid distortion of competition .
In fact , I believe that the European Union , together with the United Nations , should continue to work to build peace and reconciliation on the island of Cyprus .
We have identified the right challenges and a set of viable solutions .
It is therefore extremely important that the directive is duly implemented .
I voted against it in committee and I ask this House to do the same .
We were then aware that , if we were to prepare this European Union to meet the historic challenge of enlargement to Eastern and Central Europe , the Baltic , Cyprus and Malta , it was incumbent on us all to secure an effective , democratic , open European Union which , more than anything , re@@ connected with its people , re@@ connected the vision , the hope and the aspirations which inspired the post @-@ Second Second World War generation to embrace European integration and re@@ connected that vision with the people .
We also expected that human rights issues would play a central role in negotiations between the Mexi@@ cans and the European Commission .
A pro @-@ European European , integrated Moldova would have a beneficial effect on the EU &amp; apos ; s eastern frontier , where weak governance and un@@ solved conflicts are a continuous threat to European stability .
Nevertheless , we take seriously the fact that we will now negotiate several readmission agreements .
I would hope that we can , in our voting , consider restoring that figure because it would take us up to what we originally proposed .
But if the cent@@ ri@@ pe@@ tal force for our Union is no longer coming from vision@@ ary leadership within , it will certainly come from developments beyond our borders .
This directive will ensure better protection of consumer rights in electronic communications .
I wish to look in particular at the Commission proposal and a number of our amendments .
The Commission has now embarked on a process of administrative reform which should embrace fundamental improvements in financial control both at the Commission and in the Member States .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , perhaps you will allow me , firstly , to say something in reaction to the Commission &amp; apos ; s statement .
Mr President , I supported this report because - as we have already heard - small businesses are the backbone of our economy .
We are talking about the full machinery of single EU economic governance .
It is on this basis that Parliament can examine and investigate all the transactions so that the discharge is not only a procedure , but rather a substantial assurance to the European public that Parliament supervis@@ es on their behalf and that a rigorous and thorough investigation is carried out .
Paragraph 3 does not reflect properly the intention of those who drafted the text .
Mr President , can I support both the report from Mr Böge and the resolution .
So we have made it a new area of discussion .
That is something that should be further discussed in the course of the negotiations .
This is an economic race to lead the world into the 21st century based on green jobs and sustainable living .
I certainly do not rule out this possibility but this will depend first of all on whether we have a new WTO round at all .
I have a very simple question .
Accordingly , I hope , and I sincerely believe , that we will have an agreement by the end of 2009 , one which will tackle climate change problems effectively .
However , any changes within the internal decision @-@ making making procedures must be balanced and fair .
Surely the time has come now to differenti@@ ate , to redefine , to tighten up the criteria as we do now in giving aid .
I agree with all the previous speakers with regard to the problems .
The momentum and focus which the European Council can provide is central to their success .
I look forward to our sharing experiences with each other through organisations across Europe at conferences and so on . It is a sad fact that the European Union has , over many years , engaged in a lot of pilot projects , but a lot of the lessons that have been learnt in those projects and programmes have not been main@@ stream@@ ed .
Most member governments did not submit their framework plans until the year 2000 itself .
That has been a high @-@ order order issue for the Committee on Industry , and we are very pleased with the success that she has achieved .
Finally , let me conclude by saying that there is a chance that , if we adopt all the amendments today , this instrument will be adopted by the Council in exactly the form that it leaves Parliament .
That means that we are failing to realise the enormous potential for growth and establish a framework in which millions of new jobs can be created .
Dear colleagues , I believe that on the basis of the overwhelming majority of positive comments and evaluations in this Chamber today by Members of Parliament , as well as the evaluations of the Commission and of Council , warm congratulations are due to Bulgaria and Romania .
I welcome the compromise reached between Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
I believe that we do a good job in terms of our legislative , budgetary and control functions , but no Parliament can work in the dark .
Under international rules , restrictions to imports of products must be based on legitimate concerns , not be discriminatory , and be proportionate to the objective pursued .
I think that is very crucial to all of us .
The key challenges for the revision will be to define the scope of the directive .
Finally , Mrs Gill , as far as our measures on the implementation of the regulation are concerned , the Commission is extremely strict when it exercises its role as guardian of the Treaties .
I hope we can persuade our American allies to continue their multilateral approach in international relations and to show this multilateralism in a practical approach in their relations with the European Union .
On the other hand , the Commission wants trade policy and our actions in trade bodies to have an impact and lead to results .
Right now that is one of the very few things that can deliver a result to the European citizen during your presidency .
It is also important if the Court is to place some reliance for its own audit purposes on the checks carried out by the various audit and supervisory services in the Commission , and in the Member States .
This was our committee &amp; apos ; s major concern .
It is a basic requirement for the efficient management for the programmes and the achievement of the agency &amp; apos ; s objectives .
Your confidence and support will help me carry this important task forward .
I would just like briefly to explain why .
However , given the various pressures on the environment , the Commission has proposed action to protect and nur@@ ture Europe &amp; apos ; s most remote and isolated regions .
I understand what you are saying about the need to first ratify the protocol , but can you tell me if work is beginning on certain specific areas where we can look for progress in the short term , so we can make people even more confident that these are not just words in a Treaty , but will actually result in specific action ?
One of the guiding principles has to be to listen better to citizens and their concerns , otherwise we will not succeed .
For many , for Turkey to open negotiations for membership means opportunities - opportunities for further democratisation of the country ; opportunities for abolishing torture and other violations of human rights ; for respecting the rights of religious and ethnic minorities within Turkey and for full respect of the identity rights of sectors of Turkish society , the Kurds and the Ala@@ wit@@ es .
If , in the future , food products derived from cloned animals are to be introduced on the European market , it should be done by means of a specific regulation submitted for public consultation and then democratically adopted .
We have to argue very strongly , as people have here , that we cannot afford not to make those investments .
I am very interested in what you say .
Instead , let us un@@ le@@ ash the full power of the EU institutions on the task of deregulation .
However , if we are to use this principle effectively to have serious political leverage to encourage reforms , the European Union itself must stick to its own commitments .
On the economy , you have said that barriers to the market - internal and external - must come down , and that Europe &amp; apos ; s answer to recession must not be K@@ ey@@ ne@@ si@@ an spending alone , but that we must strive for fairer competition , trade liberalisation , and fre@@ er movement of people and goods across national boundaries .
This is a key feature of our Europe of Res@@ ul@@ ts agenda .
I know that this is a very delicate issue for some countries , but we will have to deal with it in the coming years .
Food is an internationally tra@@ dable product and it is therefore very important that a coordinated and common approach is taken to promoting food safety in Europe .
This is the best way of making progress with these questions .
Only if Member States face the situation together , can a lasting solution be found .
But we in Europe must defend the principle of the family farm and must not allow others in the rest of the world to import into our area food that does not meet our standards .
I hope that the Commission will take them on board and respond positively .
The first is in contributing to the construction of an international human rights community : in all kinds of ways there has been increasing recognition that Europe must promote international standards of respect for human rights , for instance in the international criminal tribunals on Former Yugoslavia and R@@ wand@@ a , the agreement on the statute of the international criminal court , the Pinochet case , the intervention in Kosovo to stop ethnic cleans@@ ing - all these things have been developing momentum .
I wish to thank all the Members of the House who honoured me with their remarks for the constructive nature of those remarks .
There must be a workable solution .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I know very well that this is an issue that is very important in some member countries because of the victims they have had , because of the difficulties there .
I would like to thank the LIBE committee , Mr Coelho and the Budgetary Control Committee rapporteur , Mr Alvaro , for their excellent cooperation on this file .
I do agree with the rapporteur and with Mr Len@@ ar@@ č@@ i@@ č that Croatia has much work ahead .
We need to heed it .
So of course we have the right to state those demands .
Standards and requirements differ drastically and we urgently need an EU approach to that .
That has now been accepted , fortunately , as part of the deal , which means that no implementing measures of a quasi @-@ legislative legislative measure flowing from this legislation can come into force if Parliament rejects them .
Mr President @-@ in in @-@ Office Office , thank you for such a comprehensive answer to seven questions .
For instance , extending the field of qualified majority voting will immediately provoke ass@@ or@@ ted Eurosceptics and others to say in their Member States that their country is giving up the veto and giving up sovereignty .
However , we must take small steps .
I was very fortunate to have been invited this autumn to participate in the discussions between the Member States on how the EU human rights policy could be made more effective and more coherent .
Mr President , I would like to agree with the previous speaker .
I should also mention the overarching objective of seeking to ensure better integration of health concerns into all our policy initiatives , which I shall take forward with relevant colleagues within the Commission .
I believe they are going to do it .
We have to ensure that there is an environment conducive to these changes in Europe .
The values , the objectives and the rights of citizens must not be diluted .
I would urge them to do so .
It is a great honour and privilege for me to be able to introduce you to our House .
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services .
We need to think how different Iraq could be .
The Commissioner said that some Members opposed the agreement and others endorsed it .
These issues , as you know , belong to the past .
I do agree that the way forward is to support small business and provide long @-@ term term sustainable jobs , high @-@ quality quality jobs , and I do hope that the proposal for a small business act will help to achieve this in the long term .
If I have one major concern : we must not den@@ ude the new management committee - or committees , if it be that - of the valuable expertise which existed on the outgoing sectoral management committees .
Mr President , during the formal and informal debate on this issue over the last few weeks and months , both the Commission and the Council have indicated that it is not the business of the European Parliament to stick its no@@ se into the substance of WTO cases .
He said he was very relieved to hear that and would now get on with it .
We must promote the European Research Area , including the European Institute of Technology , which should be a flagship project and symbol of the knowledge @-@ based based European economy .
The White Paper is a first step , as you know .
Those are big political decisions .
I will now give the floor to Mr Watson who will speak on behalf of the committee responsible , the Committee on Citizens &amp; apos ; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
It allows us to have links with third countries such as the United States - why not - and also Russia and countries further afield such as South Africa and some of the applicant countries .
The Agency was set up to deliver aid fast and effectively to communities which were in urgent need of it .
There cannot be some rules for the larger countries and other rules for smaller countries .
Concerning the use of tax as a complementary regulatory tool in the context of financial market reforms , I can confirm that the Commission is considering comple@@ mentar@@ ities between the tax and regulatory instruments and will pay attention to the cum@@ ulative impact of these two types of instruments on the ability of the financial sector to support economic recovery .
This proposal is of great political significance .
Once again this re@@ sorts to a sort of la@@ und@@ ry list approach to legislative initiative and we as a group would like to see a much greater display of choice and political orientation as regards what the European Commission proposes to do from one year to the next .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , this subject is very dear to my heart , because it concerns children and their safety .
We need to very careful about that .
The Commission has already launched a feasibility study on this issue .
At the same time , this ban must be backed by effective action by Member States to prevent funds and other support reaching the L@@ T@@ T@@ E .
One of the key issues that emerged yesterday in our very long debate on the report of the special committee on BSE was the need to be able to identify and monitor cattle if BSE is to be eliminated .
For free trade to work , there has to be a level playing field and , yes , a safeguard clause such as P@@ abl@@ o Z@@ al@@ ba B@@ ide@@ gain &amp; apos ; s is useful , but the other signatory must also ensure that the agreement is indeed a two @-@ way way street , otherwise the Free Trade Agreement which should benefit both parties simply becomes completely one @-@ sided sided .
This is what is missing from all the debates on renewable energy : there is no legal base on which we can rely to ensure that we can have the research programmes , the promo@@ tional actions which cost money .
While I do accept that Morocco is an important ally of the West in the fight against terrorism , it is deeply regrettable that Morocco will not deliver on its stated commitments to the terms of the UN settlement plan .
Main@@ taining good neighbourly relations , including a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution on the main issue , remains essential .
The timetable , as I mentioned , was originally set for conclusion by the end of this year .
As in the case of Greece and Macedonia , these difficulties must be solved bilaterally rather than being drag@@ ged into the EU accession process .
Firstly , it is absolutely paramount that the help is activated as quickly as possible because , once the clock starts ti@@ cking , the Commission &amp; apos ; s hands are tied and they cannot extend it without legislation , and that will not happen for some time , if at all .
We need to do so , not to decou@@ ple the United States from the defence of Europe , not because we believe there is any weakening of the US strategic commitment to Europe , but to answer those in Washington who sometimes call it into question : the voices that claim , with some justification , that Europe cannot continue to depend on the United States to bail it out of European conflicts unless it is prepared to do more to help itself .
A majority in the committee also wants to see the Dublin transfers to such Member States stopped until failures are recti@@ fied - although there is an amendment on this issue which we will vote on tomorrow .
The EU can now v@@ indicate its claim to a place on the world stage by brokering this strategy .
Before this debate fin@@ ishes , can we hear more from the Council and the Commission about what room there is for u@@ pping our game ?
A democratic and firmly European Ukraine is key to a democratic , reliable and law @-@ abiding abiding Russia .
We would like to see how this can progress .
The whole model is in drastic need of revision .
I recognise that advances have been made to ease the financial and administrative burden on SMEs , such as the 2010 establishment of the SMEs finance forum , but urge the Commission to do more in order to create a more competitive and accessible economy for the SMEs which are so vital to the success of Europe &amp; apos ; s economy .
Let us look at the situation between 1990 and 1998 when , in what is now the euro area , five million jobs were created .
The European Union must make a stand .
Ladies and gentlemen , this is my proposal to you .
There is also the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights , which plays a key role in assisting the Commission to enforce its task ; and there is a Council of Europe Charter for Regional and Min@@ ority Lan@@ gu@@ ages and the framework convention for the protection of national minorities .
There are two issues which must be of concern .
Mr President , we can write all we like about human rights and we can report and discuss the issue , but unless we follow through on our intentions and the reports , they are meaningless .
We need a strong civil society , as Commissioner Frattini pointed out , one which is democratic , in which people feel they can participate and are not excluded on the basis of their race or religion .
We think a light regulation is the way forward but , I repeat , if we do not get satisfactory progress through that means , we will demand a directive and request legal intervention in this area .
I recommend we approve this report .
A significant proportion of European Roma face such sub@@ standard conditions - almost totally dis@@ connected from the economy resulting in their exclusion from basic human rights - that fostering social inclusion cannot be viewed within the framework of general policy ratification but must be handled as bridging one of the most enormous gaps in the fulfilment of constitutional and human rights in Europe .
Lastly , I have a precise question for the Commission .
However , major players now need to be more proactive in convincing countries with the highest levels of pollution : the United States and developing countries .
By carrying out a rigorous monitoring process , and by reducing the time it takes to transpose directives , Member States will be able to increase trade and ensure a well @-@ functioning functioning Single Market .
We must continue down this route .
As President Barroso knows from our discussions , there are problems with the Commission proposals in the field of financial supervision .
We must make it clear to them that we are willing to help them .
Two Member States apply a tax of this type , but I must point out that it also raises questions of international law .
Mr President , Prime Minister , anyone who heard the American President saying at the press conference after the summit with the European Union that &amp; apos ; we have had a nice meeting with these people from the European Union &amp; apos ; would wonder whether he was thinking about Mr Barroso , Chancellor Angel@@ a Merkel , or who ?
In many ways what we see happening is a convergence of ideals and goals between the US and the European Union .
First and foremost , Europe needs a coherent and harmonised internal energy market , which has to integrate different energy networks , linking them with each other .
I think that this strategy reflects our values , it reflects our principles , it reflects how we should come back to foreign and security policy .
Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Pirker for his excellent report and I am also glad to hear that the Commission supports the call of my country , Malta , for a fairer share of responsibility , even with respect to the Dublin Regulation .
Our committee thanks Commissioner Monti for his commitment to real and meaningful dialogue .
However , we find ourselves in a different situation even though we are making determined reform efforts .
It is extremely important that we ...
With this important piece of legislation , the European Union will stand ready to continue to effectively reduce and minimise the significant adverse effects of air pollution .
I can accept eleven of your amendments in the belief that this will enable the Commission proposal to go ahead and to be adopted by the Council .
It means empowered consumers and strong consumer protection as well as a business @-@ friendly friendly internal market legislation .
Let me also say that the amendment to limit it to one year , honestly speaking , to my mind does not make much sense : it would be better for you simply to vote against it .
Mr President , I very much welcome the programme and priorities of the Belgian presidency in the employment and social field .
I regret that elements of Mr Kon@@ rad &amp; apos ; s report water down the Commission &amp; apos ; s plan .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , the n@@ in@@ th round of Sin@@ o @-@ Tibetan Tibetan talks failed to produce any concrete results and has not improved the situation of the Tibetan population on the ground .
Allow me to conclude with a few points which should be made at this time of institutional deliberations .
So that is , I suppose , where the starting point for this debate must be .
So to conclude , I wish once again to thank especially Mr Whitehead for his excellent report and , indeed , for his support .
Parliament , at second reading , proposed a change to the commit@@ ology arrangements but , in the light of the Treaty of Amsterdam , I have not recommended that those amendments be supported .
Even more , we would let down the people in Russia who desire freedom , prosperity and safety .
It has to be left to some extent to individual countries and indeed regions as to how they work their way through this .
This will ultimately lead to lower costs , a standardisation of procedures and more importantly , less red tape and bureaucracy .
Most of the report is about financial control . That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee .
Com@@ pan@@ ies that are successful players in the European market are also well placed to compete globally .
I have promised Parliament that the Commission will bring forward a formal legislative proposal on a financial tax .
I also believe we should focus on decreasing dependence on humanitarian aid for some of the beneficiaries .
However , I am disappointed that reductions are being made in the overall budgetary allocation but I hope that the European Council , when it comes to reviewing the second reading of the EU budget for the year 2000 , will take on board the recommendation of this Parliament that it should increase the funding for the programme to EUR 67 million or I@@ EP 53 million in next year &amp; apos ; s allocation .
And while we have a proposal here that the Commission will report back to us in five years &amp; apos ; time as to whether we are achieving what we set out to achieve , I hope that the Commission will come back here each year and tell us in what direction things are moving - whether the proposals are working , whether things are getting better or indeed in some cases getting worse - so that we can introduce corrective actions , rather than waiting for five years before beginning to take alternative steps .
European Community policies have promoted the development of the she@@ ep@@ meat industry , but wo@@ ol is another product that it is possible to develop and add value to .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I am sorry to take up Parliament &amp; apos ; s time .
Two , the Code of Administra@@ tive Be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our should be observed by all the EU &amp; apos ; s institutions and bodies , not excluding the Commission itself .
Of course we keep our ideological differences and keep up the political debate , but we make an effort to have a stronger Europe .
Decisions are taken by the Council and the European Parliament - not by the Commission .
Vice @-@ President President of the Commission . - Madam President , after the remarks of my colleague K@@ are@@ l De Gucht on the general agreement and relations with the United States , let me concentrate on the future umbrella agreement on data protection .
You could have democrati@@ sed the EU with this Treaty .
Mr President , I would like to defend my honour .
I believe it is important to ensure that the changes take place in a controlled way , to allow all players involved the time to adjust and to guarantee the rights of all consumers .
I hope those rumours are not true , but if they are , I want those involved to think very carefully .
These demand our continued attention and cooperation , and we hope that Iran will share this view .
There have been many changes in the European Council in recent weeks , and the position of a number of governments - not only the Spanish - is changing , which creates some difficulties .
We must make more and better use of it .
It has never been implemented fully .
I am delighted that most of my amendments got through the committee , particularly those on anti @-@ discrimination discrimination .
Mr President , Slovenia is the first Member State which , having suffered under totalitarian Commun@@ ism , can now take the lead in Europe as a whole .
The Member States apparently lack the political will to fulfi@@ ll their obligations .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for that reassurance .
I believe that the result of this vote will send a positive message to the other Member States and that it will calm down some unfounded ap@@ prehen@@ sions .
I hope we make a better f@@ ist of things during the next decade and this regulation will provide us with some of the pro@@ sa@@ ic means of doing so .
I believe that human rights and the rule of law need to be the top priority for Parliament in the enlargement debate .
I hope that discussion on this matter will be open and transparent , as the Council should be .
The Commission and Parliament have challenged this before the Court of Justice , as they have done in other similar cases .
Madam President , this moment has been a long time coming .
Members ought perhaps to be aware that this is not a very nice way of be@@ having towards the staff of Parliament .
The consultative process is a significant element of the Group &amp; quot ; s overall review of its activities in this area .
I will just go very briefly through the measures that are envisaged .
The Turkish state is becoming more democratic .
This report goes a very long way to shar@@ pening up legislative procedures in the EU and therefore I welcome it .
Mr President , if you will indul@@ ge me , I actually have two points of order .
Mr President , this is an important report on an important subject and I congratulate the rapporteur on her usual thorough@@ ness and commitment .
The challenge lies in persuading members of the public of the need to change their ways .
I am glad that Parliament was able to make this legislation sensible by doing our job , and I am pleased to vote for it today .
It has helped to highlight the need for concerted Union action .
Last but not least , I really believe that these issues and debates very much help to shape energy policy , but there is no single instrument that provides for it .
This directive which is before us is a balanced piece of legislation which I am sure will be supported by all Members of the House .
The EU should not be m@@ ed@@ dling in military matters .
This goal shall be achieved through political dialogue , through recommendations , structured dialogue with stakeholders and , when appropriate , through infringement procedures initiated by the Commission against Member States .
We will work until we have solved these problems - there are hundreds of problems to be solved and I cannot do it alone .
I agree with the rapporteur that we need to promote CSR , but we also need to protect the enterprise , productivity , competitiveness and wealth @-@ creating creating capacity of European businesses .
Some of the proposals will be explored in the Committee of the General Assembly , in session from now until the end of this year . Others will be taken forward independently .
Finally , can the Commissioner ensure that Parliament will be kept informed ?
I noticed your choice of word there .
Mr President , yes it is possible to have such a framework which is why I referred to the proposals now before the Council made by the Commission .
The European Union will continue to monitor the situation in Guantanamo . We will do it carefully and will not hesitate to raise this issue bilaterally with the United States whenever appropriate .
Mr President , the main principles underlying the directive on working time are important and are indeed worthy of this Parliament &amp; apos ; s support .
I intend to make the most of that partnership in seeking to contribute to the deepening of a service culture to the benefit of EU citizens .
We also need to lead the way , as people have said , on ratification .
And so it is extremely important for the future of this Union that what is agreed at the informal Council on 11 March , and what is agreed at the end of March , can be supported by the public at large in Europe .
I realise this is a domestic issue , but it helps to point out a failure in the existing cohesion policy .
While there could be certain aspects of Parliament &amp; apos ; s adopted report that ECR MEPs do not support , we strongly believe that the legal basis of this regulation should be changed to fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative process and addi@@ tionally , that it should be accompanied by a thorough impact assessment .
To achieve this , we need to assess progress on this every year .
I also totally agree with Mr Car@@ ner@@ o González .
I would like to add that this is not a political but a technical issue .
The Commission will continue to give its full support to Croatia , which is working hard to achieve its goal of accession to the European Union .
My British Conservative colleagues and I welcome the broad approach of the Lambrinidis report and support the many positive and balanced elements of this report to promote the integration of immigrants into European society .
The greatest contribution to security of supply is intelligent use of energy , one of the regulatory requirements of wise liberalisation .
I would like to ask the same question .
Parliament &amp; apos ; s view at the first reading was , in my opinion , principled and far @-@ sighted sighted .
in writing . - The compromise reached in the Agricultural Committee on El@@ is@@ abeth J@@ eg@@ g@@ le &amp; apos ; s report dealing with milk quotas is satisfactory .
We have a Vice @-@ Chair Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties who was a member of the government at that time .
I would like to recall that the EU Charter also states , in Article 51 ( 1 ) , where and when those fundamental rights apply .
I am optimistic that support and understanding will be provided .
I again want to thank my shadow rapporteurs from across the groups , Ms Nedelcheva , Ms Wi@@ k@@ ström and other colleagues who helped make this what I would call a ple@@ asu@@ rable trialogue - if that is not a contradiction in terms !
Secondly , for my Group , the real substance of the programme of the European Commission is political .
I know that it is not on the agenda of the European Council in the beginning of March , but I would just really like to urge the German Presidency to continue the good work it has done so far in keeping it going .
If parliamentarians at all levels in Europe are to be engaged effectively , there must be open and public legislative debate in the Council .
The Lisbon Agenda has a noble objective : an objective of creating the most dynamic and competitive knowledge @-@ based based economy in the world , capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs , greater social cohesion and respect for the environment by 2010 .
in writing . - I have finally given my &amp; apos ; yes &amp; apos ; to this complex resolution ( R@@ C7 @-@ 0@@ 137 0@@ 137 / 2010 ) on the Non @-@ proliferation proliferation Treaty .
Mr President , as the first Irish person to speak in this debate , may I thank colleagues for their kind comments about the Irish electorate .
Mr President , I very much welcome the Lamfalussy report and the opportunity to comment on it , but I would like to start by putting on record my personal thanks to Mr Bolkestein for coming along at this late hour despite the inter@@ ruption .
That does not remove the obligation on the Council or the Commission to continue to make progress on a range of areas concerning Europe &amp; apos ; s future in the meantime .
Prime Minister , on behalf of the European Parliament , I want to thank you for that very remarkable speech here in the European Parliament .
Mr President , I am very pleased to be opening the debate .
However , there is also a need for a response from Member States in other areas in relation to the whole fishing industry .
We need to ensure that this is not the case .
I will try to see to it that it does not happen again .
We can be proud of our own role inside the process so far and we must not be shy of marketing Parliament on the strength of the success .
The Commission proposal tries to ensure that the necessary information can be collected without imposing too onerous a reporting system on industry , especially SMEs .
That is a decision that has to be taken between the Member States and the Commission . What they do will decide what happens to the moratorium , not what we do tomorrow .
The European Union has an overwhelming strategic interest to ensure that those rules are reinforced and not weakened , because if we weaken the WTO or the rule of law , who will win ?
The reality here is that we are still in a phase where the basic , real , political issues must be addressed first .
We will never get a common foreign and security policy by one nation demanding that the rest of Europe adopt their common foreign and security policy .
All this must amount to a positive agenda for reform .
Hopefully the next Parliament will have more about it than the present body or the lobbyists will have less about them .
Why do we need yet another body when we have just had three years of self @-@ imposed imposed agon@@ ising over the Constitution ?
But that does not necessarily go in your favour , Mr Barroso .
I voted in the REACH debate as I did because , as a Labour MEP , I support the overall objectives of REACH : the protection of human health and the environment through increased knowledge about potentially hazardous chemicals .
What have we actually achieved after nine years ?
Today &amp; apos ; s resolution looks more like an appeal but not like a European Parliament document .
I regret , Commissioner , that you did not fulfil your task .
There is really no m@@ yst@@ ery about this .
Mr President , I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Lamassoure &amp; apos ; s excellent work as rapporteur .
We spend a lot of time policing ourselves in Europe , but the main problems are countries which are not bound by any scru@@ ples or international rules .
We might then see an end to some of the fraud , corruption and mismanagement that seem en@@ dem@@ ic in some countries and that have to be stopped .
Finally , it is true that food aid and the transport of food aid has - at the insistence of the US and via the decision in the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD - been excluded from what should be covered by un@@ tying of aid .
R@@ emo@@ ving the administrative and technical barriers to companies operating outside their own country is therefore a desirable and important objective and opens up the sector to fair competition .
We provide humanitarian aid in reaction to need , and provide it where that need is , without considering politics .
I am glad to note that the strategy proposed by the Commission in its communication of 23 October was endorsed by the Council last week .
That is what we need .
That is the path to Europe .
To some extent , the tabling of this motion has already brought some answers .
While Parliament largely supported the Commission proposal , there has been no progress in the Council .
We were asked to treat these as a matter of urgency .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I would like to support this report .
The question is : how can reinforced cooperation with the US help us to get there ?
The Ombudsman &amp; apos ; s initiative and recommendations can therefore be warmly welcomed , as can the decision by the Commission to follow them .
I should like to mention some of the proposed amendments and my particular support for them .
This has led to the achievement of a compromise package of amendments , which appears to have been widely accepted by most parliamentary groups , the Council and the Commission .
Particular reference has been made to the importance of different bodies in the Commission working closely together in the cultural field in order to pull the strin@@ gs together .
Ide@@ ally , no patient should have to leave their home country to get medical treatment , but in those cases where it is necessary , they should be able to do so knowing what they are entitled to in terms of treatment and reimbursement .
The differences are honest and real , and therefore demonstrate that a more fundamental change is necessary if Europe is to achieve a true Common Foreign and Security Policy .
Following on from what the Minister has already said , I would like to put two propositions to her .
Parliament &amp; apos ; s report deals with a hugely important subject .
in writing . - I fully agree that the simplification of the CAP should not result in less support for farmers and should not lead to the dismantling of traditional market management instruments .
Without strong European leadership , we could not have achieved the promising results of the Bali Conference , setting a road map for the global agreement we are seeking and that we expect to reach in Copenhagen in 2009 .
The problem is that the regulatory agencies remain very mixed in with the interests of state @-@ owned owned companies .
With those provis@@ os we can broadly welcome both the report - and we congratulate the rapporteurs on their work - and the Amsterdam Treaty .
One of the things on which we agree , on the whole , across this Parliament - though I know there are notable exceptions - is our belief in a functioning single market .
On the other hand , there are a number of proposed amendments which we feel are already dealt with adequately in the current text .
I also hope that everyone in this House will join me in expressing our profound hope that we have reached a turning point in the Middle East , and that we have reached a point where the path of peace and dialogue will start to dis@@ place that of the bomb and the bul@@ let .
The only way to deliver on this is to vote against the Commission as a whole .
We could then prepare a statement that could be read and understood by Members of this Parliament , by members of national parliaments and students of European politics .
However , in the light of Parliament &amp; apos ; s concern over the implementation of the .e@@ u top level domain , the Commission wishes to state the following :
. I voted for this resolution .
Then of course we come to the very difficult subject of EU @-@ Russia Russia relations .
On the political side we obviously have to tread war@@ ily but not so war@@ ily that we do not make progress .
In this vein , I am calling upon all the institutions to adopt measures which will lead to these objectives being fulfilled .
The financial crisis did not origin@@ ate in Europe ; it came to Europe and to the rest of the world from the United States .
The Commission is consulted and the Council must agree to the statute .
Our regulatory framework , which has been in place since 2003 , establishes conditions for competition , investment , growth and jobs , while guaranteeing basic consumer rights .
The same applies to the European monetary and fiscal policies .
Iceland cooper@@ ates closely with EU Member States as a founding member of NATO , a member of the Council of Europe , EFTA , the OSCE and the Schengen Cooperation .
One area that is particularly important , it seems to me , is the question of civil society .
In relation to further progress on the Food Safety Authority , if Parliament would make the appropriations requested by the Commission available to us , this would facilitate our work .
I should like to ask the Commissioner the following points .
In conclusion , may I express the confidence that , with the help of the European Parliament , we can put before the Council an improved Commission proposal , which should facilitate its position vis @-@ à à @-@ vis vis the Council .
It is very much in this context of overwhelming support for the objectives of the ECB and of praise for its achievements so far that my remaining remarks should be seen .
I accept that in your reply you acknowledge that there have been some improvements , but I hope that the Presidency will also accept that we have had lots of recommendations for action before but been a little bit short on action .
That is an aim and objective I think we would all agree with .
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I can say we will be supporting this compromise text on the situation in Burundi .
These exceptions are discre@@ tionary , not as others would have you believe , mandatory .
We need political leadership and political vision .
We need a pan @-@ European European approach to the issue of scan@@ ners - airport security needs to be uniform .
I do not want to see a situation where the larger Member States , such as Italy , are consulted and decide on the future of the Constitution - and indeed Europe - while the smaller Member States are simply told to ratify the text as presented to them .
Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her report , and also Mr Ko@@ fo@@ ed and Mr Kindermann .
On the other hand , we should continue to support Ukraine &amp; apos ; s European integration prospects and to use more car@@ ro@@ ts than sticks in trying to draw Ukraine closer to Europe - and not further away from it - and to do everything in our power to achieve this strategic goal of ours .
I very much value the Commission &amp; apos ; s comments on that .
There is no one view within the Council so as the representative of the presidency , I cannot speak on behalf of the Council .
Would the Commission not accept the spirit of that decision , which was made here just last month by the elected Members of this Parliament ?
Unfortunately , at the moment , there is no European mechanism or institution capable of coordinating an integrated continental recovery and therefore we are re@@ applying patch@@ work solutions that may fail as a whole , since Member States &amp; apos ; economies are highly interdependent .
This is an extremely important issue and I must register a protest at your departure from the procedure which you yourself described at the beginning of the session .
Once more I would like to thank Parliament , and in particular the rapporteur , for their attention to the protection of this important element of the common European identity and heritage that is its common currency .
And that is why I am proud to promote and associate myself with a Europe where we are all equal , regardless of race , ethnicity , religion , belief , age , disability , gender or sexual orientation - a Europe of equals ; a Europe of fundamental values .
I would like to thank you and the shadow rapporteurs again for your important work .
We must make sure the core ILO conventions are actually implemented .
This is the only way to keep Europe competitive .
Could I , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Transport and Tourism , acknowledge the progress that is being made by the Council and in particular by the Committee on Budgets in addressing our concerns .
I have serious problems with all of this , and think we are taking the wrong approach .
This is what has happened in other parts of the world .
The second problem arises from the economic crisis .
Judi@@ cial cooperation is important because it complements the workings of the internal market and the single currency , as already stated .
. I abstained on the amendments and voted against the final report because I am deeply concerned about the lack of balance within this report .
We , along with other groups in this Parliament , are still waiting for the Commission to present a proposal laying down the practical arrangements for the implementation of the code of conduct that would facilitate cooperation and proper scrutiny .
It must be emphasised very strongly that , insofar as this Research Fund has any impact , it must be on safety at work .
Let me conclude by thanking the European Parliament for its constructive and balanced approach towards Bulgaria and Romania &amp; quot ; s accession to the European Union .
It is clear that Indonesia &amp; apos ; s difficulties will not be solved overnight .
Mr President , I thank Commissioner Solbes for his statement .
Fisheries management should be brought into that common sense situation , and jurisdiction should be returned to the Member States so that , for example , countries around the North Sea can work together with those who have most to gain from conservation being encouraged , giving the incentive to make a marine strategy succeed .
Gi@@ ve us at least one week to consult and consider how we will vote .
We cannot allow recovery to be a fig lea@@ f for governments reluctant to reform .
I strongly believe that , with the successful enlargement of the Union , the agreement on the European Constitution , the good progress made over the last six months on the Lisbon Agenda and Justice and Home Affairs , as well as in our relationships with key partners , the Union has made a great step forward .
So I am asking my colleagues to endorse the report , as adopted in committee , and hopefully the new presidency will be able to persuade Member States to take our opinion more carefully into account .
E@@ ss@@ ential attention should be paid to SMEs , which have the highest potential for further development and increased employment .
This concept I wholeheartedly reject .
Mr President , I hope I can risk Mrs I@@ z@@ qu@@ ier@@ do &amp; apos ; s wra@@ th by saying that I agree with the Commissioner .
Perhaps I was too speedy .
Sadly , real life has proved the correctness of this conclusion .
At the same time , a number of important questions remain to be carefully assessed and are currently very closely monitored by the Commission : questions such as cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , refugee returns , respect for minority rights , judicial reform and regional cooperation .
It has the right of initiative .
Any step we take to improve our cooperation in security and justice matters must be matched with an extended protection of the individual citizen &amp; quot ; s human and civic rights .
It also reaffirms the Commission &amp; apos ; s deep conviction that the European Union cannot tolerate any form of racism , xenophobia , discrimination or social exclusion of Roma .
The first is that there must be a sense of shared responsibility .
I want to reinforce what Mrs Grön@@ feldt Berg@@ man said about the role of the small- and medium @-@ sized sized enterprises in this sector .
It is by re@@ connecting with citizens that we can create the conditions for a future comprehensive institutional settlement .
W@@ hen@@ ever possible the operator who has caused the environmental damage - or provoked an imminent threat of such damage occurring - must , in accordance with the polluter pays principle , bear the costs associated with the implementation of the necessary preventive or rest@@ or@@ ative measures .
There are few areas where our policy pre@@ tensions and our actual effort stand in starker contrast than in the area of common foreign and security policy .
If this is true it is most welcome .
My group believes that we should be building on the Geneva Convention and that hopefully a common asylum policy will eventually do that .
They are outlined in the European Treaties .
We left the field open to the Constitution &amp; apos ; s detra@@ ctors and there is little sign yet that France will have a more ser@@ ene or informed debate on its place in Europe in the run @-@ up up to next May &amp; apos ; s elections , or that the Netherlands , emerging from elections last week , has really made up its mind .
It calls for the goal to make Europe the most energy @-@ efficient efficient economy in the world by setting targets for annual reduction in energy of the order of 2.5 % to 3 % and for a robust strategy for Montreal .
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities .
They contain tens of thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel and over 100 tonnes of separ@@ ated pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um between them .
Mr President , I wanted to make a comment on the minutes .
I just do not believe it .
We should remember - and the Commission proposal and Parliament &amp; apos ; s response highlight the fact - that third @-@ generation generation mobile telep@@ hon@@ es , on which so much of our future depends , are an area where clearly the European Union has an important lead , and that this lead is partly , though not wholly , explained by intervention .
Other amendments cover minor issues that could better be settled in the framework of the implementing rules .
What we need most to turn ambition into action is political will - on both sides of the Mediterranean .
We urgently need data protection in the third pillar and I wish the Commission would push harder for that .
Madam President , I would like to congratulate Mr Mitchell and Mr Van den Berg on their excellent work on the development cooperation instrument .
It is up to us to get involved in this initiative to ensure that it serves the competitiveness of our economy .
Other ideas and suggestions have been put forward , which will be given due consideration by the Commission .
However , we must guard against complacency to ensure that , in the long term , more binding and transparent legislation is forthcoming .
I welcome the production of this report by Mr Nassauer and I support its key recommendations .
We have the obligation to inform the public on all the beneficiaries , so we hope that with these transparency obligations we will also see major change with regard to public awareness and the integrity of the whole process .
I should like to say first of all to Mrs Torres Marques that she has produced an extremely comprehensive report with a lot of good ideas in it .
For your people &amp; apos ; s peace , prosperity and security depend upon it .
For us this too is problematic .
